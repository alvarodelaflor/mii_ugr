The transatlantic steamship \xe2\x80\x98La Provence\xe2\x80\x99 was a swift\r\nand comfortable vessel, under the command of a most affable man. The\r\npassengers constituted a select and delightful society. The charm of\r\nnew acquaintances and improvised amusements served to make the time pass\r\nagreeably. We enjoyed the pleasant sensation of being separated from\r\nthe world, living, as it were, upon an unknown island, and consequently\r\nobliged to be sociable with each other.\r\n\r\nHave you ever stopped to consider how much originality and spontaneity\r\nemanate from these various individuals who, on the preceding evening,\r\ndid not even know each other, and who are now, for several days,\r\ncondemned to lead a life of extreme intimacy, jointly defying the anger\r\nof the ocean, the terrible onslaught of the waves, the violence of the\r\ntempest and the agonizing monotony of the calm and sleepy water? Such\r\na life becomes a sort of tragic existence, with its storms and its\r\ngrandeurs, its monotony and its diversity; and that is why, perhaps,\r\nwe embark upon that short voyage with mingled feelings of pleasure and\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nBut, during the past few years, a new sensation had been added to the\r\nlife of the transatlantic traveler. The little floating island is now\r\nattached to the world from which it was once quite free. A bond united\r\nthem, even in the very heart of the watery wastes of the Atlantic. That\r\nbond is the wireless telegraph, by means of which we receive news in\r\nthe most mysterious manner. We know full well that the message is not\r\ntransported by the medium of a hollow wire. No, the mystery is even more\r\ninexplicable, more romantic, and we must have recourse to the wings of\r\nthe air in order to explain this new miracle. During the first day of\r\nthe voyage, we felt that we were being followed, escorted, preceded\r\neven, by that distant voice, which, from time to time, whispered to one\r\nof us a few words from the receding world. Two friends spoke to me. Ten,\r\ntwenty others sent gay or somber words of parting to other passengers.\r\n\r\nOn the second day, at a distance of five hundred miles from the French\r\ncoast, in the midst of a violent storm, we received the following\r\nmessage by means of the wireless telegraph:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is on your vessel, first cabin, blonde hair, wound right\r\nfore-arm, traveling alone under name of R........\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment, a terrible flash of lightning rent the stormy skies.\r\nThe electric waves were interrupted. The remainder of the dispatch never\r\nreached us. Of the name under which Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was concealing himself,\r\nwe knew only the initial.\r\n\r\nIf the news had been of some other character, I have no doubt that the\r\nsecret would have been carefully guarded by the telegraphic operator as\r\nwell as by the officers of the vessel. But it was one of those events\r\ncalculated to escape from the most rigorous discretion. The same day, no\r\none knew how, the incident became a matter of current gossip and every\r\npassenger was aware that the famous Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was hiding in our\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin in our midst! the irresponsible burglar whose exploits\r\nhad been narrated in all the newspapers during the past few months! the\r\nmysterious individual with whom Ganimard, our shrewdest detective,\r\nhad been engaged in an implacable conflict amidst interesting and\r\npicturesque surroundings. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, the eccentric gentleman who\r\noperates only in the ch\xc3\xa2teaux and salons, and who, one night, entered\r\nthe residence of Baron Schormann, but emerged empty-handed, leaving,\r\nhowever, his card on which he had scribbled these words: \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\r\ngentleman-burglar, will return when the furniture is genuine.\xe2\x80\x9d Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin, the man of a thousand disguises: in turn a chauffer, detective,\r\nbookmaker, Russian physician, Spanish bull-fighter, commercial traveler,\r\nrobust youth, or decrepit old man.\r\n\r\nThen consider this startling situation: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was wandering about\r\nwithin the limited bounds of a transatlantic steamer; in that very small\r\ncorner of the world, in that dining saloon, in that smoking room, in\r\nthat music room! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was, perhaps, this gentleman.... or that\r\none.... my neighbor at the table.... the sharer of my stateroom....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this condition of affairs will last for five days!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss\r\nNelly Underdown, next morning. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is unbearable! I hope he will be\r\narrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, addressing me, she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Andr\xc3\xa9zy, you are on intimate terms with the\r\ncaptain; surely you know something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should have been delighted had I possessed any information that would\r\ninterest Miss Nelly. She was one of those magnificent creatures who\r\ninevitably attract attention in every assembly. Wealth and beauty form\r\nan irresistible combination, and Nelly possessed both.\r\n\r\nEducated in Paris under the care of a French mother, she was now going\r\nto visit her father, the millionaire Underdown of Chicago. She was\r\naccompanied by one of her friends, Lady Jerland.\r\n\r\nAt first, I had decided to open a flirtation with her; but, in the\r\nrapidly growing intimacy of the voyage, I was soon impressed by her\r\ncharming manner and my feelings became too deep and reverential for a\r\nmere flirtation. Moreover, she accepted my attentions with a certain\r\ndegree of favor. She condescended to laugh at my witticisms and display\r\nan interest in my stories. Yet I felt that I had a rival in the person\r\nof a young man with quiet and refined tastes; and it struck me, at\r\ntimes, that she preferred his taciturn humor to my Parisian frivolity.\r\nHe formed one in the circle of admirers that surrounded Miss Nelly\r\nat the time she addressed to me the foregoing question. We were all\r\ncomfortably seated in our deck-chairs. The storm of the preceding\r\nevening had cleared the sky. The weather was now delightful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no definite knowledge, mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut can not\r\nwe, ourselves, investigate the mystery quite as well as the detective\r\nGanimard, the personal enemy of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! you are progressing very fast, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, mademoiselle. In the first place, let me ask, do you find\r\nthe problem a complicated one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery complicated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you forgotten the key we hold for the solution to the problem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat key?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, Lupin calls himself Monsieur R-------.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather vague information,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecondly, he is traveling alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that help you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirdly, he is blonde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we have only to peruse the passenger-list, and proceed by process\r\nof elimination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had that list in my pocket. I took it out and glanced through it. Then\r\nI remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find that there are only thirteen men on the passenger-list whose\r\nnames begin with the letter R.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly thirteen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in the first cabin. And of those thirteen, I find that nine of\r\nthem are accompanied by women, children or servants. That leaves only\r\nfour who are traveling alone. First, the Marquis de Raverdan----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecretary to the American Ambassador,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Miss Nelly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Rawson,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d some one said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon. Rivolta.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed an Italian, whose face was concealed beneath a heavy\r\nblack beard.\r\n\r\nMiss Nelly burst into laughter, and exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cThat gentleman can\r\nscarcely be called a blonde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are forced to the conclusion that the\r\nguilty party is the last one on the list.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon. Rozaine. Does anyone know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one answered. But Miss Nelly turned to the taciturn young man, whose\r\nattentions to her had annoyed me, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Monsieur Rozaine, why do you not answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes were now turned upon him. He was a blonde. I must confess\r\nthat I myself felt a shock of surprise, and the profound silence that\r\nfollowed her question indicated that the others present also viewed\r\nthe situation with a feeling of sudden alarm. However, the idea was an\r\nabsurd one, because the gentleman in question presented an air of the\r\nmost perfect innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I not answer?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause, considering my name, my\r\nposition as a solitary traveler and the color of my hair, I have already\r\nreached the same conclusion, and now think that I should be arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe presented a strange appearance as he uttered these words. His thin\r\nlips were drawn closer than usual and his face was ghastly pale, whilst\r\nhis eyes were streaked with blood. Of course, he was joking, yet his\r\nappearance and attitude impressed us strangely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have not the wound?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nelly, naively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI lack the wound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he pulled up his sleeve, removing his cuff, and showed us his arm.\r\nBut that action did not deceive me. He had shown us his left arm, and\r\nI was on the point of calling his attention to the fact, when another\r\nincident diverted our attention. Lady Jerland, Miss Nelly\xe2\x80\x99s friend, came\r\nrunning towards us in a state of great excitement, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy jewels, my pearls! Some one has stolen them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, they were not all gone, as we soon found out. The thief had taken\r\nonly part of them; a very curious thing. Of the diamond sunbursts,\r\njeweled pendants, bracelets and necklaces, the thief had taken, not\r\nthe largest but the finest and most valuable stones. The mountings were\r\nlying upon the table. I saw them there, despoiled of their jewels, like\r\nflowers from which the beautiful colored petals had been ruthlessly\r\nplucked. And this theft must have been committed at the time Lady\r\nJerland was taking her tea; in broad daylight, in a stateroom opening\r\non a much frequented corridor; moreover, the thief had been obliged to\r\nforce open the door of the stateroom, search for the jewel-case, which\r\nwas hidden at the bottom of a hat-box, open it, select his booty and\r\nremove it from the mountings.\r\n\r\nOf course, all the passengers instantly reached the same conclusion; it\r\nwas the work of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\nThat day, at the dinner table, the seats to the right and left of\r\nRozaine remained vacant; and, during the evening, it was rumored that\r\nthe captain had placed him under arrest, which information produced a\r\nfeeling of safety and relief. We breathed once more. That evening, we\r\nresumed our games and dances. Miss Nelly, especially, displayed a spirit\r\nof thoughtless gayety which convinced me that if Rozaine\xe2\x80\x99s attentions\r\nhad been agreeable to her in the beginning, she had already forgotten\r\nthem. Her charm and good-humor completed my conquest. At midnight, under\r\na bright moon, I declared my devotion with an ardor that did not seem to\r\ndisplease her.\r\n\r\nBut, next day, to our general amazement, Rozaine was at liberty.\r\nWe learned that the evidence against him was not sufficient. He had\r\nproduced documents that were perfectly regular, which showed that he\r\nwas the son of a wealthy merchant of Bordeaux. Besides, his arms did not\r\nbear the slightest trace of a wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDocuments! Certificates of birth!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the enemies of Rozaine,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cof course, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin will furnish you as many as you desire. And as\r\nto the wound, he never had it, or he has removed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it was proven that, at the time of the theft, Rozaine was\r\npromenading on the deck. To which fact, his enemies replied that a man\r\nlike Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin could commit a crime without being actually present.\r\nAnd then, apart from all other circumstances, there remained one point\r\nwhich even the most skeptical could not answer: Who except Rozaine, was\r\ntraveling alone, was a blonde, and bore a name beginning with R? To whom\r\ndid the telegram point, if it were not Rozaine?\r\n\r\nAnd when Rozaine, a few minutes before breakfast, came boldly toward our\r\ngroup, Miss Nelly and Lady Jerland arose and walked away.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, a manuscript circular was passed from hand to hand\r\namongst the sailors, the stewards, and the passengers of all classes.\r\nIt announced that Mon. Louis Rozaine offered a reward of ten thousand\r\nfrancs for the discovery of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin or other person in possession\r\nof the stolen jewels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if no one assists me, I will unmask the scoundrel myself,\xe2\x80\x9d declared\r\nRozaine.\r\n\r\nRozaine against Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, or rather, according to current opinion,\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin himself against Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin; the contest promised to be\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nNothing developed during the next two days. We saw Rozaine wandering\r\nabout, day and night, searching, questioning, investigating. The\r\ncaptain, also, displayed commendable activity. He caused the vessel to\r\nbe searched from stem to stern; ransacked every stateroom under the\r\nplausible theory that the jewels might be concealed anywhere, except in\r\nthe thief\xe2\x80\x99s own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they will find out something soon,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Nelly to\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may be a wizard, but he cannot make diamonds and pearls become\r\ninvisible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he should examine the lining of our\r\nhats and vests and everything we carry with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, exhibiting my Kodak, a 9x12 with which I had been photographing\r\nher in various poses, I added: \xe2\x80\x9cIn an apparatus no larger than that, a\r\nperson could hide all of Lady Jerland\xe2\x80\x99s jewels. He could pretend to take\r\npictures and no one would suspect the game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have heard it said that every thief leaves some clue behind him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be generally true,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is one exception:\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he concentrates his thoughts not only on the theft, but on all\r\nthe circumstances connected with it that could serve as a clue to his\r\nidentity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few days ago, you were more confident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but since then I have seen him at work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you think about it now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in my opinion, we are wasting our time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, as a matter of fact, the investigation had produced no result. But,\r\nin the meantime, the captain\xe2\x80\x99s watch had been stolen. He was furious. He\r\nquickened his efforts and watched Rozaine more closely than before. But,\r\non the following day, the watch was found in the second officer\xe2\x80\x99s collar\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nThis incident caused considerable astonishment, and displayed the\r\nhumorous side of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, burglar though he was, but dilettante as\r\nwell. He combined business with pleasure. He reminded us of the\r\nauthor who almost died in a fit of laughter provoked by his own play.\r\nCertainly, he was an artist in his particular line of work, and whenever\r\nI saw Rozaine, gloomy and reserved, and thought of the double role that\r\nhe was playing, I accorded him a certain measure of admiration.\r\n\r\nOn the following evening, the officer on deck duty heard groans\r\nemanating from the darkest corner of the ship. He approached and found a\r\nman lying there, his head enveloped in a thick gray scarf and his hands\r\ntied together with a heavy cord. It was Rozaine. He had been assaulted,\r\nthrown down and robbed. A card, pinned to his coat, bore these words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin accepts with pleasure the ten thousand francs offered by\r\nMon. Rozaine.\xe2\x80\x9d As a matter of fact, the stolen pocket-book contained\r\ntwenty thousand francs.\r\n\r\nOf course, some accused the unfortunate man of having simulated this\r\nattack on himself. But, apart from the fact that he could not have bound\r\nhimself in that manner, it was established that the writing on the\r\ncard was entirely different from that of Rozaine, but, on the contrary,\r\nresembled the handwriting of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin as it was reproduced in an old\r\nnewspaper found on board.\r\n\r\nThus it appeared that Rozaine was not Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin; but was Rozaine, the\r\nson of a Bordeaux merchant. And the presence of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was once\r\nmore affirmed, and that in a most alarming manner.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of terror amongst the passengers that none would\r\nremain alone in a stateroom or wander singly in unfrequented parts of\r\nthe vessel. We clung together as a matter of safety. And yet the most\r\nintimate acquaintances were estranged by a mutual feeling of distrust.\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was, now, anybody and everybody. Our excited imaginations\r\nattributed to him miraculous and unlimited power. We supposed him\r\ncapable of assuming the most unexpected disguises; of being, by turns,\r\nthe highly respectable Major Rawson or the noble Marquis de Raverdan,\r\nor even--for we no longer stopped with the accusing letter of R--or even\r\nsuch or such a person well known to all of us, and having wife, children\r\nand servants.\r\n\r\nThe first wireless dispatches from America brought no news; at\r\nleast, the captain did not communicate any to us. The silence was not\r\nreassuring.\r\n\r\nOur last day on the steamer seemed interminable. We lived in constant\r\nfear of some disaster. This time, it would not be a simple theft or a\r\ncomparatively harmless assault; it would be a crime, a murder. No one\r\nimagined that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would confine himself to those two trifling\r\noffenses. Absolute master of the ship, the authorities powerless, he\r\ncould do whatever he pleased; our property and lives were at his mercy.\r\n\r\nYet those were delightful hours for me, since they secured to me the\r\nconfidence of Miss Nelly. Deeply moved by those startling events and\r\nbeing of a highly nervous nature, she spontaneously sought at my side\r\na protection and security that I was pleased to give her. Inwardly, I\r\nblessed Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Had he not been the means of bringing me and\r\nMiss Nelly closer to each other? Thanks to him, I could now indulge in\r\ndelicious dreams of love and happiness--dreams that, I felt, were not\r\nunwelcome to Miss Nelly. Her smiling eyes authorized me to make them;\r\nthe softness of her voice bade me hope.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the American shore, the active search for the thief was\r\napparently abandoned, and we were anxiously awaiting the supreme moment\r\nin which the mysterious enigma would be explained. Who was Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin? Under what name, under what disguise was the famous Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nconcealing himself? And, at last, that supreme moment arrived. If I live\r\none hundred years, I shall not forget the slightest details of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow pale you are, Miss Nelly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to my companion, as she leaned\r\nupon my arm, almost fainting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cah! you are so changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think! this is a most exciting moment, and I am delighted to\r\nspend it with you, Miss Nelly. I hope that your memory will sometimes\r\nrevert---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she was not listening. She was nervous and excited. The gangway was\r\nplaced in position, but, before we could use it, the uniformed customs\r\nofficers came on board. Miss Nelly murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to hear that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin escaped from the\r\nvessel during the voyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he preferred death to dishonor, and plunged into the Atlantic\r\nrather than be arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I started, and, in answer to her question, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that little old man standing at the bottom of the gangway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith an umbrella and an olive-green coat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the celebrated detective who has sworn to capture Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\nAh! I can understand now why we did not receive any news from this side\r\nof the Atlantic. Ganimard was here! and he always keeps his business\r\nsecret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think he will arrest Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can tell? The unexpected always happens when Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is\r\nconcerned in the affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with that morbid curiosity peculiar to women, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould like to see him arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to be patient. No doubt, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has already seen\r\nhis enemy and will not be in a hurry to leave the steamer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe passengers were now leaving the steamer. Leaning on his umbrella,\r\nwith an air of careless indifference, Ganimard appeared to be paying no\r\nattention to the crowd that was hurrying down the gangway. The Marquis\r\nde Raverdan, Major Rawson, the Italian Rivolta, and many others had\r\nalready left the vessel before Rozaine appeared. Poor Rozaine!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is he, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nelly to me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be very interesting to have Ganimard and Rozaine in\r\nthe same picture. You take the camera. I am loaded down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave her the camera, but too late for her to use it. Rozaine was\r\nalready passing the detective. An American officer, standing behind\r\nGanimard, leaned forward and whispered in his ear. The French detective\r\nshrugged his shoulders and Rozaine passed on. Then, my God, who was\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Nelly, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot more than twenty people now remained on board. She scrutinized them\r\none by one, fearful that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was not amongst them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot wait much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to her.\r\n\r\nShe started toward the gangway. I followed. But we had not taken ten\r\nsteps when Ganimard barred our passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, monsieur. What\xe2\x80\x99s your hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am escorting mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, in a tone of authority. Then, gazing into my\r\neyes, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed, and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, simply Bernard d\xe2\x80\x99Andr\xc3\xa9zy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBernard d\xe2\x80\x99Andr\xc3\xa9zy died in Macedonia three years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Bernard d\xe2\x80\x99Andr\xc3\xa9zy were dead, I should not be here. But you are\r\nmistaken. Here are my papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are his; and I can tell you exactly how they came into your\r\npossession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin sailed under the name of\r\nR---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, another of your tricks; a false scent that deceived them at Havre.\r\nYou play a good game, my boy, but this time luck is against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated a moment. Then he hit me a sharp blow on the right arm,\r\nwhich caused me to utter a cry of pain. He had struck the wound, yet\r\nunhealed, referred to in the telegram.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to surrender. There was no alternative. I turned to Miss\r\nNelly, who had heard everything. Our eyes met; then she glanced at the\r\nKodak I had placed in her hands, and made a gesture that conveyed to me\r\nthe impression that she understood everything. Yes, there, between the\r\nnarrow folds of black leather, in the hollow centre of the small object\r\nthat I had taken the precaution to place in her hands before Ganimard\r\narrested me, it was there I had deposited Rozaine\xe2\x80\x99s twenty thousand\r\nfrancs and Lady Jerland\xe2\x80\x99s pearls and diamonds.\r\n\r\nOh! I pledge my oath that, at that solemn moment, when I was in the\r\ngrasp of Ganimard and his two assistants, I was perfectly indifferent to\r\neverything, to my arrest, the hostility of the people, everything\r\nexcept this one question: what will Miss Nelly do with the things I had\r\nconfided to her?\r\n\r\nIn the absence of that material and conclusive proof, I had nothing\r\nto fear; but would Miss Nelly decide to furnish that proof? Would she\r\nbetray me? Would she act the part of an enemy who cannot forgive, or\r\nthat of a woman whose scorn is softened by feelings of indulgence and\r\ninvoluntary sympathy?\r\n\r\nShe passed in front of me. I said nothing, but bowed very low. Mingled\r\nwith the other passengers, she advanced to the gangway with my Kodak\r\nin her hand. It occurred to me that she would not dare to expose me\r\npublicly, but she might do so when she reached a more private place.\r\nHowever, when she had passed only a few feet down the gangway, with\r\na movement of simulated awkwardness, she let the camera fall into the\r\nwater between the vessel and the pier. Then she walked down the gangway,\r\nand was quickly lost to sight in the crowd. She had passed out of my\r\nlife forever.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, I stood motionless. Then, to Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\nastonishment, I muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity that I am not an honest man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the story of his arrest as narrated to me by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nhimself. The various incidents, which I shall record in writing at a\r\nlater day, have established between us certain ties.... shall I say of\r\nfriendship? Yes, I venture to believe that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin honors me with\r\nhis friendship, and that it is through friendship that he occasionally\r\ncalls on me, and brings, into the silence of my library, his youthful\r\nexuberance of spirits, the contagion of his enthusiasm, and the mirth of\r\na man for whom destiny has naught but favors and smiles.\r\n\r\nHis portrait? How can I describe him? I have seen him twenty times and\r\neach time he was a different person; even he himself said to me on one\r\noccasion: \xe2\x80\x9cI no longer know who I am. I cannot recognize myself in the\r\nmirror.\xe2\x80\x9d Certainly, he was a great actor, and possessed a marvelous\r\nfaculty for disguising himself. Without the slightest effort, he could\r\nadopt the voice, gestures and mannerisms of another person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should I retain a definite form and feature? Why\r\nnot avoid the danger of a personality that is ever the same? My actions\r\nwill serve to identify me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he added, with a touch of pride:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better if no one can ever say with absolute certainty:\r\nThere is Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! The essential point is that the public may be\r\nable to refer to my work and say, without fear of mistake: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\ndid that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin in Prison\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no tourist worthy of the name who does not know the banks of\r\nthe Seine, and has not noticed, in passing, the little feudal castle of\r\nthe Malaquis, built upon a rock in the centre of the river. An arched\r\nbridge connects it with the shore. All around it, the calm waters of the\r\ngreat river play peacefully amongst the reeds, and the wagtails flutter\r\nover the moist crests of the stones.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Malaquis castle is stormy like its name, harsh like\r\nits outlines. It has passed through a long series of combats, sieges,\r\nassaults, rapines and massacres. A recital of the crimes that have been\r\ncommitted there would cause the stoutest heart to tremble. There are\r\nmany mysterious legends connected with the castle, and they tell us of\r\na famous subterranean tunnel that formerly led to the abbey of Jumieges\r\nand to the manor of Agnes Sorel, mistress of Charles VII.\r\n\r\nIn that ancient habitation of heroes and brigands, the Baron Nathan\r\nCahorn now lived; or Baron Satan as he was formerly called on the\r\nBourse, where he had acquired a fortune with incredible rapidity. The\r\nlords of Malaquis, absolutely ruined, had been obliged to sell\r\nthe ancient castle at a great sacrifice. It contained an admirable\r\ncollection of furniture, pictures, wood carvings, and faience. The Baron\r\nlived there alone, attended by three old servants. No one ever enters\r\nthe place. No one had ever beheld the three Rubens that he possessed,\r\nhis two Watteau, his Jean Goujon pulpit, and the many other treasures\r\nthat he had acquired by a vast expenditure of money at public sales.\r\n\r\nBaron Satan lived in constant fear, not for himself, but for the\r\ntreasures that he had accumulated with such an earnest devotion and with\r\nso much perspicacity that the shrewdest merchant could not say that\r\nthe Baron had ever erred in his taste or judgment. He loved them--his\r\nbibelots. He loved them intensely, like a miser; jealously, like a\r\nlover. Every day, at sunset, the iron gates at either end of the bridge\r\nand at the entrance to the court of honor are closed and barred. At\r\nthe least touch on these gates, electric bells will ring throughout the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nOne Thursday in September, a letter-carrier presented himself at the\r\ngate at the head of the bridge, and, as usual, it was the Baron himself\r\nwho partially opened the heavy portal. He scrutinized the man as\r\nminutely as if he were a stranger, although the honest face and\r\ntwinkling eyes of the postman had been familiar to the Baron for many\r\nyears. The man laughed, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only I, Monsieur le Baron. It is not another man wearing my cap\r\nand blouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can never tell,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the Baron.\r\n\r\nThe man handed him a number of newspapers, and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Monsieur le Baron, here is something new.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething new?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a letter. A registered letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiving as a recluse, without friends or business relations, the baron\r\nnever received any letters, and the one now presented to him immediately\r\naroused within him a feeling of suspicion and distrust. It was like an\r\nevil omen. Who was this mysterious correspondent that dared to disturb\r\nthe tranquility of his retreat?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must sign for it, Monsieur le Baron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe signed; then took the letter, waited until the postman had\r\ndisappeared beyond the bend in the road, and, after walking nervously to\r\nand fro for a few minutes, he leaned against the parapet of the bridge\r\nand opened the envelope. It contained a sheet of paper, bearing this\r\nheading: Prison de la Sant\xc3\xa9, Paris. He looked at the signature: Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin. Then he read:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le Baron:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is, in the gallery in your castle, a picture of Philippe\r\n  de Champaigne, of exquisite finish, which pleases me beyond\r\n  measure.  Your Rubens are also to my taste, as well as your\r\n  smallest Watteau.  In the salon to the right, I have noticed the\r\n  Louis XIII cadence-table, the tapestries of Beauvais, the Empire\r\n  gueridon signed \xe2\x80\x98Jacob,\xe2\x80\x99 and the Renaissance chest.  In the salon\r\n  to the left, all the cabinet full of jewels and miniatures.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cFor the present, I will content myself with those articles that\r\n  can be conveniently removed.  I will therefore ask you to pack\r\n  them carefully and ship them to me, charges prepaid, to the\r\n  station at Batignolles, within eight days, otherwise I shall be\r\n  obliged to remove them myself during the night of 27 September;\r\n  but, under those circumstances, I shall not content myself with\r\n  the articles above mentioned.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAccept my apologies for any inconvenience I may cause you, and\r\n  believe me to be your humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                            \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cP. S.--Please do not send the largest Watteau.  Although you\r\n  paid thirty thousand francs for it, it is only a copy, the\r\n  original having been burned, under the Directoire by Barras,\r\n  during a night of debauchery.  Consult the memoirs of Garat.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cI do not care for the Louis XV chatelaine, as I doubt its\r\n  authenticity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat letter completely upset the baron. Had it borne any other\r\nsignature, he would have been greatly alarmed--but signed by Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin!\r\n\r\nAs an habitual reader of the newspapers, he was versed in the history\r\nof recent crimes, and was therefore well acquainted with the exploits of\r\nthe mysterious burglar. Of course, he knew that Lupin had been arrested\r\nin America by his enemy Ganimard and was at present incarcerated in the\r\nPrison de la Sant\xc3\xa9. But he knew also that any miracle might be expected\r\nfrom Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Moreover, that exact knowledge of the castle, the\r\nlocation of the pictures and furniture, gave the affair an alarming\r\naspect. How could he have acquired that information concerning things\r\nthat no one had ever seen?\r\n\r\nThe baron raised his eyes and contemplated the stern outlines of the\r\ncastle, its steep rocky pedestal, the depth of the surrounding water,\r\nand shrugged his shoulders. Certainly, there was no danger. No one in\r\nthe world could force an entrance to the sanctuary that contained his\r\npriceless treasures.\r\n\r\nNo one, perhaps, but Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! For him, gates, walls and drawbridges\r\ndid not exist. What use were the most formidable obstacles or the most\r\ncareful precautions, if Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had decided to effect an entrance?\r\n\r\nThat evening, he wrote to the Procurer of the Republique at Rouen. He\r\nenclosed the threatening letter and solicited aid and protection.\r\n\r\nThe reply came at once to the effect that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was in custody in\r\nthe Prison de la Sant\xc3\xa9, under close surveillance, with no opportunity\r\nto write such a letter, which was, no doubt, the work of some imposter.\r\nBut, as an act of precaution, the Procurer had submitted the letter\r\nto an expert in handwriting, who declared that, in spite of certain\r\nresemblances, the writing was not that of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nBut the words \xe2\x80\x9cin spite of certain resemblances\xe2\x80\x9d caught the attention of\r\nthe baron; in them, he read the possibility of a doubt which appeared to\r\nhim quite sufficient to warrant the intervention of the law. His fears\r\nincreased. He read Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s letter over and over again. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\nobliged to remove them myself.\xe2\x80\x9d And then there was the fixed date: the\r\nnight of 27 September.\r\n\r\nTo confide in his servants was a proceeding repugnant to his nature; but\r\nnow, for the first time in many years, he experienced the necessity of\r\nseeking counsel with some one. Abandoned by the legal official of\r\nhis own district, and feeling unable to defend himself with his own\r\nresources, he was on the point of going to Paris to engage the services\r\nof a detective.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed; on the third day, he was filled with hope and joy as\r\nhe read the following item in the \xe2\x80\x98Reveil de Caudebec\xe2\x80\x99, a newspaper\r\npublished in a neighboring town:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have the pleasure of entertaining in our city, at the present time,\r\nthe veteran detective Mon. Ganimard who acquired a world-wide reputation\r\nby his clever capture of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. He has come here for rest and\r\nrecreation, and, being an enthusiastic fisherman, he threatens to\r\ncapture all the fish in our river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard! Ah, here is the assistance desired by Baron Cahorn! Who could\r\nbaffle the schemes of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin better than Ganimard, the patient and\r\nastute detective? He was the man for the place.\r\n\r\nThe baron did not hesitate. The town of Caudebec was only six kilometers\r\nfrom the castle, a short distance to a man whose step was accelerated by\r\nthe hope of safety.\r\n\r\nAfter several fruitless attempts to ascertain the detective\xe2\x80\x99s address,\r\nthe baron visited the office of the \xe2\x80\x98Reveil,\xe2\x80\x99 situated on the quai.\r\nThere he found the writer of the article who, approaching the window,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard? Why, you are sure to see him somewhere on the quai with his\r\nfishing-pole. I met him there and chanced to read his name engraved on\r\nhis rod. Ah, there he is now, under the trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat little man, wearing a straw hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. He is a gruff fellow, with little to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, the baron approached the celebrated Ganimard,\r\nintroduced himself, and sought to commence a conversation, but that\r\nwas a failure. Then he broached the real object of his interview,\r\nand briefly stated his case. The other listened, motionless, with his\r\nattention riveted on his fishing-rod. When the baron had finished his\r\nstory, the fisherman turned, with an air of profound pity, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, it is not customary for thieves to warn people they are about\r\nto rob. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, especially, would not commit such a folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, if I had the least doubt, believe me, the pleasure of\r\nagain capturing Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would place me at your disposal. But,\r\nunfortunately, that young man is already under lock and key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one ever escaped from the Sant\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, he---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, no more than any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he escapes, so much the better. I will catch him again.\r\nMeanwhile, you go home and sleep soundly. That will do for the present.\r\nYou frighten the fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation was ended. The baron returned to the castle, reassured\r\nto some extent by Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s indifference. He examined the bolts,\r\nwatched the servants, and, during the next forty-eight hours, he became\r\nalmost persuaded that his fears were groundless. Certainly, as Ganimard\r\nhad said, thieves do not warn people they are about to rob.\r\n\r\nThe fateful day was close at hand. It was now the twenty-sixth of\r\nSeptember and nothing had happened. But at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the bell rang.\r\nA boy brought this telegram:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo goods at Batignolles station. Prepare everything for tomorrow night.\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis telegram threw the baron into such a state of excitement that he\r\neven considered the advisability of yielding to Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s demands.\r\n\r\nHowever, he hastened to Caudebec. Ganimard was fishing at the same\r\nplace, seated on a campstool. Without a word, he handed him the\r\ntelegram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the detective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it? But it is tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe robbery! The pillage of my collections!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard laid down his fishing-rod, turned to the baron, and exclaimed,\r\nin a tone of impatience:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Do you think I am going to bother myself about such a silly story\r\nas that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you ask to pass tomorrow night in the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a sou. Now, leave me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName your own price. I am rich and can pay it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis offer disconcerted Ganimard, who replied, calmly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here on a vacation. I have no right to undertake such work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will know. I promise to keep it secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! nothing will happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! three thousand francs. Will that be enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe detective, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. But I must warn you that you are throwing your money out of\r\nthe window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case... but, after all, what do we know about this devil Lupin!\r\nHe may have quite a numerous band of robbers with him. Are you sure of\r\nyour servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not count on them. I will telegraph for two of my men to help\r\nme. And now, go! It is better for us not to be seen together. Tomorrow\r\nevening about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe following day--the date fixed by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin--Baron Cahorn arranged\r\nall his panoply of war, furbished his weapons, and, like a sentinel,\r\npaced to and fro in front of the castle. He saw nothing, heard nothing.\r\nAt half-past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, he dismissed his servants.\r\nThey occupied rooms in a wing of the building, in a retired spot, well\r\nremoved from the main portion of the castle. Shortly thereafter, the\r\nbaron heard the sound of approaching footsteps. It was Ganimard and his\r\ntwo assistants--great, powerful fellows with immense hands, and necks\r\nlike bulls. After asking a few questions relating to the location of the\r\nvarious entrances and rooms, Ganimard carefully closed and barricaded\r\nall the doors and windows through which one could gain access to the\r\nthreatened rooms. He inspected the walls, raised the tapestries, and\r\nfinally installed his assistants in the central gallery which was\r\nlocated between the two salons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo nonsense! We are not here to sleep. At the slightest sound, open the\r\nwindows of the court and call me. Pay attention also to the water-side.\r\nTen metres of perpendicular rock is no obstacle to those devils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard locked his assistants in the gallery, carried away the keys,\r\nand said to the baron:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, to our post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had chosen for himself a small room located in the thick outer wall,\r\nbetween the two principal doors, and which, in former years, had been\r\nthe watchman\xe2\x80\x99s quarters. A peep-hole opened upon the bridge; another on\r\nthe court. In one corner, there was an opening to a tunnel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you told me, Monsieur le Baron, that this tunnel is the only\r\nsubterranean entrance to the castle and that it has been closed up for\r\ntime immemorial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, unless there is some other entrance, known only to Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\r\nwe are quite safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed three chairs together, stretched himself upon them, lighted\r\nhis pipe and sighed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Monsieur le Baron, I feel ashamed to accept your money for such\r\na sinecure as this. I will tell the story to my friend Lupin. He will\r\nenjoy it immensely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baron did not laugh. He was anxiously listening, but heard nothing\r\nsave the beating of his own heart. From time to time, he leaned over the\r\ntunnel and cast a fearful eye into its depths. He heard the clock strike\r\neleven, twelve, one.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he seized Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s arm. The latter leaped up, awakened from\r\nhis sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the baron, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was snoring, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, it is the horn of an automobile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! it is very improbable that Lupin would use an automobile like a\r\nbattering-ram to demolish your castle. Come, Monsieur le Baron, return\r\nto your post. I am going to sleep. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the only alarm. Ganimard resumed his interrupted slumbers, and\r\nthe baron heard nothing except the regular snoring of his companion. At\r\nbreak of day, they left the room. The castle was enveloped in a profound\r\ncalm; it was a peaceful dawn on the bosom of a tranquil river. They\r\nmounted the stairs, Cahorn radiant with joy, Ganimard calm as usual.\r\nThey heard no sound; they saw nothing to arouse suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you, Monsieur le Baron? Really, I should not have\r\naccepted your offer. I am ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door and entered the gallery. Upon two chairs, with\r\ndrooping heads and pendent arms, the detective\xe2\x80\x99s two assistants were\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonnerre de nom d\xe2\x80\x99un chien!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ganimard. At the same moment,\r\nthe baron cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pictures! The credence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stammered, choked, with arms outstretched toward the empty places,\r\ntoward the denuded walls where naught remained but the useless nails\r\nand cords. The Watteau, disappeared! The Rubens, carried away! The\r\ntapestries taken down! The cabinets, despoiled of their jewels!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my Louis XVI candelabra! And the Regent chandelier!...And my\r\ntwelfth-century Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran from one spot to another in wildest despair. He recalled the\r\npurchase price of each article, added up the figures, counted his\r\nlosses, pell-mell, in confused words and unfinished phrases. He stamped\r\nwith rage; he groaned with grief. He acted like a ruined man whose only\r\nhope is suicide.\r\n\r\nIf anything could have consoled him, it would have been the stupefaction\r\ndisplayed by Ganimard. The famous detective did not move. He appeared\r\nto be petrified; he examined the room in a listless manner. The\r\nwindows?.... closed. The locks on the doors?.... intact. Not a break in\r\nthe ceiling; not a hole in the floor. Everything was in perfect order.\r\nThe theft had been carried out methodically, according to a logical and\r\ninexorable plan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin....Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as if moved by anger, he rushed upon his two assistants and\r\nshook them violently. They did not awaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned over them and, in turn, examined them closely. They were\r\nasleep; but their response was unnatural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been drugged,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy him, of course, or his men under his discretion. That work bears his\r\nstamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, I am lost--nothing can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is dreadful; it is monstrous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLodge a complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good will that do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh; it is well to try it. The law has some resources.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law! Bah! it is useless. You represent the law, and, at this\r\nmoment, when you should be looking for a clue and trying to discover\r\nsomething, you do not even stir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscover something with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! Why, my dear monsieur, Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin never leaves any clue behind him. He leaves nothing to chance.\r\nSometimes I think he put himself in my way and simply allowed me to\r\narrest him in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I must renounce my pictures! He has taken the gems of my\r\ncollection. I would give a fortune to recover them. If there is no other\r\nway, let him name his own price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard regarded the baron attentively, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that is sensible. Will you stick to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. But why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn idea that I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will discuss it later--if the official examination does not succeed.\r\nBut, not one word about me, if you wish my assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe added, between his teeth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true I have nothing to boast of in this affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe assistants were gradually regaining consciousness with the\r\nbewildered air of people who come out of an hypnotic sleep. They opened\r\ntheir eyes and looked about them in astonishment. Ganimard questioned\r\nthem; they remembered nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must have seen some one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you drink anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey considered a moment, and then one of them replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I drank a little water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of that carafe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo did I,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the other.\r\n\r\nGanimard smelled and tasted it. It had no particular taste and no odor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are wasting our time here. One can\xe2\x80\x99t decide an\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin problem in five minutes. But, morbleau! I swear I will\r\ncatch him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same day, a charge of burglary was duly performed by Baron Cahorn\r\nagainst Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, a prisoner in the Prison de la Sant\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe baron afterwards regretted making the charge against Lupin when he\r\nsaw his castle delivered over to the gendarmes, the procureur, the judge\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99instruction, the newspaper reporters and photographers, and a throng\r\nof idle curiosity-seekers.\r\n\r\nThe affair soon became a topic of general discussion, and the name of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin excited the public imagination to such an extent that the\r\nnewspapers filled their columns with the most fantastic stories of his\r\nexploits which found ready credence amongst their readers.\r\n\r\nBut the letter of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin that was published in the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de\r\nFrance\xe2\x80\x99 (no once ever knew how the newspaper obtained it), that letter\r\nin which Baron Cahorn was impudently warned of the coming theft, caused\r\nconsiderable excitement. The most fabulous theories were advanced. Some\r\nrecalled the existence of the famous subterranean tunnels, and that was\r\nthe line of research pursued by the officers of the law, who searched\r\nthe house from top to bottom, questioned every stone, studied the\r\nwainscoting and the chimneys, the window-frames and the girders in the\r\nceilings. By the light of torches, they examined the immense cellars\r\nwhere the lords of Malaquis were wont to store their munitions and\r\nprovisions. They sounded the rocky foundation to its very centre. But it\r\nwas all in vain. They discovered no trace of a subterranean tunnel. No\r\nsecret passage existed.\r\n\r\nBut the eager public declared that the pictures and furniture could not\r\nvanish like so many ghosts. They are substantial, material things and\r\nrequire doors and windows for their exits and their entrances, and so\r\ndo the people that remove them. Who were those people? How did they gain\r\naccess to the castle? And how did they leave it?\r\n\r\nThe police officers of Rouen, convinced of their own impotence,\r\nsolicited the assistance of the Parisian detective force. Mon. Dudouis,\r\nchief of the S\xc3\xbbret\xc3\xa9, sent the best sleuths of the iron brigade. He\r\nhimself spent forty-eight hours at the castle, but met with no success.\r\nThen he sent for Ganimard, whose past services had proved so useful when\r\nall else failed.\r\n\r\nGanimard listened, in silence, to the instructions of his superior;\r\nthen, shaking his head, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, it is useless to ransack the castle. The solution of the\r\nproblem lies elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! To support that theory, we must admit his\r\nintervention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do admit it. In fact, I consider it quite certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Ganimard, that is absurd. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grant you that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is in prison, closely guarded; but he\r\nmust have fetters on his feet, manacles on his wrists, and gag in his\r\nmouth before I change my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so obstinate, Ganimard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is the only man in France of sufficient calibre to\r\ninvent and carry out a scheme of that magnitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMere words, Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut true ones. Look! What are they doing? Searching for subterranean\r\npassages, stones swinging on pivots, and other nonsense of that kind.\r\nBut Lupin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t employ such old-fashioned methods. He is a modern\r\ncracksman, right up to date.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how would you proceed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should ask your permission to spend an hour with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his cell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. During the return trip from America we became very friendly, and\r\nI venture to say that if he can give me any information without\r\ncompromising himself he will not hesitate to save me from incurring\r\nuseless trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after noon when Ganimard entered the cell of Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin. The latter, who was lying on his bed, raised his head and uttered\r\na cry of apparent joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! This is a real surprise. My dear Ganimard, here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my chosen retreat, I have felt a desire for many things, but my\r\nfondest wish was to receive you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery kind of you, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. You know I hold you in the highest regard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am proud of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always said: Ganimard is our best detective. He is almost,--you\r\nsee how candid I am!--he is almost as clever as Sherlock Holmes. But I\r\nam sorry that I cannot offer you anything better than this hard stool.\r\nAnd no refreshments! Not even a glass of beer! Of course, you will\r\nexcuse me, as I am here only temporarily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard smiled, and accepted the proffered seat. Then the prisoner\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, how pleased I am to see the face of an honest man. I am so\r\ntired of those devils of spies who come here ten times a day to ransack\r\nmy pockets and my cell to satisfy themselves that I am not preparing to\r\nescape. The government is very solicitous on my account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so? I should be quite contented if they would allow me to live in\r\nmy own quiet way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn other people\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so. That would be so simple. But here, I am joking, and you are,\r\nno doubt, in a hurry. So let us come to business, Ganimard. To what do I\r\nowe the honor of this visit?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cahorn affair,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Ganimard, frankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Wait, one moment. You see I have had so many affairs! First, let me\r\nfix in my mind the circumstances of this particular case....Ah! yes, now\r\nI have it. The Cahorn affair, Malaquis castle, Seine-Inf\xc3\xa9rieure....Two\r\nRubens, a Watteau, and a few trifling articles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrifling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! ma foi, all that is of slight importance. But it suffices to know\r\nthat the affair interests you. How can I serve you, Ganimard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I explain to you what steps the authorities have taken in the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I have read the newspapers and I will frankly state that\r\nyou have made very little progress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is the reason I have come to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am entirely at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, the Cahorn affair was managed by you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom A to Z.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter of warning? the telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll mine. I ought to have the receipts somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne opened the drawer of a small table of plain white wood which,\r\nwith the bed and stool, constituted all the furniture in his cell, and\r\ntook therefrom two scraps of paper which he handed to Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the detective, in surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cI though you were closely\r\nguarded and searched, and I find that you read the newspapers and\r\ncollect postal receipts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! these people are so stupid! They open the lining of my vest, they\r\nexamine the soles of my shoes, they sound the walls of my cell, but they\r\nnever imagine that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would be foolish enough to choose such a\r\nsimple hiding place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard laughed, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a droll fellow you are! Really, you bewilder me. But, come now,\r\ntell me about the Cahorn affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! not quite so fast! You would rob me of all my secrets; expose\r\nall my little tricks. That is a very serious matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas I wrong to count on your complaisance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Ganimard, and since you insist---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin paced his cell two or three times, then, stopping before\r\nGanimard, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of my letter to the baron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you were amusing yourself by playing to the gallery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! playing to the gallery! Come, Ganimard, I thought you knew me\r\nbetter. Do I, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, ever waste my time on such puerilities?\r\nWould I have written that letter if I could have robbed the baron\r\nwithout writing to him? I want you to understand that the letter was\r\nindispensable; it was the motor that set the whole machine in motion.\r\nNow, let us discuss together a scheme for the robbery of the Malaquis\r\ncastle. Are you willing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us suppose a castle carefully closed and barricaded like\r\nthat of the Baron Cahorn. Am I to abandon my scheme and renounce the\r\ntreasures that I covet, upon the pretext that the castle which holds\r\nthem is inaccessible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I make an assault upon the castle at the head of a band of\r\nadventurers as they did in ancient times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be foolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I gain admittance by stealth or cunning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is only one way open to me. I must have the owner of the\r\ncastle invite me to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is surely an original method.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how easy! Let us suppose that one day the owner receives a letter\r\nwarning him that a notorious burglar known as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is plotting\r\nto rob him. What will he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend a letter to the Procureur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will laugh at him, _because the said Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is actually in\r\nprison_. Then, in his anxiety and fear, the simple man will ask the\r\nassistance of the first-comer, will he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he happens to read in a country newspaper that a celebrated\r\ndetective is spending his vacation in a neighboring town---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will seek that detective.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. But, on the other hand, let us presume that, having foreseen\r\nthat state of affairs, the said Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has requested one of his\r\nfriends to visit Caudebec, make the acquaintance of the editor of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98R\xc3\xa9veil,\xe2\x80\x99 a newspaper to which the baron is a subscriber, and let said\r\neditor understand that such person is the celebrated detective--then,\r\nwhat will happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe editor will announce in the \xe2\x80\x98R\xc3\xa9veil\xe2\x80\x99 the presence in Caudebec of\r\nsaid detective.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; and one of two things will happen: either the fish--I mean\r\nCahorn--will not bite, and nothing will happen; or, what is more likely,\r\nhe will run and greedily swallow the bait. Thus, behold my Baron Cahorn\r\nimploring the assistance of one of my friends against me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOriginal, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the pseudo-detective at first refuses to give any\r\nassistance. On top of that comes the telegram from Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. The\r\nfrightened baron rushes once more to my friend and offers him a definite\r\nsum of money for his services. My friend accepts and summons two members\r\nof our band, who, during the night, whilst Cahorn is under the watchful\r\neye of his protector, removes certain articles by way of the window\r\nand lowers them with ropes into a nice little launch chartered for the\r\noccasion. Simple, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous! Marvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ganimard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boldness of the scheme\r\nand the ingenuity of all its details are beyond criticism. But who is\r\nthe detective whose name and fame served as a magnet to attract the\r\nbaron and draw him into your net?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one name could do it--only one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s personal enemy--the most illustrious Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYourself, Ganimard. And, really, it is very funny. If you go there, and\r\nthe baron decides to talk, you will find that it will be your duty to\r\narrest yourself, just as you arrested me in America. Hein! the revenge\r\nis really amusing: I cause Ganimard to arrest Ganimard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin laughed heartily. The detective, greatly vexed, bit his\r\nlips; to him the joke was quite devoid of humor. The arrival of a prison\r\nguard gave Ganimard an opportunity to recover himself. The man brought\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s luncheon, furnished by a neighboring restaurant. After\r\ndepositing the tray upon the table, the guard retired. Lupin broke his\r\nbread, ate a few morsels, and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, rest easy, my dear Ganimard, you will not go to Malaquis. I can\r\ntell you something that will astonish you: the Cahorn affair is on the\r\npoint of being settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me; I have just seen the Chief of the Suret\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of that? Does Mon. Dudouis know my business better than I\r\ndo myself? You will learn that Ganimard--excuse me--that the\r\npseudo-Ganimard still remains on very good terms with the baron. The\r\nlatter has authorized him to negotiate a very delicate transaction with\r\nme, and, at the present moment, in consideration of a certain sum, it\r\nis probable that the baron has recovered possession of his pictures and\r\nother treasures. And on their return, he will withdraw his complaint.\r\nThus, there is no longer any theft, and the law must abandon the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard regarded the prisoner with a bewildered air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you know all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just received the telegram I was expecting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have just received a telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis very moment, my dear friend. Out of politeness, I did not wish to\r\nread it in your presence. But if you will permit me---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are joking, Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, if you will be so kind as to break that egg, you will\r\nlearn for yourself that I am not joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMechanically, Ganimard obeyed, and cracked the egg-shell with the blade\r\nof a knife. He uttered a cry of surprise. The shell contained nothing\r\nbut a small piece of blue paper. At the request of Ars\xc3\xa8ne he unfolded\r\nit. It was a telegram, or rather a portion of a telegram from which the\r\npost-marks had been removed. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContract closed. Hundred thousand balls delivered. All well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred thousand balls?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one hundred thousand francs. Very little, but then, you know,\r\nthese are hard times....And I have some heavy bills to meet. If you only\r\nknew my budget.... living in the city comes very high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard arose. His ill humor had disappeared. He reflected for a\r\nmoment, glancing over the whole affair in an effort to discover a weak\r\npoint; then, in a tone and manner that betrayed his admiration of the\r\nprisoner, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, we do not have a dozen such as you to deal with; if we\r\ndid, we would have to close up shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin assumed a modest air, as he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! a person must have some diversion to occupy his leisure hours,\r\nespecially when he is in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cyour trial, your defense, the\r\nexamination--isn\xe2\x80\x99t that sufficient to occupy your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because I have decided not to be present at my trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin repeated, positively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be present at my trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear monsieur, do you suppose I am going to rot upon the wet\r\nstraw? You insult me. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin remains in prison just as long as it\r\npleases him, and not one minute more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would have been more prudent if you had avoided getting\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the detective, ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! monsieur jests? Monsieur must remember that he had the honor to\r\neffect my arrest. Know then, my worthy friend, that no one, not even\r\nyou, could have placed a hand upon me if a much more important event had\r\nnot occupied my attention at that critical moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou astonish me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman was looking at me, Ganimard, and I loved her. Do you fully\r\nunderstand what that means: to be under the eyes of a woman that one\r\nloves? I cared for nothing in the world but that. And that is why I am\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to say: you have been here a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, I wished to forget. Do not laugh; it was a\r\ndelightful adventure and it is still a tender memory. Besides, I have\r\nbeen suffering from neurasthenia. Life is so feverish these days that it\r\nis necessary to take the \xe2\x80\x98rest cure\xe2\x80\x99 occasionally, and I find this spot\r\na sovereign remedy for my tired nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, you are not a bad fellow, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin. \xe2\x80\x9cGanimard, this is Friday. On Wednesday next,\r\nat four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, I will smoke my cigar at your house in\r\nthe rue Pergolese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, I will expect you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shook hands like two old friends who valued each other at their\r\ntrue worth; then the detective stepped to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGanimard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ganimard, as he turned back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have forgotten your watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy watch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it strayed into my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned the watch, excusing himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me.... a bad habit. Because they have taken mine is no reason why\r\nI should take yours. Besides, I have a chronometer here that satisfies\r\nme fairly well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took from the drawer a large gold watch and heavy chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whose pocket did that come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ganimard.\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin gave a hasty glance at the initials engraved on the watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJ.B.....Who the devil can that be?....Ah! yes, I remember. Jules\r\nBouvier, the judge who conducted my examination. A charming fellow!....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Escape of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\n\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had just finished his repast and taken from his pocket an\r\nexcellent cigar, with a gold band, which he was examining with unusual\r\ncare, when the door of his cell was opened. He had barely time to\r\nthrow the cigar into the drawer and move away from the table. The guard\r\nentered. It was the hour for exercise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was waiting for you, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lupin, in his accustomed\r\ngood humor.\r\n\r\nThey went out together. As soon as they had disappeared at a turn in the\r\ncorridor, two men entered the cell and commenced a minute examination\r\nof it. One was Inspector Dieuzy; the other was Inspector Folenfant. They\r\nwished to verify their suspicion that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was in communication\r\nwith his accomplices outside of the prison. On the preceding evening,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Grand Journal\xe2\x80\x99 had published these lines addressed to its court\r\nreporter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a recent article you referred to me in most unjustifiable\r\nterms. Some days before the opening of my trial I will call you to\r\naccount. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe handwriting was certainly that of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Consequently, he\r\nsent letters; and, no doubt, received letters. It was certain that he\r\nwas preparing for that escape thus arrogantly announced by him.\r\n\r\nThe situation had become intolerable. Acting in conjunction with the\r\nexamining judge, the chief of the S\xc3\xbbret\xc3\xa9, Mon. Dudouis, had visited the\r\nprison and instructed the gaoler in regard to the precautions necessary\r\nto insure Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s safety. At the same time, he sent the two men to\r\nexamine the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s cell. They raised every stone, ransacked the bed,\r\ndid everything customary in such a case, but they discovered nothing,\r\nand were about to abandon their investigation when the guard entered\r\nhastily and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe drawer.... look in the table-drawer. When I entered just now he was\r\nclosing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey opened the drawer, and Dieuzy exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! we have him this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFolenfant stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment. The chief will want to make an inventory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very choice cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it there, and notify the chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Mon. Dudouis examined the contents of the drawer.\r\nFirst he discovered a bundle of newspaper clippings relating to Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin taken from the \xe2\x80\x98Argus de la Presse,\xe2\x80\x99 then a tobacco-box, a pipe,\r\nsome paper called \xe2\x80\x9conion-peel,\xe2\x80\x9d and two books. He read the titles of the\r\nbooks. One was an English edition of Carlyle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHero-worship\xe2\x80\x9d; the other\r\nwas a charming elzevir, in modern binding, the \xe2\x80\x9cManual of Epictetus,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nGerman translation published at Leyden in 1634. On examining the books,\r\nhe found that all the pages were underlined and annotated. Were they\r\nprepared as a code for correspondence, or did they simply express the\r\nstudious character of the reader? Then he examined the tobacco-box and\r\nthe pipe. Finally, he took up the famous cigar with its gold band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFichtre!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cOur friend smokes a good cigar. It\xe2\x80\x99s a Henry\r\nClay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the mechanical action of an habitual smoker, he placed the cigar\r\nclose to his ear and squeezed it to make it crack. Immediately he\r\nuttered a cry of surprise. The cigar had yielded under the pressure\r\nof his fingers. He examined it more closely, and quickly discovered\r\nsomething white between the leaves of tobacco. Delicately, with the aid\r\nof a pin, he withdrew a roll of very thin paper, scarcely larger than\r\na toothpick. It was a letter. He unrolled it, and found these words,\r\nwritten in a feminine handwriting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe basket has taken the place of the others. Eight out of ten are\r\nready. On pressing the outer foot the plate goes downward. From twelve\r\nto sixteen every day, H-P will wait. But where? Reply at once. Rest\r\neasy; your friend is watching over you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Dudouis reflected a moment, then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite clear.... the basket.... the eight compartments.... From\r\ntwelve to sixteen means from twelve to four o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this H-P, that will wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH-P must mean automobile. H-P, horsepower, is the way they indicate\r\nstrength of the motor. A twenty-four H-P is an automobile of twenty-four\r\nhorsepower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he rose, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad the prisoner finished his breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as he has not yet read the message, which is proved by the\r\ncondition of the cigar, it is probable that he had just received it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his food. Concealed in his bread or in a potato, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible. His food was allowed to be brought in simply to trap him,\r\nbut we have never found anything in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will look for Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s reply this evening. Detain him outside for a\r\nfew minutes. I shall take this to the examining judge, and, if he agrees\r\nwith me, we will have the letter photographed at once, and in an hour\r\nyou can replace the letter in the drawer in a cigar similar to this. The\r\nprisoner must have no cause for suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not without a certain curiosity that Mon. Dudouis returned to\r\nthe prison in the evening, accompanied by Inspector Dieuzy. Three empty\r\nplates were sitting on the stove in the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has eaten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDieuzy, please cut that macaroni into very small pieces, and open that\r\nbread-roll....Nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Dudouis examined the plates, the fork, the spoon, and the knife--an\r\nordinary knife with a rounded blade. He turned the handle to the left;\r\nthen to the right. It yielded and unscrewed. The knife was hollow, and\r\nserved as a hiding-place for a sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeuh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is not very clever for a man like Ars\xc3\xa8ne. But we\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t lose any time. You, Dieuzy, go and search the restaurant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he read the note:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust to you, H-P will follow at a distance every day. I will go\r\nahead. Au revoir, dear friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mon. Dudouis, rubbing his hands gleefully, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\r\nhave the affair in our own hands. A little strategy on our part, and the\r\nescape will be a success in so far as the arrest of his confederates are\r\nconcerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin slips through your fingers?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will have a sufficient number of men to prevent that. If, however,\r\nhe displays too much cleverness, ma foi, so much the worse for him! As\r\nto his band of robbers, since the chief refuses to speak, the others\r\nmust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAnd, as a matter of fact, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had very little to say. For\r\nseveral months, Mon. Jules Bouvier, the examining judge, had\r\nexerted himself in vain. The investigation had been reduced to a few\r\nuninteresting arguments between the judge and the advocate, Ma\xc3\xaetre\r\nDanval, one of the leaders of the bar. From time to time, through\r\ncourtesy, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would speak. One day he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, le judge, I quite agree with you: the robbery of the\r\nCr\xc3\xa9dit Lyonnais, the theft in the rue de Babylone, the issue of\r\nthe counterfeit bank-notes, the burglaries at the various ch\xc3\xa2teaux,\r\nArmesnil, Gouret, Imblevain, Groseillers, Malaquis, all my work,\r\nmonsieur, I did it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will you explain to me---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless. I confess everything in a lump, everything and even ten\r\ntimes more than you know nothing about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWearied by his fruitless task, the judge had suspended his examinations,\r\nbut he resumed them after the two intercepted messages were brought to\r\nhis attention; and regularly, at mid-day, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was taken from\r\nthe prison to the D\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t in the prison-van with a certain number of other\r\nprisoners. They returned about three or four o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nNow, one afternoon, this return trip was made under unusual conditions.\r\nThe other prisoners not having been examined, it was decided to take\r\nback Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin first, thus he found himself alone in the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThese prison-vans, vulgarly called \xe2\x80\x9cpanniers \xc3\xa0 salade\xe2\x80\x9d--or\r\nsalad-baskets--are divided lengthwise by a central corridor from which\r\nopen ten compartments, five on either side. Each compartment is so\r\narranged that the occupant must assume and retain a sitting posture,\r\nand, consequently, the five prisoners are seated one upon the other,\r\nand yet separated one from the other by partitions. A municipal guard,\r\nstanding at one end, watches over the corridor.\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne was placed in the third cell on the right, and the heavy vehicle\r\nstarted. He carefully calculated when they left the quai de l\xe2\x80\x99Horloge,\r\nand when they passed the Palais de Justice. Then, about the centre of\r\nthe bridge Saint Michel, with his outer foot, that is to say, his right\r\nfoot, he pressed upon the metal plate that closed his cell. Immediately\r\nsomething clicked, and the metal plate moved. He was able to ascertain\r\nthat he was located between the two wheels.\r\n\r\nHe waited, keeping a sharp look-out. The vehicle was proceeding slowly\r\nalong the boulevard Saint Michel. At the corner of Saint Germain it\r\nstopped. A truck horse had fallen. The traffic having been interrupted,\r\na vast throng of fiacres and omnibuses had gathered there. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nlooked out. Another prison-van had stopped close to the one he occupied.\r\nHe moved the plate still farther, put his foot on one of the spokes\r\nof the wheel and leaped to the ground. A coachman saw him, roared with\r\nlaughter, then tried to raise an outcry, but his voice was lost in the\r\nnoise of the traffic that had commenced to move again. Moreover, Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin was already far away.\r\n\r\nHe had run for a few steps; but, once upon the sidewalk, he turned\r\nand looked around; he seemed to scent the wind like a person who is\r\nuncertain which direction to take. Then, having decided, he put his\r\nhands in his pockets, and, with the careless air of an idle stroller,\r\nhe proceeded up the boulevard. It was a warm, bright autumn day, and\r\nthe caf\xc3\xa9s were full. He took a seat on the terrace of one of them. He\r\nordered a bock and a package of cigarettes. He emptied his glass slowly,\r\nsmoked one cigarette and lighted a second. Then he asked the waiter to\r\nsend the proprietor to him. When the proprietor came, Ars\xc3\xa8ne spoke to\r\nhim in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI regret to say, monsieur, I have forgotten my pocketbook. Perhaps, on\r\nthe strength of my name, you will be pleased to give me credit for a few\r\ndays. I am Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proprietor looked at him, thinking he was joking. But Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin, prisoner at the Sant\xc3\xa9, but now a fugitive. I venture to assume\r\nthat the name inspires you with perfect confidence in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he walked away, amidst shouts of laughter, whilst the proprietor\r\nstood amazed.\r\n\r\nLupin strolled along the rue Soufflot, and turned into the rue Saint\r\nJacques. He pursued his way slowly, smoking his cigarettes and looking\r\ninto the shop-windows. At the Boulevard de Port Royal he took his\r\nbearings, discovered where he was, and then walked in the direction of\r\nthe rue de la Sant\xc3\xa9. The high forbidding walls of the prison were\r\nnow before him. He pulled his hat forward to shade his face; then,\r\napproaching the sentinel, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the prison de la Sant\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to regain my cell. The van left me on the way, and I would not\r\nabuse--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, young man, move along--quick!\xe2\x80\x9d growled the sentinel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, but I must pass through that gate. And if you prevent Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin from entering the prison it will cost you dear, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! What are you talking about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a card with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ars\xc3\xa8ne, fumbling in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nThe sentinel eyed him from head to foot, in astonishment. Then, without\r\na word, he rang a bell. The iron gate was partly opened, and Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nstepped inside. Almost immediately he encountered the keeper of the\r\nprison, gesticulating and feigning a violent anger. Ars\xc3\xa8ne smiled and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, monsieur, don\xe2\x80\x99t play that game with me. What! they take\r\nthe precaution to carry me alone in the van, prepare a nice little\r\nobstruction, and imagine I am going to take to my heels and rejoin\r\nmy friends. Well, and what about the twenty agents of the S\xc3\xbbret\xc3\xa9 who\r\naccompanied us on foot, in fiacres and on bicycles? No, the arrangement\r\ndid not please me. I should not have got away alive. Tell me, monsieur,\r\ndid they count on that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you, monsieur, not to worry about me. When I wish to escape I\r\nshall not require any assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the second day thereafter, the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France,\xe2\x80\x99 which had apparently\r\nbecome the official reporter of the exploits of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,--it was\r\nsaid that he was one of its principal shareholders--published a most\r\ncomplete account of this attempted escape. The exact wording of the\r\nmessages exchanged between the prisoner and his mysterious friend, the\r\nmeans by which correspondence was constructed, the complicity of the\r\npolice, the promenade on the Boulevard Saint Michel, the incident at the\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9 Soufflot, everything was disclosed. It was known that the search of\r\nthe restaurant and its waiters by Inspector Dieuzy had been fruitless.\r\nAnd the public also learned an extraordinary thing which demonstrated\r\nthe infinite variety of resources that Lupin possessed: the prison-van,\r\nin which he was being carried, was prepared for the occasion and\r\nsubstituted by his accomplices for one of the six vans which did service\r\nat the prison.\r\n\r\nThe next escape of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was not doubted by anyone. He announced\r\nit himself, in categorical terms, in a reply to Mon. Bouvier on the day\r\nfollowing his attempted escape. The judge having made a jest about\r\nthe affair, Ars\xc3\xa8ne was annoyed, and, firmly eyeing the judge, he said,\r\nemphatically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, monsieur! I give you my word of honor that this attempted\r\nflight was simply preliminary to my general plan of escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not necessary that you should understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when the judge, in the course of that examination which was reported\r\nat length in the columns of the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France,\xe2\x80\x99 when the judge sought\r\nto resume his investigation, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin exclaimed, with an assumed air\r\nof lassitude:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, Mon Dieu, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use! All these questions are of no\r\nimportance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! No importance?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; because I shall not be present at the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be present?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have fully decided on that, and nothing will change my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch assurance combined with the inexplicable indiscretions that Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\ncommitted every day served to annoy and mystify the officers of the law.\r\nThere were secrets known only to Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin; secrets that he alone\r\ncould divulge. But for what purpose did he reveal them? And how?\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was changed to another cell. The judge closed his\r\npreliminary investigation. No further proceedings were taken in his case\r\nfor a period of two months, during which time Ars\xc3\xa8ne was seen almost\r\nconstantly lying on his bed with his face turned toward the wall. The\r\nchanging of his cell seemed to discourage him. He refused to see his\r\nadvocate. He exchanged only a few necessary words with his keepers.\r\n\r\nDuring the fortnight preceding his trial, he resumed his vigorous life.\r\nHe complained of want of air. Consequently, early every morning he was\r\nallowed to exercise in the courtyard, guarded by two men.\r\n\r\nPublic curiosity had not died out; every day it expected to be regaled\r\nwith news of his escape; and, it is true, he had gained a considerable\r\namount of public sympathy by reason of his verve, his gayety, his\r\ndiversity, his inventive genius and the mystery of his life. Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin must escape. It was his inevitable fate. The public expected it,\r\nand was surprised that the event had been delayed so long. Every morning\r\nthe Pr\xc3\xa9fect of Police asked his secretary:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, has he escaped yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Monsieur le Pr\xc3\xa9fect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, probably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, on the day before the trial, a gentleman called at the office of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Grand Journal,\xe2\x80\x99 asked to see the court reporter, threw his card in\r\nthe reporter\xe2\x80\x99s face, and walked rapidly away. These words were written\r\non the card: \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin always keeps his promises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions that the trial commenced. An enormous\r\ncrowd gathered at the court. Everybody wished to see the famous Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin. They had a gleeful anticipation that the prisoner would play some\r\naudacious pranks upon the judge. Advocates and magistrates, reporters\r\nand men of the world, actresses and society women were crowded together\r\non the benches provided for the public.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark, sombre day, with a steady downpour of rain. Only a\r\ndim light pervaded the courtroom, and the spectators caught a very\r\nindistinct view of the prisoner when the guards brought him in. But his\r\nheavy, shambling walk, the manner in which he dropped into his seat, and\r\nhis passive, stupid appearance were not at all prepossessing. Several\r\ntimes his advocate--one of Mon. Danval\xe2\x80\x99s assistants--spoke to him, but\r\nhe simply shook his head and said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe clerk read the indictment, then the judge spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrisoner at the bar, stand up. Your name, age, and occupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot receiving any reply, the judge repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name? I ask you your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thick, slow voice muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaudru, D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur of surprise pervaded the courtroom. But the judge proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaudru, D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9? Ah! a new alias! Well, as you have already assumed a\r\ndozen different names and this one is, no doubt, as imaginary as the\r\nothers, we will adhere to the name of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, by which you are\r\nmore generally known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge referred to his notes, and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor, despite the most diligent search, your past history remains\r\nunknown. Your case is unique in the annals of crime. We know not whom\r\nyou are, whence you came, your birth and breeding--all is a mystery\r\nto us. Three years ago you appeared in our midst as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\r\npresenting to us a strange combination of intelligence and perversion,\r\nimmorality and generosity. Our knowledge of your life prior to that date\r\nis vague and problematical. It may be that the man called Rostat who,\r\neight years ago, worked with Dickson, the prestidigitator, was none\r\nother than Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. It is probable that the Russian student who,\r\nsix years ago, attended the laboratory of Doctor Altier at the Saint\r\nLouis Hospital, and who often astonished the doctor by the ingenuity\r\nof his hypotheses on subjects of bacteriology and the boldness of his\r\nexperiments in diseases of the skin, was none other than Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\nIt is probable, also, that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was the professor who introduced\r\nthe Japanese art of jiu-jitsu to the Parisian public. We have some\r\nreason to believe that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was the bicyclist who won the Grand\r\nPrix de l\xe2\x80\x99Exposition, received his ten thousand francs, and was never\r\nheard of again. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin may have been, also, the person who saved\r\nso many lives through the little dormer-window at the Charity Bazaar;\r\nand, at the same time, picked their pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge paused for a moment, then continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is that epoch which seems to have been utilized by you in a\r\nthorough preparation for the warfare you have since waged against\r\nsociety; a methodical apprenticeship in which you developed your\r\nstrength, energy and skill to the highest point possible. Do you\r\nacknowledge the accuracy of these facts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this discourse the prisoner had stood balancing himself, first\r\non one foot, then on the other, with shoulders stooped and arms inert.\r\nUnder the strongest light one could observe his extreme thinness, his\r\nhollow cheeks, his projecting cheek-bones, his earthen-colored face\r\ndotted with small red spots and framed in a rough, straggling beard.\r\nPrison life had caused him to age and wither. He had lost the\r\nyouthful face and elegant figure we had seen portrayed so often in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nIt appeared as if he had not heard the question propounded by the\r\njudge. Twice it was repeated to him. Then he raised his eyes, seemed to\r\nreflect, then, making a desperate effort, he murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaudru, D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe judge smiled, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand the theory of your defense, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. If you\r\nare seeking to avoid responsibility for your crimes on the ground of\r\nimbecility, such a line of defense is open to you. But I shall proceed\r\nwith the trial and pay no heed to your vagaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then narrated at length the various thefts, swindles and forgeries\r\ncharged against Lupin. Sometimes he questioned the prisoner, but the\r\nlatter simply grunted or remained silent. The examination of witnesses\r\ncommenced. Some of the evidence given was immaterial; other portions\r\nof it seemed more important, but through all of it there ran a vein of\r\ncontradictions and inconsistencies. A wearisome obscurity enveloped\r\nthe proceedings, until Detective Ganimard was called as a witness; then\r\ninterest was revived.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the actions of the veteran detective appeared strange\r\nand unaccountable. He was nervous and ill at ease. Several times he\r\nlooked at the prisoner, with obvious doubt and anxiety. Then, with his\r\nhands resting on the rail in front of him, he recounted the events in\r\nwhich he had participated, including his pursuit of the prisoner\r\nacross Europe and his arrival in America. He was listened to with great\r\navidity, as his capture of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was well known to everyone\r\nthrough the medium of the press. Toward the close of his testimony,\r\nafter referring to his conversations with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, he stopped,\r\ntwice, embarrassed and undecided. It was apparent that he was possessed\r\nof some thought which he feared to utter. The judge said to him,\r\nsympathetically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are ill, you may retire for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, but---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, looked sharply at the prisoner, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask permission to scrutinize the prisoner at closer range. There is\r\nsome mystery about him that I must solve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe approached the accused man, examined him attentively for several\r\nminutes, then returned to the witness-stand, and, in an almost solemn\r\nvoice, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, on oath, that the prisoner now before me is not Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA profound silence followed the statement. The judge, nonplused for a\r\nmoment, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! What do you mean? That is absurd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe detective continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first sight there is a certain resemblance, but if you carefully\r\nconsider the nose, the mouth, the hair, the color of skin, you will\r\nsee that it is not Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. And the eyes! Did he ever have those\r\nalcoholic eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, witness! What do you mean? Do you pretend to say that we\r\nare trying the wrong man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, yes. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has, in some manner, contrived to put\r\nthis poor devil in his place, unless this man is a willing accomplice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis dramatic d\xc3\xa9nouement caused much laughter and excitement amongst the\r\nspectators. The judge adjourned the trial, and sent for Mon. Bouvier,\r\nthe gaoler, and guards employed in the prison.\r\n\r\nWhen the trial was resumed, Mon. Bouvier and the gaoler examined the\r\naccused and declared that there was only a very slight resemblance\r\nbetween the prisoner and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the judge, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is this man? Where does he come\r\nfrom? What is he in prison for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo of the prison-guards were called and both of them declared that the\r\nprisoner was Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. The judged breathed once more.\r\n\r\nBut one of the guards then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I think it is he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the judge, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou *think* it is he! What do you\r\nmean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I saw very little of the prisoner. He was placed in my charge in\r\nthe evening and, for two months, he seldom stirred, but laid on his bed\r\nwith his face to the wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the time prior to those two months?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore that he occupied a cell in another part of the prison. He was\r\nnot in cell 24.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the head gaoler interrupted, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe changed him to another cell after his attempted escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, monsieur, you have seen him during those two months?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no occasion to see him. He was always quiet and orderly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this prisoner is not Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we have before us a man who was substituted for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, two\r\nmonths ago. How do you explain that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn absolute despair, the judge turned to the accused and addressed him\r\nin a conciliatory tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrisoner, can you tell me how, and since when, you became an inmate of\r\nthe Prison de la Sant\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe engaging manner of the judge was calculated to disarm the mistrust\r\nand awaken the understanding of the accused man. He tried to reply.\r\nFinally, under clever and gentle questioning, he succeeded in framing a\r\nfew phrases from which the following story was gleaned: Two months ago\r\nhe had been taken to the D\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t, examined and released. As he was leaving\r\nthe building, a free man, he was seized by two guards and placed in the\r\nprison-van. Since then he had occupied cell 24. He was contented there,\r\nplenty to eat, and he slept well--so he did not complain.\r\n\r\nAll that seemed probable; and, amidst the mirth and excitement of the\r\nspectators, the judge adjourned the trial until the story could be\r\ninvestigated and verified.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe following facts were at once established by an examination of the\r\nprison records: Eight weeks before a man named Baudru D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9 had slept\r\nat the D\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t. He was released the next day, and left the D\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t at two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon. On the same day at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, having been\r\nexamined for the last time, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin left the D\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t in a prison-van.\r\n\r\nHad the guards made a mistake? Had they been deceived by the resemblance\r\nand carelessly substituted this man for their prisoner?\r\n\r\nAnother question suggested itself: Had the substitution been arranged in\r\nadvance? In that event Baudru must have been an accomplice and must have\r\ncaused his own arrest for the express purpose of taking Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace. But then, by what miracle had such a plan, based on a series of\r\nimprobable chances, been carried to success?\r\n\r\nBaudru D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9 was turned over to the anthropological service; they\r\nhad never seen anything like him. However, they easily traced his past\r\nhistory. He was known at Courbevois, at Asni\xc3\xa8res and at Levallois.\r\nHe lived on alms and slept in one of those rag-picker\xe2\x80\x99s huts near the\r\nbarrier de Ternes. He had disappeared from there a year ago.\r\n\r\nHad he been enticed away by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin? There was no evidence to that\r\neffect. And even if that was so, it did not explain the flight of the\r\nprisoner. That still remained a mystery. Amongst twenty theories which\r\nsought to explain it, not one was satisfactory. Of the escape itself,\r\nthere was no doubt; an escape that was incomprehensible, sensational,\r\nin which the public, as well as the officers of the law, could detect\r\na carefully prepared plan, a combination of circumstances marvelously\r\ndove-tailed, whereof the d\xc3\xa9nouement fully justified the confident\r\nprediction of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be present at my trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a month of patient investigation, the problem remained unsolved.\r\nThe poor devil of a Baudru could not be kept in prison indefinitely, and\r\nto place him on trial would be ridiculous. There was no charge against\r\nhim. Consequently, he was released; but the chief of the S\xc3\xbbr\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 resolved\r\nto keep him under surveillance. This idea originated with Ganimard. From\r\nhis point of view there was neither complicity nor chance. Baudru was\r\nan instrument upon which Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had played with his extraordinary\r\nskill. Baudru, when set at liberty, would lead them to Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin or,\r\nat least, to some of his accomplices. The two inspectors, Folenfant and\r\nDieuzy, were assigned to assist Ganimard.\r\n\r\nOne foggy morning in January the prison gates opened and Baudru D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9\r\nstepped forth--a free man. At first he appeared to be quite embarrassed,\r\nand walked like a person who has no precise idea whither he is going.\r\nHe followed the rue de la Sant\xc3\xa9 and the rue Saint Jacques. He stopped in\r\nfront of an old-clothes shop, removed his jacket and his vest, sold his\r\nvest on which he realized a few sous; then, replacing his jacket, he\r\nproceeded on his way. He crossed the Seine. At the Ch\xc3\xa2telet an\r\nomnibus passed him. He wished to enter it, but there was no place.\r\nThe controller advised him to secure a number, so he entered the\r\nwaiting-room.\r\n\r\nGanimard called to his two assistants, and, without removing his eyes\r\nfrom the waiting room, he said to them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a carriage.... no, two. That will be better. I will go with one of\r\nyou, and we will follow him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed. Yet Baudru did not appear. Ganimard entered the\r\nwaiting-room. It was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdiot that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot there was another exit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an interior corridor extending from the waiting-room to the\r\nrue Saint Martin. Ganimard rushed through it and arrived just in time to\r\nobserve Baudru upon the top of the Batignolles-Jardin de Plates omnibus\r\nas it was turning the corner of the rue de Rivoli. He ran and caught\r\nthe omnibus. But he had lost his two assistants. He must continue the\r\npursuit alone. In his anger he was inclined to seize the man by the\r\ncollar without ceremony. Was it not with premeditation and by means of\r\nan ingenious ruse that his pretended imbecile had separated him from his\r\nassistants?\r\n\r\nHe looked at Baudru. The latter was asleep on the bench, his head\r\nrolling from side to side, his mouth half-opened, and an incredible\r\nexpression of stupidity on his blotched face. No, such an adversary was\r\nincapable of deceiving old Ganimard. It was a stroke of luck--nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAt the Galleries-Lafayette, the man leaped from the omnibus and took\r\nthe La Muette tramway, following the boulevard Haussmann and the\r\navenue Victor Hugo. Baudru alighted at La Muette station; and, with a\r\nnonchalant air, strolled into the Bois de Boulogne.\r\n\r\nHe wandered through one path after another, and sometimes retraced his\r\nsteps. What was he seeking? Had he any definite object? At the end of\r\nan hour, he appeared to be faint from fatigue, and, noticing a bench, he\r\nsat down. The spot, not far from Auteuil, on the edge of a pond hidden\r\namongst the trees, was absolutely deserted. After the lapse of another\r\nhalf-hour, Ganimard became impatient and resolved to speak to the man.\r\nHe approached and took a seat beside Baudru, lighted a cigarette, traced\r\nsome figures in the sand with the end of his cane, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasant day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo response. But, suddenly the man burst into laughter, a happy,\r\nmirthful laugh, spontaneous and irresistible. Ganimard felt his hair\r\nstand on end in horror and surprise. It was that laugh, that infernal\r\nlaugh he knew so well!\r\n\r\nWith a sudden movement, he seized the man by the collar and looked at\r\nhim with a keen, penetrating gaze; and found that he no longer saw the\r\nman Baudru. To be sure, he saw Baudru; but, at the same time, he saw the\r\nother, the real man, Lupin. He discovered the intense life in the eyes,\r\nhe filled up the shrunken features, he perceived the real flesh beneath\r\nthe flabby skin, the real mouth through the grimaces that deformed it.\r\nThose were the eyes and mouth of the other, and especially his keen,\r\nalert, mocking expression, so clear and youthful!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\nThen, in a sudden fit of rage, he seized Lupin by the throat and tried\r\nto hold him down. In spite of his fifty years, he still possessed\r\nunusual strength, whilst his adversary was apparently in a weak\r\ncondition. But the struggle was a brief one. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin made only a\r\nslight movement, and, as suddenly as he had made the attack, Ganimard\r\nreleased his hold. His right arm fell inert, useless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had taken lessons in jiu-jitsu at the quai des Orf\xc3\xa8vres,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLupin, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would know that that blow is called udi-shi-ghi in Japanese.\r\nA second more, and I would have broken your arm and that would have been\r\njust what you deserve. I am surprised that you, an old friend whom I\r\nrespect and before whom I voluntarily expose my incognito, should abuse\r\nmy confidence in that violent manner. It is unworthy--Ah! What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard did not reply. That escape for which he deemed himself\r\nresponsible--was it not he, Ganimard, who, by his sensational evidence,\r\nhad led the court into serious error? That escape appeared to him like\r\na dark cloud on his professional career. A tear rolled down his cheek to\r\nhis gray moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! mon Dieu, Ganimard, don\xe2\x80\x99t take it to heart. If you had not spoken,\r\nI would have arranged for some one else to do it. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow poor\r\nBaudru D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9 to be convicted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Ganimard, \xe2\x80\x9cit was you that was there? And now you are\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I, always I, only I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is not the work of a sorcerer. Simply, as the judge remarked at\r\nthe trial, the apprenticeship of a dozen years that equips a man to cope\r\nsuccessfully with all the obstacles in life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your face? Your eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can understand that if I worked eighteen months with Doctor Altier\r\nat the Saint-Louis hospital, it was not out of love for the work. I\r\nconsidered that he, who would one day have the honor of calling himself\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, ought to be exempt from the ordinary laws governing\r\nappearance and identity. Appearance? That can be modified at will. For\r\ninstance, a hypodermic injection of paraffine will puff up the skin at\r\nthe desired spot. Pyrogallic acid will change your skin to that of an\r\nIndian. The juice of the greater celandine will adorn you with the most\r\nbeautiful eruptions and tumors. Another chemical affects the growth of\r\nyour beard and hair; another changes the tone of your voice. Add to that\r\ntwo months of dieting in cell 24; exercises repeated a thousand times to\r\nenable me to hold my features in a certain grimace, to carry my head\r\nat a certain inclination, and adapt my back and shoulders to a stooping\r\nposture. Then five drops of atropine in the eyes to make them haggard\r\nand wild, and the trick is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand how you deceived the guards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe change was progressive. The evolution was so gradual that they\r\nfailed to notice it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Baudru D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaudru exists. He is a poor, harmless fellow whom\r\nI met last year; and, really, he bears a certain resemblance to me.\r\nConsidering my arrest as a possible event, I took charge of Baudru and\r\nstudied the points wherein we differed in appearance with a view to\r\ncorrect them in my own person. My friends caused him to remain at the\r\nD\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t overnight, and to leave there next day about the same hour as I\r\ndid--a coincidence easily arranged. Of course, it was necessary to have\r\na record of his detention at the D\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4t in order to establish the fact\r\nthat such a person was a reality; otherwise, the police would have\r\nsought elsewhere to find out my identity. But, in offering to them this\r\nexcellent Baudru, it was inevitable, you understand, inevitable that\r\nthey would seize upon him, and, despite the insurmountable difficulties\r\nof a substitution, they would prefer to believe in a substitution than\r\nconfess their ignorance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cI held in my hands a trump-card: an\r\nanxious public watching and waiting for my escape. And that is the fatal\r\nerror into which you fell, you and the others, in the course of that\r\nfascinating game pending between me and the officers of the law wherein\r\nthe stake was my liberty. And you supposed that I was playing to the\r\ngallery; that I was intoxicated with my success. I, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, guilty\r\nof such weakness! Oh, no! And, no longer ago than the Cahorn affair, you\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin cries from the housetops that he will escape,\r\nhe has some object in view.\xe2\x80\x9d But, sapristi, you must understand that\r\nin order to escape I must create, in advance, a public belief in\r\nthat escape, a belief amounting to an article of faith, an absolute\r\nconviction, a reality as glittering as the sun. And I did create that\r\nbelief that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would escape, that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would not be\r\npresent at his trial. And when you gave your evidence and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nman is not Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\xe2\x80\x9d everybody was prepared to believe you. Had one\r\nperson doubted it, had any one uttered this simple restriction: Suppose\r\nit is Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?--from that moment, I was lost. If anyone had\r\nscrutinized my face, not imbued with the idea that I was not Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin, as you and the others did at my trial, but with the idea that I\r\nmight be Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin; then, despite all my precautions, I should have\r\nbeen recognized. But I had no fear. Logically, psychologically, no once\r\ncould entertain the idea that I was Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grasped Ganimard\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Ganimard, confess that on the Wednesday after our conversation in\r\nthe prison de la Sant\xc3\xa9, you expected me at your house at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nexactly as I said I would go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your prison-van?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ganimard, evading the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bluff! Some of my friends secured that old unused van and wished\r\nto make the attempt. But I considered it impractical without the\r\nconcurrence of a number of unusual circumstances. However, I found\r\nit useful to carry out that attempted escape and give it the widest\r\npublicity. An audaciously planned escape, though not completed, gave to\r\nthe succeeding one the character of reality simply by anticipation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that the cigar....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHollowed by myself, as well as the knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWritten by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the mysterious correspondent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGanimard reflected a moment, then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the anthropological service had Baudru\xe2\x80\x99s case under consideration,\r\nwhy did they not perceive that his measurements coincided with those of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy measurements are not in existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least, they are false. I have given considerable attention to\r\nthat question. In the first place, the Bertillon system records the\r\nvisible marks of identification--and you have seen that they are not\r\ninfallible--and, after that, the measurements of the head, the\r\nfingers, the ears, etc. Of course, such measurements are more or less\r\ninfallible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but it costs money to get around them. Before we left America, one\r\nof the employees of the service there accepted so much money to insert\r\nfalse figures in my measurements. Consequently, Baudru\xe2\x80\x99s measurements\r\nshould not agree with those of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence, Ganimard asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to take a rest, enjoy the best of food\r\nand drink and gradually recover my former healthy condition. It is all\r\nvery well to become Baudru or some other person, on occasion, and to\r\nchange your personality as you do your shirt, but you soon grow weary of\r\nthe change. I feel exactly as I imagine the man who lost his shadow must\r\nhave felt, and I shall be glad to be Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked to and fro for a few minutes, then, stopping in front of\r\nGanimard, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing more to say, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I should like to know if you intend to reveal the true state of\r\nfacts connected with your escape. The mistake that I made---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no one will ever know that it was Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin who was discharged.\r\nIt is to my own interest to surround myself with mystery, and therefore\r\nI shall permit my escape to retain its almost miraculous character. So,\r\nhave no fear on that score, my dear friend. I shall say nothing. And\r\nnow, good-bye. I am going out to dinner this evening, and have only\r\nsufficient time to dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI though you wanted a rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there are duties to society that one cannot avoid. To-morrow, I\r\nshall rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you dine to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the British Ambassador!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Mysterious Traveller\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening before, I had sent my automobile to Rouen by the highway.\r\nI was to travel to Rouen by rail, on my way to visit some friends that\r\nlive on the banks of the Seine.\r\n\r\nAt Paris, a few minutes before the train started, seven gentlemen\r\nentered my compartment; five of them were smoking. No matter that the\r\njourney was a short one, the thought of traveling with such a company\r\nwas not agreeable to me, especially as the car was built on the old\r\nmodel, without a corridor. I picked up my overcoat, my newspapers and my\r\ntime-table, and sought refuge in a neighboring compartment.\r\n\r\nIt was occupied by a lady, who, at sight of me, made a gesture of\r\nannoyance that did not escape my notice, and she leaned toward a\r\ngentleman who was standing on the step and was, no doubt, her husband.\r\nThe gentleman scrutinized me closely, and, apparently, my appearance did\r\nnot displease him, for he smiled as he spoke to his wife with the air\r\nof one who reassures a frightened child. She smiled also, and gave me a\r\nfriendly glance as if she now understood that I was one of those gallant\r\nmen with whom a woman can remain shut up for two hours in a little box,\r\nsix feet square, and have nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nHer husband said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an important appointment, my dear, and cannot wait any longer.\r\nAdieu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her affectionately and went away. His wife threw him a few\r\nkisses and waved her handkerchief. The whistle sounded, and the train\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nAt that precise moment, and despite the protests of the guards, the door\r\nwas opened, and a man rushed into our compartment. My companion, who\r\nwas standing and arranging her luggage, uttered a cry of terror and fell\r\nupon the seat. I am not a coward--far from it--but I confess that such\r\nintrusions at the last minute are always disconcerting. They have a\r\nsuspicious, unnatural aspect.\r\n\r\nHowever, the appearance of the new arrival greatly modified the\r\nunfavorable impression produced by his precipitant action. He was\r\ncorrectly and elegantly dressed, wore a tasteful cravat, correct gloves,\r\nand his face was refined and intelligent. But, where the devil had I\r\nseen that face before? Because, beyond all possible doubt, I had seen\r\nit. And yet the memory of it was so vague and indistinct that I felt it\r\nwould be useless to try to recall it at that time.\r\n\r\nThen, directing my attention to the lady, I was amazed at the pallor\r\nand anxiety I saw in her face. She was looking at her neighbor--they\r\noccupied seats on the same side of the compartment--with an expression\r\nof intense alarm, and I perceived that one of her trembling hands was\r\nslowly gliding toward a little traveling bag that was lying on the seat\r\nabout twenty inches from her. She finished by seizing it and nervously\r\ndrawing it to her. Our eyes met, and I read in hers so much anxiety and\r\nfear that I could not refrain from speaking to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill, madame? Shall I open the window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer only reply was a gesture indicating that she was afraid of our\r\ncompanion. I smiled, as her husband had done, shrugged my shoulders, and\r\nexplained to her, in pantomime, that she had nothing to fear, that I\r\nwas there, and, besides, the gentleman appeared to be a very harmless\r\nindividual. At that moment, he turned toward us, scrutinized both of us\r\nfrom head to foot, then settled down in his corner and paid us no more\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAfter a short silence, the lady, as if she had mustered all her energy\r\nto perform a desperate act, said to me, in an almost inaudible voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who is on our train?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe.... he....I assure you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not taken her eyes off our companion, and it was to him rather\r\nthan to me that she uttered the syllables of that disquieting name.\r\nHe drew his hat over his face. Was that to conceal his agitation or,\r\nsimply, to arrange himself for sleep? Then I said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday, through contumacy, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was sentenced to twenty\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment at hard labor. Therefore it is improbable that he\r\nwould be so imprudent, to-day, as to show himself in public. Moreover,\r\nthe newspapers have announced his appearance in Turkey since his escape\r\nfrom the Sant\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is on this train at the present moment,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady proclaimed,\r\nwith the obvious intention of being heard by our companion; \xe2\x80\x9cmy husband\r\nis one of the directors in the penitentiary service, and it was the\r\nstationmaster himself who told us that a search was being made for\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may have been mistaken---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he was seen in the waiting-room. He bought a first-class ticket for\r\nRouen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has disappeared. The guard at the waiting-room door did not see him\r\npass, and it is supposed that he had got into the express that leaves\r\nten minutes after us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, they will be sure to catch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless, at the last moment, he leaped from that train to come here,\r\ninto our train.... which is quite probable.... which is almost certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so, he will be arrested just the same; for the employees and guards\r\nwould no doubt observe his passage from one train to the other, and,\r\nwhen we arrive at Rouen, they will arrest him there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim--never! He will find some means of escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, I wish him \xe2\x80\x98bon voyage.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, in the meantime, think what he may do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He may do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was greatly agitated, and, truly, the situation justified, to some\r\nextent, her nervous excitement. I was impelled to say to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, there are many strange coincidences, but you need have no\r\nfear. Admitting that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is on this train, he will not commit\r\nany indiscretion; he will be only too happy to escape the peril that\r\nalready threatens him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy words did not reassure her, but she remained silent for a time. I\r\nunfolded my newspapers and read reports of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s trial, but, as\r\nthey contained nothing that was new to me, I was not greatly interested.\r\nMoreover, I was tired and sleepy. I felt my eyelids close and my head\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monsieur, you are not going to sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seized my newspaper, and looked at me with indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be very imprudent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d I assented.\r\n\r\nI struggled to keep awake. I looked through the window at the landscape\r\nand the fleeting clouds, but in a short time all that became confused\r\nand indistinct; the image of the nervous lady and the drowsy gentleman\r\nwere effaced from my memory, and I was buried in the soothing depths of\r\na profound sleep. The tranquility of my response was soon disturbed by\r\ndisquieting dreams, wherein a creature that had played the part and bore\r\nthe name of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin held an important place. He appeared to me\r\nwith his back laden with articles of value; he leaped over walls, and\r\nplundered castles. But the outlines of that creature, who was no longer\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, assumed a more definite form. He came toward me, growing\r\nlarger and larger, leaped into the compartment with incredible agility,\r\nand landed squarely on my chest. With a cry of fright and pain, I awoke.\r\nThe man, the traveller, our companion, with his knee on my breast, held\r\nme by the throat.\r\n\r\nMy sight was very indistinct, for my eyes were suffused with blood.\r\nI could see the lady, in a corner of the compartment, convulsed\r\nwith fright. I tried even not to resist. Besides, I did not have the\r\nstrength. My temples throbbed; I was almost strangled. One minute more,\r\nand I would have breathed my last. The man must have realized it, for he\r\nrelaxed his grip, but did not remove his hand. Then he took a cord, in\r\nwhich he had prepared a slip-knot, and tied my wrists together. In an\r\ninstant, I was bound, gagged, and helpless.\r\n\r\nCertainly, he accomplished the trick with an ease and skill that\r\nrevealed the hand of a master; he was, no doubt, a professional thief.\r\nNot a word, not a nervous movement; only coolness and audacity. And I\r\nwas there, lying on the bench, bound like a mummy, I--Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\r\n\r\nIt was anything but a laughing matter, and yet, despite the gravity\r\nof the situation, I keenly appreciated the humor and irony that it\r\ninvolved. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin seized and bound like a novice! robbed as if I\r\nwere an unsophisticated rustic--for, you must understand, the scoundrel\r\nhad deprived me of my purse and wallet! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, a victim, duped,\r\nvanquished....What an adventure!\r\n\r\nThe lady did not move. He did not even notice her. He contented himself\r\nwith picking up her traveling-bag that had fallen to the floor and\r\ntaking from it the jewels, purse, and gold and silver trinkets that it\r\ncontained. The lady opened her eyes, trembled with fear, drew the rings\r\nfrom her fingers and handed them to the man as if she wished to spare\r\nhim unnecessary trouble. He took the rings and looked at her. She\r\nswooned.\r\n\r\nThen, quite unruffled, he resumed his seat, lighted a cigarette, and\r\nproceeded to examine the treasure that he had acquired. The examination\r\nappeared to give him perfect satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut I was not so well satisfied. I do not speak of the twelve thousand\r\nfrancs of which I had been unduly deprived: that was only a temporary\r\nloss, because I was certain that I would recover possession of that\r\nmoney after a very brief delay, together with the important papers\r\ncontained in my wallet: plans, specifications, addresses, lists of\r\ncorrespondents, and compromising letters. But, for the moment, a more\r\nimmediate and more serious question troubled me: How would this affair\r\nend? What would be the outcome of this adventure?\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, the disturbance created by my passage through the\r\nSaint-Lazare station has not escaped my notice. Going to visit friends\r\nwho knew me under the name of Guillaume Berlat, and amongst whom my\r\nresemblance to Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was a subject of many innocent jests, I\r\ncould not assume a disguise, and my presence had been remarked.\r\nSo, beyond question, the commissary of police at Rouen, notified by\r\ntelegraph, and assisted by numerous agents, would be awaiting the train,\r\nwould question all suspicious passengers, and proceed to search the\r\ncars.\r\n\r\nOf course, I had foreseen all that, but it had not disturbed me, as I\r\nwas certain that the police of Rouen would not be any shrewder than the\r\npolice of Paris and that I could escape recognition; would it not be\r\nsufficient for me to carelessly display my card as \xe2\x80\x9cd\xc3\xa9put\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d thanks\r\nto which I had inspired complete confidence in the gate-keeper at\r\nSaint-Lazare?--But the situation was greatly changed. I was no longer\r\nfree. It was impossible to attempt one of my usual tricks. In one of\r\nthe compartments, the commissary of police would find Mon. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin,\r\nbound hand and foot, as docile as a lamb, packed up, all ready to be\r\ndumped into a prison-van. He would have simply to accept delivery of the\r\nparcel, the same as if it were so much merchandise or a basket of fruit\r\nand vegetables. Yet, to avoid that shameful d\xc3\xa9nouement, what could I\r\ndo?--bound and gagged, as I was? And the train was rushing on toward\r\nRouen, the next and only station.\r\n\r\nAnother problem was presented, in which I was less interested, but\r\nthe solution of which aroused my professional curiosity. What were the\r\nintentions of my rascally companion? Of course, if I had been alone, he\r\ncould, on our arrival at Rouen, leave the car slowly and fearlessly. But\r\nthe lady? As soon as the door of the compartment should be opened, the\r\nlady, now so quiet and humble, would scream and call for help. That was\r\nthe dilemma that perplexed me! Why had he not reduced her to a helpless\r\ncondition similar to mine? That would have given him ample time to\r\ndisappear before his double crime was discovered.\r\n\r\nHe was still smoking, with his eyes fixed upon the window that was\r\nnow being streaked with drops of rain. Once he turned, picked up my\r\ntime-table, and consulted it.\r\n\r\nThe lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order to\r\ndeceive the enemy. But fits of coughing, provoked by the smoke, exposed\r\nher true condition. As to me, I was very uncomfortable, and very tired.\r\nAnd I meditated; I plotted.\r\n\r\nThe train was rushing on, joyously, intoxicated with its own speed.\r\n\r\nSaint Etienne!....At that moment, the man arose and took two steps\r\ntoward us, which caused the lady to utter a cry of alarm and fall into\r\na genuine swoon. What was the man about to do? He lowered the window\r\non our side. A heavy rain was now falling, and, by a gesture, the man\r\nexpressed his annoyance at his not having an umbrella or an overcoat. He\r\nglanced at the rack. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella was there. He took it. He also\r\ntook my overcoat and put it on.\r\n\r\nWe were now crossing the Seine. He turned up the bottoms of his\r\ntrousers, then leaned over and raised the exterior latch of the door.\r\nWas he going to throw himself upon the track? At that speed, it would\r\nhave been instant death. We now entered a tunnel. The man opened the\r\ndoor half-way and stood on the upper step. What folly! The darkness, the\r\nsmoke, the noise, all gave a fantastic appearance to his actions. But\r\nsuddenly, the train diminished its speed. A moment later it increased\r\nits speed, then slowed up again. Probably, some repairs were being made\r\nin that part of the tunnel which obliged the trains to diminish their\r\nspeed, and the man was aware of the fact. He immediately stepped down to\r\nthe lower step, closed the door behind him, and leaped to the ground. He\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nThe lady immediately recovered her wits, and her first act was to lament\r\nthe loss of her jewels. I gave her an imploring look. She understood,\r\nand quickly removed the gag that stifled me. She wished to untie the\r\ncords that bound me, but I prevented her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, the police must see everything exactly as it stands. I want\r\nthem to see what the rascal did to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I pull the alarm-bell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late. You should have done that when he made the attack on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he would have killed me. Ah! monsieur, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you that he\r\nwas on this train. I recognized him from his portrait. And now he has\r\ngone off with my jewels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry. The police will catch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! Never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends on you, madame. Listen. When we arrive at Rouen, be at the\r\ndoor and call. Make a noise. The police and the railway employees will\r\ncome. Tell what you have seen: the assault made on me and the flight of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Give a description of him--soft hat, umbrella--yours--gray\r\novercoat....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! mine? Not at all. It was his. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one when he came in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.... unless the coat was one that some one had forgotten and\r\nleft in the rack. At all events, he had it when he went away, and that\r\nis the essential point. A gray overcoat--remember!....Ah! I forgot.\r\nYou must tell your name, first thing you do. Your husband\xe2\x80\x99s official\r\nposition will stimulate the zeal of the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the station. I gave her some further instructions in a\r\nrather imperious tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell them my name--Guillaume Berlat. If necessary, say that you know\r\nme. That will save time. We must expedite the preliminary investigation.\r\nThe important thing is the pursuit of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. Your jewels,\r\nremember! Let there be no mistake. Guillaume Berlat, a friend of your\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand....Guillaume Berlat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was already calling and gesticulating. As soon as the train stopped,\r\nseveral men entered the compartment. The critical moment had come.\r\n\r\nPanting for breath, the lady exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.... he attacked us.... he stole my jewels....I am Madame\r\nRenaud.... my husband is a director of the penitentiary service....Ah!\r\nhere is my brother, Georges Ardelle, director of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nRouennais.... you must know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe embraced a young man who had just joined us, and whom the commissary\r\nsaluted. Then she continued, weeping:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.... while monsieur was sleeping, he seized him by the\r\nthroat....Mon. Berlat, a friend of my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commissary asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe leaped from the train, when passing through the tunnel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that it was he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I sure! I recognized him perfectly. Besides, he was seen at the\r\nSaint-Lazare station. He wore a soft hat---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, a hard felt, like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary, pointing to my hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a soft hat, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Madame Renaud, \xe2\x80\x9cand a gray\r\novercoat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the commissary, \xe2\x80\x9cthe telegram says he wore\r\na gray overcoat with a black velvet collar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly, a black velvet collar,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame Renaud, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nI breathed freely. Ah! the excellent friend I had in that little woman.\r\n\r\nThe police agents had now released me. I bit my lips until they ran\r\nblood. Stooping over, with my handkerchief over my mouth, an attitude\r\nquite natural in a person who has remained for a long time in an\r\nuncomfortable position, and whose mouth shows the bloody marks of the\r\ngag, I addressed the commissary, in a weak voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, it was Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. There is no doubt about that. If we make\r\nhaste, he can be caught yet. I think I may be of some service to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe railway car, in which the crime occurred, was detached from the\r\ntrain to serve as a mute witness at the official investigation. The\r\ntrain continued on its way to Havre. We were then conducted to the\r\nstation-master\xe2\x80\x99s office through a crowd of curious spectators.\r\n\r\nThen, I had a sudden access of doubt and discretion. Under some pretext\r\nor other, I must gain my automobile, and escape. To remain there was\r\ndangerous. Something might happen; for instance, a telegram from Paris,\r\nand I would be lost.\r\n\r\nYes, but what about my thief? Abandoned to my own resources, in an\r\nunfamiliar country, I could not hope to catch him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! I must make the attempt,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a difficult\r\ngame, but an amusing one, and the stake is well worth the trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when the commissary asked us to repeat the story of the robbery, I\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, really, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is getting the start of us. My\r\nautomobile is waiting in the courtyard. If you will be so kind as to use\r\nit, we can try....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commissary smiled, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea is a good one; so good, indeed, that it is already being\r\ncarried out. Two of my men have set out on bicycles. They have been gone\r\nfor some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did they go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the entrance of the tunnel. There, they will gather evidence, secure\r\nwitnesses, and follow on the track of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not refrain from shrugging my shoulders, as I replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour men will not secure any evidence or any witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin will not allow anyone to see him emerge from the tunnel.\r\nHe will take the first road---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Rouen, where we will arrest him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not go to Rouen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he will remain in the vicinity, where his capture will be even\r\nmore certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not remain in the vicinity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! And where will he hide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the present moment, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is prowling around the station at\r\nDarn\xc3\xa9tal. At ten fifty, that is, in twenty-two minutes from now, he will\r\ntake the train that goes from Rouen to Amiens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so? How do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is quite simple. While we were in the car, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nconsulted my railway guide. Why did he do it? Was there, not far from\r\nthe spot where he disappeared, another line of railway, a station\r\nupon that line, and a train stopping at that station? On consulting my\r\nrailway guide, I found such to be the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a marvelous deduction.\r\nI congratulate you on your skill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was now convinced that I had made a mistake in displaying so much\r\ncleverness. The commissary regarded me with astonishment, and I thought\r\na slight suspicion entered his official mind....Oh! scarcely that, for\r\nthe photographs distributed broadcast by the police department were too\r\nimperfect; they presented an Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin so different from the one he\r\nhad before him, that he could not possibly recognize me by it. But, all\r\nthe same, he was troubled, confused and ill-at-ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu! nothing stimulates the comprehension so much as the loss of a\r\npocketbook and the desire to recover it. And it seems to me that if you\r\nwill give me two of your men, we may be able....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I beg of you, monsieur le commissaire,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Renaud,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clisten to Mon. Berlat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe intervention of my excellent friend was decisive. Pronounced by her,\r\nthe wife of an influential official, the name of Berlat became really\r\nmy own, and gave me an identity that no mere suspicion could affect. The\r\ncommissary arose, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Monsieur Berlat, I shall be delighted to see you succeed. I\r\nam as much interested as you are in the arrest of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accompanied me to the automobile, and introduced two of his men,\r\nHonor\xc3\xa9 Massol and Gaston Delivet, who were assigned to assist me. My\r\nchauffer cranked up the car and I took my place at the wheel. A few\r\nseconds later, we left the station. I was saved.\r\n\r\nAh! I must confess that in rolling over the boulevards that surrounded\r\nthe old Norman city, in my swift thirty-five horse-power Moreau-Lepton,\r\nI experienced a deep feeling of pride, and the motor responded,\r\nsympathetically to my desires. At right and left, the trees flew past\r\nus with startling rapidity, and I, free, out of danger, had simply to\r\narrange my little personal affairs with the two honest representatives\r\nof the Rouen police who were sitting behind me. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was going\r\nin search of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\r\n\r\nModest guardians of social order--Gaston Delivet and Honor\xc3\xa9 Massol--how\r\nvaluable was your assistance! What would I have done without you?\r\nWithout you, many times, at the cross-roads, I might have taken the\r\nwrong route! Without you, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would have made a mistake, and\r\nthe other would have escaped!\r\n\r\nBut the end was not yet. Far from it. I had yet to capture the thief and\r\nrecover the stolen papers. Under no circumstances must my two acolytes\r\nbe permitted to see those papers, much less to seize them. That was a\r\npoint that might give me some difficulty.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Darn\xc3\xa9tal three minutes after the departure of the train.\r\nTrue, I had the consolation of learning that a man wearing a gray\r\novercoat with a black velvet collar had taken the train at the station.\r\nHe had bought a second-class ticket for Amiens. Certainly, my d\xc3\xa9but as\r\ndetective was a promising one.\r\n\r\nDelivet said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe train is express, and the next stop is Mont\xc3\xa9rolier-Buchy in\r\nnineteen minutes. If we do not reach there before Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, he can\r\nproceed to Amiens, or change for the train going to Cl\xc3\xa8res, and, from\r\nthat point, reach Dieppe or Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far to Mont\xc3\xa9rolier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-three kilometres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-three kilometres in nineteen minutes....We will be there ahead\r\nof him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were off again! Never had my faithful Moreau-Repton responded to\r\nmy impatience with such ardor and regularity. It participated in my\r\nanxiety. It indorsed my determination. It comprehended my animosity\r\nagainst that rascally Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. The knave! The traitor!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn to the right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Delivet, \xe2\x80\x9cthen to the left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe fairly flew, scarcely touching the ground. The mile-stones looked\r\nlike little timid beasts that vanished at our approach. Suddenly, at a\r\nturn of the road, we saw a vortex of smoke. It was the Northern Express.\r\nFor a kilometre, it was a struggle, side by side, but an unequal\r\nstruggle in which the issue was certain. We won the race by twenty\r\nlengths.\r\n\r\nIn three seconds we were on the platform standing before the\r\nsecond-class carriages. The doors were opened, and some passengers\r\nalighted, but not my thief. We made a search through the compartments.\r\nNo sign of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSapristi!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9che must have recognized me in the automobile as we\r\nwere racing, side by side, and he leaped from the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there he is now! crossing the track.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI started in pursuit of the man, followed by my two acolytes, or rather\r\nfollowed by one of them, for the other, Massol, proved himself to be a\r\nrunner of exceptional speed and endurance. In a few moments, he had made\r\nan appreciable gain upon the fugitive. The man noticed it, leaped over\r\na hedge, scampered across a meadow, and entered a thick grove. When we\r\nreached this grove, Massol was waiting for us. He went no farther, for\r\nfear of losing us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter such a run, our victim\r\nmust be out of wind. We will catch him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone in the\r\narrest of the fugitive, in order to recover my papers, concerning which\r\nthe authorities would doubtless ask many disagreeable questions. Then I\r\nreturned to my companions, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all quite easy. You, Massol, take your place at the left; you,\r\nDelivet, at the right. From there, you can observe the entire posterior\r\nline of the bush, and he cannot escape without you seeing him, except by\r\nthat ravine, and I shall watch it. If he does not come out voluntarily,\r\nI will enter and drive him out toward one or the other of you. You have\r\nsimply to wait. Ah! I forgot: in case I need you, a pistol shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMassol and Delivet walked away to their respective posts. As soon as\r\nthey had disappeared, I entered the grove with the greatest precaution\r\nso as to be neither seen nor heard. I encountered dense thickets,\r\nthrough which narrow paths had been cut, but the overhanging boughs\r\ncompelled me to adopt a stooping posture. One of these paths led to a\r\nclearing in which I found footsteps upon the wet grass. I followed them;\r\nthey led me to the foot of a mound which was surmounted by a deserted,\r\ndilapidated hovel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be there,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a well-chosen retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI crept cautiously to the side of the building. A slight noise informed\r\nme that he was there; and, then, through an opening, I saw him. His back\r\nwas turned toward me. In two bounds, I was upon him. He tried to fire\r\na revolver that he held in his hand. But he had no time. I threw him to\r\nthe ground, in such a manner that his arms were beneath him, twisted and\r\nhelpless, whilst I held him down with my knee on his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered in his ear. \xe2\x80\x9cI am Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. You are\r\nto deliver over to me, immediately and gracefully, my pocketbook and the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s jewels, and, in return therefore, I will save you from the police\r\nand enroll you amongst my friends. One word: yes or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Your escape, this morning, was well planned. I congratulate\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI arose. He fumbled in his pocket, drew out a large knife and tried to\r\nstrike me with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImbecile!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nWith one hand, I parried the attack; with the other, I gave him a sharp\r\nblow on the carotid artery. He fell--stunned!\r\n\r\nIn my pocketbook, I recovered my papers and bank-notes. Out of\r\ncuriosity, I took his. Upon an envelope, addressed to him, I read his\r\nname: Pierre Onfrey. It startled me. Pierre Onfrey, the assassin of the\r\nrue Lafontaine at Auteuil! Pierre Onfrey, he who had cut the throats of\r\nMadame Delbois and her two daughters. I leaned over him. Yes, those were\r\nthe features which, in the compartment, had evoked in me the memory of a\r\nface I could not then recall.\r\n\r\nBut time was passing. I placed in an envelope two bank-notes of one\r\nhundred francs each, with a card bearing these words: \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nto his worthy colleagues Honor\xc3\xa9 Massol and Gaston Delivet, as a slight\r\ntoken of his gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d I placed it in a prominent spot in the room,\r\nwhere they would be sure to find it. Beside it, I placed Madame Renaud\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandbag. Why could I not return it to the lady who had befriended me?\r\nI must confess that I had taken from it everything that possessed any\r\ninterest or value, leaving there only a shell comb, a stick of rouge\r\nDorin for the lips, and an empty purse. But, you know, business\r\nis business. And then, really, her husband is engaged in such a\r\ndishonorable vocation!\r\n\r\nThe man was becoming conscious. What was I to do? I was unable to save\r\nhim or condemn him. So I took his revolver and fired a shot in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy two acolytes will come and attend to his case,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, as\r\nI hastened away by the road through the ravine. Twenty minutes later, I\r\nwas seated in my automobile.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I telegraphed to my friends at Rouen that an unexpected\r\nevent would prevent me from making my promised visit. Between ourselves,\r\nconsidering what my friends must now know, my visit is postponed\r\nindefinitely. A cruel disillusion for them!\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock I was in Paris. The evening newspapers informed me that\r\nPierre Onfrey had been captured at last.\r\n\r\nNext day,--let us not despise the advantages of judicious\r\nadvertising,--the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France\xe2\x80\x99 published this sensational item:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday, near Buchy, after numerous exciting incidents, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\neffected the arrest of Pierre Onfrey. The assassin of the rue Lafontaine\r\nhad robbed Madame Renaud, wife of the director in the penitentiary\r\nservice, in a railway carriage on the Paris-Havre line. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nrestored to Madame Renaud the hand-bag that contained her jewels, and\r\ngave a generous recompense to the two detectives who had assisted him in\r\nmaking that dramatic arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three times each year, on occasions of unusual importance,\r\nsuch as the balls at the Austrian Embassy or the soir\xc3\xa9es of Lady\r\nBillingstone, the Countess de Dreux-Soubise wore upon her white\r\nshoulders \xe2\x80\x9cThe Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, the famous necklace, the legendary necklace that\r\nBohmer and Bassenge, court jewelers, had made for Madame Du Barry; the\r\nveritable necklace that the Cardinal de Rohan-Soubise intended to give\r\nto Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France; and the same that the adventuress\r\nJeanne de Valois, Countess de la Motte, had pulled to pieces one evening\r\nin February, 1785, with the aid of her husband and their accomplice,\r\nR\xc3\xa9taux de Villette.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, the mounting alone was genuine. R\xc3\xa9taux de Villette\r\nhad kept it, whilst the Count de la Motte and his wife scattered to the\r\nfour winds of heaven the beautiful stones so carefully chosen by Bohmer.\r\nLater, he sold the mounting to Gaston de Dreux-Soubise, nephew and heir\r\nof the Cardinal, who re-purchased the few diamonds that remained in\r\nthe possession of the English jeweler, Jeffreys; supplemented them with\r\nother stones of the same size but of much inferior quality, and thus\r\nrestored the marvelous necklace to the form in which it had come from\r\nthe hands of Bohmer and Bassenge.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century, the house of Dreux-Soubise had prided itself upon\r\nthe possession of this historic jewel. Although adverse circumstances\r\nhad greatly reduced their fortune, they preferred to curtail their\r\nhousehold expenses rather than part with this relic of royalty. More\r\nparticularly, the present count clung to it as a man clings to the\r\nhome of his ancestors. As a matter of prudence, he had rented a\r\nsafety-deposit box at the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Lyonnais in which to keep it. He went\r\nfor it himself on the afternoon of the day on which his wife wished to\r\nwear it, and he, himself, carried it back next morning.\r\n\r\nOn this particular evening, at the reception given at the Palais\r\nde Castille, the Countess achieved a remarkable success; and King\r\nChristian, in whose honor the f\xc3\xaate was given, commented on her grace\r\nand beauty. The thousand facets of the diamond sparkled and shone like\r\nflames of fire about her shapely neck and shoulders, and it is safe to\r\nsay that none but she could have borne the weight of such an ornament\r\nwith so much ease and grace.\r\n\r\nThis was a double triumph, and the Count de Dreux was highly elated\r\nwhen they returned to their chamber in the old house of the faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain. He was proud of his wife, and quite as proud, perhaps,\r\nof the necklace that had conferred added luster to his noble house\r\nfor generations. His wife, also, regarded the necklace with an almost\r\nchildish vanity, and it was not without regret that she removed it\r\nfrom her shoulders and handed it to her husband who admired it as\r\npassionately as if he had never seen it before. Then, having placed it\r\nin its case of red leather, stamped with the Cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s arms, he passed\r\ninto an adjoining room which was simply an alcove or cabinet that had\r\nbeen cut off from their chamber, and which could be entered only by\r\nmeans of a door at the foot of their bed. As he had done on previous\r\noccasions, he hid it on a high shelf amongst hat-boxes and piles of\r\nlinen. He closed the door, and retired.\r\n\r\nNext morning, he arose about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, intending to go to the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nLyonnais before breakfast. He dressed, drank a cup of coffee, and went\r\nto the stables to give his orders. The condition of one of the horses\r\nworried him. He caused it to be exercised in his presence. Then he\r\nreturned to his wife, who had not yet left the chamber. Her maid was\r\ndressing her hair. When her husband entered, she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as far as the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. That is wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe entered the cabinet; but, after a few seconds, and without any sign\r\nof astonishment, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you take it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?....No, I have not taken anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have moved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I have not even opened that door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared at the door, disconcerted, and stammered, in a scarcely\r\nintelligible voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t....It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t you?....Then....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hastened to his assistance, and, together, they made a thorough\r\nsearch, throwing the boxes to the floor and overturning the piles of\r\nlinen. Then the count said, quite discouraged:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless to look any more. I put it here, on this shelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it was on this shelf--nowhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey lighted a candle, as the room was quite dark, and then carried out\r\nall the linen and other articles that the room contained. And, when the\r\nroom was emptied, they confessed, in despair, that the famous necklace\r\nhad disappeared. Without losing time in vain lamentations, the countess\r\nnotified the commissary of police, Mon. Valorbe, who came at once, and,\r\nafter hearing their story, inquired of the count:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that no one passed through your chamber during the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely sure, as I am a very light sleeper. Besides, the chamber\r\ndoor was bolted, and I remember unbolting it this morning when my wife\r\nrang for her maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is no other entrance to the cabinet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo windows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it is closed up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCandles were lighted, and Mon. Valorbe observed at once that the lower\r\nhalf of the window was covered by a large press which was, however, so\r\nnarrow that it did not touch the casement on either side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what does this window open?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA small inner court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have a floor above this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo; but, on a level with the servant\xe2\x80\x99s floor, there is a close grating\r\nover the court. That is why this room is so dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the press was moved, they found that the window was fastened, which\r\nwould not have been the case if anyone had entered that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, \xe2\x80\x9cthey went out through our chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, you would have found the door unbolted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commissary considered the situation for a moment, then asked the\r\ncountess:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid any of your servants know that you wore the necklace last evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t conceal the fact. But nobody knew that it was\r\nhidden in that cabinet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one.... unless....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quite sure, madam, as it is a very important point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to her husband, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of Henriette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenriette? She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where we kept it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this woman Henriette?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mon. Valorbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA school-mate, who was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her.\r\nAfter her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death, I furnished an apartment in this house for\r\nher and her son. She is clever with her needle and has done some work\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat floor is she on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame as ours.... at the end of the corridor.... and I think.... the\r\nwindow of her kitchen....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpens on this little court, does it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just opposite ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Valorbe then asked to see Henriette. They went to her apartment;\r\nshe was sewing, whilst her son Raoul, about six years old, was sitting\r\nbeside her, reading. The commissary was surprised to see the wretched\r\napartment that had been provided for the woman. It consisted of one room\r\nwithout a fireplace, and a very small room that served as a kitchen. The\r\ncommissary proceeded to question her. She appeared to be overwhelmed on\r\nlearning of the theft. Last evening she had herself dressed the countess\r\nand placed the necklace upon her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cit can\xe2\x80\x99t be possible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have no idea? Not the least suspicion? Is it possible that the\r\nthief may have passed through your room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed heartily, never supposing that she could be an object of\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have not left my room. I never go out. And, perhaps, you have not\r\nseen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the kitchen window, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, it is at least three metres to the ledge of the opposite window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that we supposed the theft might have been committed in\r\nthat way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut.... the necklace was in the cabinet, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have always known that it was kept there at night. It had been\r\nmentioned in my presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face, though still young, bore unmistakable traces of sorrow and\r\nresignation. And it now assumed an expression of anxiety as if some\r\ndanger threatened her. She drew her son toward her. The child took her\r\nhand, and kissed it affectionately.\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone again, the count said to the commissary:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not suppose you suspect Henriette. I can answer for her. She is\r\nhonesty itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mon. Valorbe. \xe2\x80\x9cAt most, I thought\r\nthere might have been an unconscious complicity. But I confess that even\r\nthat theory must be abandoned, as it does not help solve the problem now\r\nbefore us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commissary of police abandoned the investigation, which was now\r\ntaken up and completed by the examining judge. He questioned the\r\nservants, examined the condition of the bolt, experimented with the\r\nopening and closing of the cabinet window, and explored the little court\r\nfrom top to bottom. All was in vain. The bolt was intact. The window\r\ncould not be opened or closed from the outside.\r\n\r\nThe inquiries especially concerned Henriette, for, in spite of\r\neverything, they always turned in her direction. They made a thorough\r\ninvestigation of her past life, and ascertained that, during the last\r\nthree years, she had left the house only four times, and her business,\r\non those occasions, was satisfactorily explained. As a matter of fact,\r\nshe acted as chambermaid and seamstress to the countess, who treated her\r\nwith great strictness and even severity.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week, the examining judge had secured no more definite\r\ninformation than the commissary of police. The judge said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmitting that we know the guilty party, which we do not, we are\r\nconfronted by the fact that we do not know how the theft was\r\ncommitted. We are brought face to face with two obstacles: a door and a\r\nwindow--both closed and fastened. It is thus a double mystery. How could\r\nanyone enter, and, moreover, how could any one escape, leaving behind\r\nhim a bolted door and a fastened window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the end of four months, the secret opinion of the judge was that the\r\ncount and countess, being hard pressed for money, which was their normal\r\ncondition, had sold the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace. He closed the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the famous jewel was a severe blow to the Dreux-Soubise.\r\nTheir credit being no longer propped up by the reserve fund that such a\r\ntreasure constituted, they found themselves confronted by more exacting\r\ncreditors and money-lenders. They were obliged to cut down to the quick,\r\nto sell or mortgage every article that possessed any commercial value.\r\nIn brief, it would have been their ruin, if two large legacies from some\r\ndistant relatives had not saved them.\r\n\r\nTheir pride also suffered a downfall, as if they had lost a quartering\r\nfrom their escutcheon. And, strange to relate, it was upon her former\r\nschoolmate, Henriette, that the countess vented her spleen. Toward\r\nher, the countess displayed the most spiteful feelings, and even openly\r\naccused her. First, Henriette was relegated to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 quarters,\r\nand, next day, discharged.\r\n\r\nFor some time, the count and countess passed an uneventful life. They\r\ntraveled a great deal. Only one incident of record occurred during that\r\nperiod. Some months after the departure of Henriette, the countess was\r\nsurprised when she received and read the following letter, signed by\r\nHenriette:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know how to thank you; for it was you, was it not,\r\nwho sent me that? It could not have been anyone else. No one but you\r\nknows where I live. If I am wrong, excuse me, and accept my sincere\r\nthanks for your past favors....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat did the letter mean? The present or past favors of the countess\r\nconsisted principally of injustice and neglect. Why, then, this letter\r\nof thanks?\r\n\r\nWhen asked for an explanation, Henriette replied that she had received\r\na letter, through the mails, enclosing two bank-notes of one thousand\r\nfrancs each. The envelope, which she enclosed with her reply, bore the\r\nParis post-mark, and was addressed in a handwriting that was obviously\r\ndisguised. Now, whence came those two thousand francs? Who had sent\r\nthem? And why had they sent them?\r\n\r\nHenriette received a similar letter and a like sum of money twelve\r\nmonths later. And a third time; and a fourth; and each year for a period\r\nof six years, with this difference, that in the fifth and sixth years\r\nthe sum was doubled. There was another difference: the post-office\r\nauthorities having seized one of the letters under the pretext that it\r\nwas not registered, the last two letters were duly sent according to the\r\npostal regulations, the first dated from Saint-Germain, the other from\r\nSuresnes. The writer signed the first one, \xe2\x80\x9cAnquety\xe2\x80\x9d; and the other,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa9chard.\xe2\x80\x9d The addresses that he gave were false.\r\n\r\nAt the end of six years, Henriette died, and the mystery remained\r\nunsolved.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAll these events are known to the public. The case was one of those\r\nwhich excite public interest, and it was a strange coincidence that this\r\nnecklace, which had caused such a great commotion in France at the close\r\nof the eighteenth century, should create a similar commotion a century\r\nlater. But what I am about to relate is known only to the parties\r\ndirectly interested and a few others from whom the count exacted a\r\npromise of secrecy. As it is probable that some day or other that\r\npromise will be broken, I have no hesitation in rending the veil and\r\nthus disclosing the key to the mystery, the explanation of the letter\r\npublished in the morning papers two days ago; an extraordinary letter\r\nwhich increased, if possible, the mists and shadows that envelope this\r\ninscrutable drama.\r\n\r\nFive days ago, a number of guests were dining with the Count de\r\nDreux-Soubise. There were several ladies present, including his two\r\nnieces and his cousin, and the following gentlemen: the president of\r\nEssaville, the deputy Bochas, the chevalier Floriani, whom the count had\r\nknown in Sicily, and General Marquis de Rouzi\xc3\xa8res, an old club friend.\r\n\r\nAfter the repast, coffee was served by the ladies, who gave the\r\ngentlemen permission to smoke their cigarettes, provided they would not\r\ndesert the salon. The conversation was general, and finally one of the\r\nguests chanced to speak of celebrated crimes. And that gave the Marquis\r\nde Rouzi\xc3\xa8res, who delighted to tease the count, an opportunity to\r\nmention the affair of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace, a subject that the count\r\ndetested.\r\n\r\nEach one expressed his own opinion of the affair; and, of course, their\r\nvarious theories were not only contradictory but impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess to the chevalier Floriani, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nis your opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I--I have no opinion, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the guests protested; for the chevalier had just related in an\r\nentertaining manner various adventures in which he had participated with\r\nhis father, a magistrate at Palermo, and which established his judgment\r\nand taste in such manners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have sometimes succeeded in unraveling\r\nmysteries that the cleverest detectives have renounced; yet I do not\r\nclaim to be Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, I know very little about the\r\naffair of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody now turned to the count, who was thus obliged, quite\r\nunwillingly, to narrate all the circumstances connected with the theft.\r\nThe chevalier listened, reflected, asked a few questions, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very strange.... at first sight, the problem appears to be a very\r\nsimple one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count shrugged his shoulders. The others drew closer to the\r\nchevalier, who continued, in a dogmatic tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general rule, in order to find the author of a crime or a theft,\r\nit is necessary to determine how that crime or theft was committed, or,\r\nat least, how it could have been committed. In the present case, nothing\r\nis more simple, because we are face to face, not with several theories,\r\nbut with one positive fact, that is to say: the thief could only enter\r\nby the chamber door or the window of the cabinet. Now, a person cannot\r\nopen a bolted door from the outside. Therefore, he must have entered\r\nthrough the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was closed and fastened, and we found it fastened afterward,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n declared the count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Floriani, without heeding the\r\ninterruption, \xe2\x80\x9che had simply to construct a bridge, a plank or a ladder,\r\nbetween the balcony of the kitchen and the ledge of the window, and as\r\nthe jewel-case---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I repeat that the window was fastened,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the count,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nThis time, Floriani was obliged to reply. He did so with the greatest\r\ntranquility, as if the objection was the most insignificant affair in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will admit that it was; but is there not a transom in the upper part\r\nof the window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, that was customary in houses of that date; and,\r\nin the second place, without such a transom, the theft cannot be\r\nexplained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is one, but it was closed, the same as the window.\r\nConsequently, we did not pay attention to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a mistake; for, if you had examined it, you would have found\r\nthat it had been opened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume that, like all others, it opens by means of a wire with a\r\nring on the lower end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I do not see---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, through a hole in the window, a person could, by the aid of some\r\ninstrument, let us say a poker with a hook at the end, grip the ring,\r\npull down, and open the transom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent! excellent! Your scheme is very cleverly constructed, but you\r\noverlook one thing, monsieur, there is no hole in the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, we would have seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to see it, you must look for it, and no one has looked. The\r\nhole is there; it must be there, at the side of the window, in the\r\nputty. In a vertical direction, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count arose. He was greatly excited. He paced up and down the room,\r\ntwo or three times, in a nervous manner; then, approaching Floriani,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody has been in that room since; nothing has been changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, monsieur, you can easily satisfy yourself that my\r\nexplanation is correct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not agree with the facts established by the examining judge.\r\nYou have seen nothing, and yet you contradict all that we have seen and\r\nall that we know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFloriani paid no attention to the count\xe2\x80\x99s petulance. He simply smiled\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, monsieur, I submit my theory; that is all. If I am mistaken,\r\nyou can easily prove it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do so at once....I confess that your assurance---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count muttered a few more words; then suddenly rushed to the door\r\nand passed out. Not a word was uttered in his absence; and this profound\r\nsilence gave the situation an air of almost tragic importance. Finally,\r\nthe count returned. He was pale and nervous. He said to his friends, in\r\na trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon.... the revelations of the chevalier were so\r\nunexpected....I should never have thought....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife questioned him, eagerly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak.... what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cThe hole is there, at the very spot, at the side of the\r\nwindow---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized the chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and said to him in an imperious tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, monsieur, proceed. I admit that you are right so far, but\r\nnow.... that is not all.... go on.... tell us the rest of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFloriani disengaged his arm gently, and, after a moment, continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in my opinion, this is what happened. The thief, knowing that the\r\ncountess was going to wear the necklace that evening, had prepared his\r\ngangway or bridge during your absence. He watched you through the window\r\nand saw you hide the necklace. Afterward, he cut the glass and pulled\r\nthe ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but the distance was so great that it would be impossible for him\r\nto reach the window-fastening through the transom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if he could not open the window by reaching through the\r\ntransom, he must have crawled through the transom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible; it is too small. No man could crawl through it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was not a man,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Floriani.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the transom is too small to admit a man, it must have been a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not say that your friend Henriette had a son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a son named Raoul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, in all probability, it was Raoul who committed the theft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof have you of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof! Plenty of it....For instance---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and reflected for a moment, then continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance, that gangway or bridge. It is improbable that the child\r\ncould have brought it in from outside the house and carried it away\r\nagain without being observed. He must have used something close at hand.\r\nIn the little room used by Henriette as a kitchen, were there not some\r\nshelves against the wall on which she placed her pans and dishes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo shelves, to the best of my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that those shelves are really fastened to the wooden\r\nbrackets that support them? For, if they are not, we could be justified\r\nin presuming that the child removed them, fastened them together, and\r\nthus formed his bridge. Perhaps, also, since there was a stove, we might\r\nfind the bent poker that he used to open the transom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, the count left the room; and, this time, those\r\npresent did not feel the nervous anxiety they had experienced the\r\nfirst time. They were confident that Floriani was right, and no one was\r\nsurprised when the count returned and declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the child. Everything proves it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen the shelves and the poker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The shelves have been unnailed, and the poker is there yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the countess exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better say it was his mother. Henriette is the guilty party.\r\nShe must have compelled her son---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the chevalier, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mother had nothing to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! they occupied the same room. The child could not have done it\r\nwithout the mother\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, they lived in the same room, but all this happened in the\r\nadjoining room, during the night, while the mother was asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the necklace?\xe2\x80\x9d said the count. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been found amongst\r\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me! He had been out. That morning, on which you found him\r\nreading, he had just come from school, and perhaps the commissary of\r\npolice, instead of wasting his time on the innocent mother, would\r\nhave been better employed in searching the child\xe2\x80\x99s desk amongst his\r\nschool-books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you explain those two thousand francs that Henriette\r\nreceived each year? Are they not evidence of her complicity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she had been an accomplice, would she have thanked you for that\r\nmoney? And then, was she not closely watched? But the child, being free,\r\ncould easily go to a neighboring city, negotiate with some dealer and\r\nsell him one diamond or two diamonds, as he might wish, upon condition\r\nthat the money should be sent from Paris, and that proceeding could be\r\nrepeated from year to year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn indescribable anxiety oppressed the Dreux-Soubise and their guests.\r\nThere was something in the tone and attitude of Floriani--something more\r\nthan the chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s assurance which, from the beginning, had so annoyed\r\nthe count. There was a touch of irony, that seemed rather hostile than\r\nsympathetic. But the count affected to laugh, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is very ingenious and interesting, and I congratulate you upon\r\nyour vivid imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Floriani, with the utmost gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine\r\nnothing. I simply describe the events as they must have occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you know about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you yourself have told me. I picture to myself the life of the\r\nmother and child down there in the country; the illness of the mother,\r\nthe schemes of and inventions of the child to sell the precious stones in\r\norder to save his mother\xe2\x80\x99s life, or, at least, soothe her dying moments.\r\nHer illness overcomes her. She dies. Years roll on. The child becomes\r\na man; and then--and now I will give my imagination a free rein--let\r\nus suppose that the man feels a desire to return to the home of his\r\nchildhood, that he does so, and that he meets there certain people who\r\nsuspect and accuse his mother.... do you realize the sorrow and anguish\r\nof such an interview in the very house wherein the original drama was\r\nplayed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words seemed to echo for a few seconds in the ensuing silence,\r\nand one could read upon the faces of the Count and Countess de Dreux a\r\nbewildered effort to comprehend his meaning and, at the same time, the\r\nfear and anguish of such a comprehension. The count spoke at last, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? The chevalier Floriani, whom you met at Palermo, and whom you have\r\nbeen gracious enough to invite to your house on several occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what does this story mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! nothing at all! It is simply a pastime, so far as I am concerned. I\r\nendeavor to depict the pleasure that Henriette\xe2\x80\x99s son, if he still lives,\r\nwould have in telling you that he was the guilty party, and that he did\r\nit because his mother was unhappy, as she was on the point of losing\r\nthe place of a.... servant, by which she lived, and because the child\r\nsuffered at sight of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with suppressed emotion, rose partially and inclined toward\r\nthe countess. There could be no doubt that the chevalier Floriani was\r\nHenriette\xe2\x80\x99s son. His attitude and words proclaimed it. Besides, was it\r\nnot his obvious intention and desire to be recognized as such?\r\n\r\nThe count hesitated. What action would he take against the audacious\r\nguest? Ring? Provoke a scandal? Unmask the man who had once robbed him?\r\nBut that was a long time ago! And who would believe that absurd story\r\nabout the guilty child? No; better far to accept the situation, and\r\npretend not to comprehend the true meaning of it. So the count, turning\r\nto Floriani, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour story is very curious, very entertaining; I enjoyed it much. But\r\nwhat do you think has become of this young man, this model son? I\r\nhope he has not abandoned the career in which he made such a brilliant\r\nd\xc3\xa9but.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! certainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter such a d\xc3\xa9but! To steal the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace at six years of age;\r\nthe celebrated necklace that was coveted by Marie-Antoinette!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to steal it,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Floriani, falling in with the count\xe2\x80\x99s mood,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwithout costing him the slightest trouble, without anyone thinking to\r\nexamine the condition of the window, or to observe that the window-sill\r\nwas too clean--that window-sill which he had wiped in order to efface\r\nthe marks he had made in the thick dust. We must admit that it was\r\nsufficient to turn the head of a boy at that age. It was all so easy. He\r\nhad simply to desire the thing, and reach out his hand to get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he reached out his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth hands,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the chevalier, laughing.\r\n\r\nHis companions received a shock. What mystery surrounded the life of\r\nthe so-called Floriani? How wonderful must have been the life of that\r\nadventurer, a thief at six years of age, and who, to-day, in search of\r\nexcitement or, at most, to gratify a feeling of resentment, had come to\r\nbrave his victim in her own house, audaciously, foolishly, and yet with\r\nall the grace and delicacy of a courteous guest!\r\n\r\nHe arose and approached the countess to bid her adieu. She recoiled,\r\nunconsciously. He smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Madame, you are afraid of me! Did I pursue my role of\r\nparlor-magician a step too far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe controlled herself, and replied, with her accustomed ease:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, monsieur. The legend of that dutiful son interested me very\r\nmuch, and I am pleased to know that my necklace had such a brilliant\r\ndestiny. But do you not think that the son of that woman, that\r\nHenriette, was the victim of hereditary influence in the choice of his\r\nvocation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, feeling the point, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it; and, moreover, his natural tendency to crime must have\r\nbeen very strong or he would have been discouraged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, as you must know, the majority of the diamonds were false. The\r\nonly genuine stones were the few purchased from the English jeweler, the\r\nothers having been sold, one by one, to meet the cruel necessities of\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was still the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the countess,\r\nhaughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is something that he, Henriette\xe2\x80\x99s son, could not\r\nappreciate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was able to appreciate, madame, that, whether true or false,\r\nthe necklace was nothing more that an object of parade, an emblem of\r\nsenseless pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe count made a threatening gesture, but his wife stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif the man to whom you allude has the slightest\r\nsense of honor---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, intimidated by Floriani\xe2\x80\x99s cool manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that man has the slightest sense of honor,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe felt that she would not gain anything by speaking to him in that\r\nmanner, and in spite of her anger and indignation, trembling as she was\r\nfrom humiliated pride, she said to him, almost politely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, the legend says that R\xc3\xa9taux de Villette, when in possession\r\nof the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace, did not disfigure the mounting. He understood\r\nthat the diamonds were simply the ornament, the accessory, and that\r\nthe mounting was the essential work, the creation of the artist, and\r\nhe respected it accordingly. Do you think that this man had the same\r\nfeeling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt that the mounting still exists. The child respected\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, if you should happen to meet him, will you tell him\r\nthat he unjustly keeps possession of a relic that is the property and\r\npride of a certain family, and that, although the stones have\r\nbeen removed, the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s necklace still belongs to the house of\r\nDreux-Soubise. It belongs to us as much as our name or our honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chevalier replied, simply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall tell him, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed to her, saluted the count and the other guests, and departed.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nFour days later, the countess de Dreux found upon the table in her\r\nchamber a red leather case bearing the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s arms. She opened it,\r\nand found the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace.\r\n\r\nBut as all things must, in the life of a man who strives for unity and\r\nlogic, converge toward the same goal--and as a little advertising never\r\ndoes any harm--on the following day, the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France\xe2\x80\x99 published\r\nthese sensational lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Necklace, the famous historical jewelry stolen from\r\nthe family of Dreux-Soubise, has been recovered by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, who\r\nhastened to restore it to its rightful owner. We cannot too highly\r\ncommend such a delicate and chivalrous act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Seven of Hearts\r\n\r\n\r\nI am frequently asked this question: \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you make the acquaintance\r\nof Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy connection with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was well known. The details that I\r\ngather concerning that mysterious man, the irrefutable facts that I\r\npresent, the new evidence that I produce, the interpretation that I\r\nplace on certain acts of which the public has seen only the exterior\r\nmanifestations without being able to discover the secret reasons or\r\nthe invisible mechanism, all establish, if not an intimacy, at least\r\namicable relations and regular confidences.\r\n\r\nBut how did I make his acquaintance? Why was I selected to be his\r\nhistoriographer? Why I, and not some one else?\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple: chance alone presided over my choice; my merit was\r\nnot considered. It was chance that put me in his way. It was by chance\r\nthat I was participant in one of his strangest and most mysterious\r\nadventures; and by chance that I was an actor in a drama of which he was\r\nthe marvelous stage director; an obscure and intricate drama, bristling\r\nwith such thrilling events that I feel a certain embarrassment in\r\nundertaking to describe it.\r\n\r\nThe first act takes place during that memorable night of 22 June, of\r\nwhich so much has already been said. And, for my part, I attribute the\r\nanomalous conduct of which I was guilty on that occasion to the unusual\r\nframe of mind in which I found myself on my return home. I had dined\r\nwith some friends at the Cascade restaurant, and, the entire evening,\r\nwhilst we smoked and the orchestra played melancholy waltzes, we talked\r\nonly of crimes and thefts, and dark and frightful intrigues. That is\r\nalways a poor overture to a night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Saint-Martins went away in an automobile. Jean Daspry--that\r\ndelightful, heedless Daspry who, six months later, was killed in such a\r\ntragic manner on the frontier of Morocco--Jean Daspry and I returned\r\non foot through the dark, warm night. When we arrived in front of\r\nthe little house in which I had lived for a year at Neuilly, on the\r\nboulevard Maillot, he said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this house is so isolated.... no neighbors.... vacant lots....Really,\r\nI am not a coward, and yet---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are very cheering, I must say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I say that as I would say anything else. The Saint-Martins have\r\nimpressed me with their stories of brigands and thieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands and said good-night. I took out my key and opened the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is good,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cAntoine has forgotten to light a\r\ncandle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I recalled the fact that Antoine was away; I had given him a\r\nshort leave of absence. Forthwith, I was disagreeably oppressed by the\r\ndarkness and silence of the night. I ascended the stairs on tiptoe,\r\nand reached my room as quickly as possible; then, contrary to my usual\r\nhabit, I turned the key and pushed the bolt.\r\n\r\nThe light of my candle restored my courage. Yet I was careful to take my\r\nrevolver from its case--a large, powerful weapon--and place it beside\r\nmy bed. That precaution completed my reassurance. I laid down and, as\r\nusual, took a book from my night-table to read myself to sleep. Then I\r\nreceived a great surprise. Instead of the paper-knife with which I had\r\nmarked my place on the preceding, I found an envelope, closed with\r\nfive seals of red wax. I seized it eagerly. It was addressed to me, and\r\nmarked: \xe2\x80\x9cUrgent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA letter! A letter addressed to me! Who could have put it in that place?\r\nNervously, I tore open the envelope, and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the moment you open this letter, whatever happens, whatever you\r\nmay hear, do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise you are doomed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am not a coward, and, quite as well as another, I can face real\r\ndanger, or smile at the visionary perils of imagination. But, let me\r\nrepeat, I was in an anomalous condition of mind, with my nerves set on\r\nedge by the events of the evening. Besides, was there not, in my present\r\nsituation, something startling and mysterious, calculated to disturb the\r\nmost courageous spirit?\r\n\r\nMy feverish fingers clutched the sheet of paper, and I read and re-read\r\nthose threatening words: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise,\r\nyou are doomed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a joke; the work of some cheerful idiot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to laugh--a good loud laugh. Who prevented me? What haunting\r\nfear compressed my throat?\r\n\r\nAt least, I would blow out the candle. No, I could not do it. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\nmove, or you are doomed,\xe2\x80\x9d were the words he had written.\r\n\r\nThese auto-suggestions are frequently more imperious than the most\r\npositive realities; but why should I struggle against them? I had simply\r\nto close my eyes. I did so.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, I heard a slight noise, followed by crackling sounds,\r\nproceeding from a large room used by me as a library. A small room or\r\nantechamber was situated between the library and my bedchamber.\r\n\r\nThe approach of an actual danger greatly excited me, and I felt a desire\r\nto get up, seize my revolver, and rush into the library. I did not rise;\r\nI saw one of the curtains of the left window move. There was no doubt\r\nabout it: the curtain had moved. It was still moving. And I saw--oh! I\r\nsaw quite distinctly--in the narrow space between the curtains and the\r\nwindow, a human form; a bulky mass that prevented the curtains from\r\nhanging straight. And it is equally certain that the man saw me through\r\nthe large meshes of the curtain. Then, I understood the situation.\r\nHis mission was to guard me while the others carried away their booty.\r\nShould I rise and seize my revolver? Impossible! He was there! At the\r\nleast movement, at the least cry, I was doomed.\r\n\r\nThen came a terrific noise that shook the house; this was followed\r\nby lighter sounds, two or three together, like those of a hammer that\r\nrebounded. At least, that was the impression formed in my confused\r\nbrain. These were mingled with other sounds, thus creating a veritable\r\nuproar which proved that the intruders were not only bold, but felt\r\nthemselves secure from interruption.\r\n\r\nThey were right. I did not move. Was it cowardice? No, rather weakness,\r\na total inability to move any portion of my body, combined with\r\ndiscretion; for why should I struggle? Behind that man, there were ten\r\nothers who would come to his assistance. Should I risk my life to save a\r\nfew tapestries and bibelots?\r\n\r\nThroughout the night, my torture endured. Insufferable torture, terrible\r\nanguish! The noises had stopped, but I was in constant fear of their\r\nrenewal. And the man! The man who was guarding me, weapon in hand. My\r\nfearful eyes remained cast in his direction. And my heart beat! And a\r\nprofuse perspiration oozed from every pore of my body!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I experienced an immense relief; a milk-wagon, whose sound was\r\nfamiliar to me, passed along the boulevard; and, at the same time, I had\r\nan impression that the light of a new day was trying to steal through\r\nthe closed window-blinds.\r\n\r\nAt last, daylight penetrated the room; other vehicles passed along the\r\nboulevard; and all the phantoms of the night vanished. Then I put one\r\narm out of the bed, slowly and cautiously. My eyes were fixed upon the\r\ncurtain, locating the exact spot at which I must fire; I made an exact\r\ncalculation of the movements I must make; then, quickly, I seized my\r\nrevolver and fired.\r\n\r\nI leaped from my bed with a cry of deliverance, and rushed to the\r\nwindow. The bullet had passed through the curtain and the window-glass,\r\nbut it had not touched the man--for the very good reason that there was\r\nnone there. Nobody! Thus, during the entire night, I had been\r\nhypnotized by a fold of the curtain. And, during that time, the\r\nmalefactors....Furiously, with an enthusiasm that nothing could have\r\nstopped, I turned the key, opened the door, crossed the antechamber,\r\nopened another door, and rushed into the library. But amazement stopped\r\nme on the threshold, panting, astounded, more astonished than I had\r\nbeen by the absence of the man. All the things that I supposed had been\r\nstolen, furniture, books, pictures, old tapestries, everything was in\r\nits proper place.\r\n\r\nIt was incredible. I could not believe my eyes. Notwithstanding that\r\nuproar, those noises of removal....I made a tour, I inspected the walls,\r\nI made a mental inventory of all the familiar objects. Nothing was\r\nmissing. And, what was more disconcerting, there was no clue to the\r\nintruders, not a sign, not a chair disturbed, not the trace of a\r\nfootstep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Well!\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, pressing my hands on my bewildered head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csurely I am not crazy! I heard something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInch by inch, I made a careful examination of the room. It was in vain.\r\nUnless I could consider this as a discovery: Under a small Persian rug,\r\nI found a card--an ordinary playing card. It was the seven of hearts;\r\nit was like any other seven of hearts in French playing-cards, with this\r\nslight but curious exception: The extreme point of each of the seven red\r\nspots or hearts was pierced by a hole, round and regular as if made with\r\nthe point of an awl.\r\n\r\nNothing more. A card and a letter found in a book. But was not that\r\nsufficient to affirm that I had not been the plaything of a dream?\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThroughout the day, I continued my searches in the library. It was a\r\nlarge room, much too large for the requirements of such a house, and the\r\ndecoration of which attested the bizarre taste of its founder. The\r\nfloor was a mosaic of multicolored stones, formed into large symmetrical\r\ndesigns. The walls were covered with a similar mosaic, arranged in\r\npanels, Pompeiian allegories, Byzantine compositions, frescoes of the\r\nMiddle Ages. A Bacchus bestriding a cask. An emperor wearing a gold\r\ncrown, a flowing beard, and holding a sword in his right hand.\r\n\r\nQuite high, after the style of an artist\xe2\x80\x99s studio, there was a large\r\nwindow--the only one in the room. That window being always open at\r\nnight, it was probable that the men had entered through it, by the aid\r\nof a ladder. But, again, there was no evidence. The bottom of the ladder\r\nwould have left some marks in the soft earth beneath the window; but\r\nthere were none. Nor were there any traces of footsteps in any part of\r\nthe yard.\r\n\r\nI had no idea of informing the police, because the facts I had before me\r\nwere so absurd and inconsistent. They would laugh at me. However, as I\r\nwas then a reporter on the staff of the \xe2\x80\x98Gil Blas,\xe2\x80\x99 I wrote a lengthy\r\naccount of my adventure and it was published in the paper on the second\r\nday thereafter. The article attracted some attention, but no one took it\r\nseriously. They regarded it as a work of fiction rather than a story\r\nof real life. The Saint-Martins rallied me. But Daspry, who took an\r\ninterest in such matters, came to see me, made a study of the affair,\r\nbut reached no conclusion.\r\n\r\nA few mornings later, the door-bell rang, and Antoine came to inform\r\nme that a gentleman desired to see me. He would not give his name. I\r\ndirected Antoine to show him up. He was a man of about forty years of\r\nage with a very dark complexion, lively features, and whose correct\r\ndress, slightly frayed, proclaimed a taste that contrasted strangely\r\nwith his rather vulgar manners. Without any preamble, he said to me--in\r\na rough voice that confirmed my suspicion as to his social position:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, whilst in a caf\xc3\xa9, I picked up a copy of the \xe2\x80\x98Gil Blas,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nread your article. It interested me very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to talk to you. Are all the facts related by you quite correct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in that case, I can, perhaps, give you some information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet. First, I must be sure that the facts are exactly as you\r\nhave related them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given you my word. What further proof do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must remain alone in this room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an idea that occurred to me when reading your article. Certain\r\ndetails established an extraordinary coincidence with another case that\r\ncame under my notice. If I am mistaken, I shall say nothing more. And\r\nthe only means of ascertaining the truth is by my remaining in the room\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was at the bottom of this proposition? Later, I recalled that the\r\nman was exceedingly nervous; but, at the same time, although somewhat\r\nastonished, I found nothing particularly abnormal about the man or the\r\nrequest he had made. Moreover, my curiosity was aroused; so I replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. How much time do you require?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! three minutes--not longer. Three minutes from now, I will rejoin\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left the room, and went downstairs. I took out my watch. One minute\r\npassed. Two minutes. Why did I feel so depressed? Why did those moments\r\nseem so solemn and weird? Two minutes and a half....Two minutes and\r\nthree quarters. Then I heard a pistol shot.\r\n\r\nI bounded up the stairs and entered the room. A cry of horror escaped\r\nme. In the middle of the room, the man was lying on his left side,\r\nmotionless. Blood was flowing from a wound in his forehead. Near his\r\nhand was a revolver, still smoking.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to this frightful spectacle, my attention was attracted\r\nby another object. At two feet from the body, upon the floor, I saw\r\na playing-card. It was the seven of hearts. I picked it up. The lower\r\nextremity of each of the seven spots was pierced with a small round\r\nhole.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nA half-hour later, the commissary of police arrived, then the coroner\r\nand the chief of the S\xc3\xbbret\xc3\xa9, Mon. Dudouis. I had been careful not to\r\ntouch the corpse. The preliminary inquiry was very brief, and disclosed\r\nnothing. There were no papers in the pockets of the deceased; no name\r\nupon his clothes; no initial upon his linen; nothing to give any clue\r\nto his identity. The room was in the same perfect order as before. The\r\nfurniture had not been disturbed. Yet this man had not come to my house\r\nsolely for the purpose of killing himself, or because he considered my\r\nplace the most convenient one for his suicide! There must have been a\r\nmotive for his act of despair, and that motive was, no doubt, the result\r\nof some new fact ascertained by him during the three minutes he was\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWhat was that fact? What had he seen? What frightful secret had been\r\nrevealed to him? There was no answer to these questions. But, at the\r\nlast moment, an incident occurred that appeared to us of considerable\r\nimportance. As two policemen were raising the body to place it on a\r\nstretcher, the left hand thus being disturbed, a crumpled card fell from\r\nit. The card bore these words: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorges Andermatt, 37 Rue de Berry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat did that mean? Georges Andermatt was a rich banker in Paris, the\r\nfounder and president of the Metal Exchange which had given such an\r\nimpulse to the metallic industries in France. He lived in princely\r\nstyle; was the possessor of numerous automobiles, coaches, and an\r\nexpensive racing-stable. His social affairs were very select, and Madame\r\nAndermatt was noted for her grace and beauty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan that be the man\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.---------------\r\n\r\nThe chief of the S\xc3\xbbret\xc3\xa9 leaned over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not he. Mon. Andermatt is a thin man, and slightly grey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why this card?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a telephone, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in the vestibule. Come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked in the directory, and then asked for number 415.21.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mon. Andermatt at home?....Please tell him that Mon. Dudouis wished\r\nhim to come at once to 102 Boulevard Maillot. Very important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later, Mon. Andermatt arrived in his automobile. After\r\nthe circumstances had been explained to him, he was taken in to see the\r\ncorpse. He displayed considerable emotion, and spoke, in a low tone, and\r\napparently unwillingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEtienne Varin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.... or, at least, yes.... by sight only. His brother....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! he has a brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Alfred Varin. He came to see me once on some matter of\r\nbusiness....I forget what it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere does he live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two brothers live together--rue de Provence, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know any reason why he should commit suicide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe held a card in his hand. It was your card with your address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand that. It must have been there by some chance that\r\nwill be disclosed by the investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA very strange chance, I thought; and I felt that the others entertained\r\nthe same impression.\r\n\r\nI discovered the same impression in the papers next day, and amongst\r\nall my friends with whom I discussed the affair. Amid the mysteries that\r\nenveloped it, after the double discovery of the seven of hearts pierced\r\nwith seven holes, after the two inscrutable events that had happened in\r\nmy house, that visiting card promised to throw some light on the\r\naffair. Through it, the truth may be revealed. But, contrary to our\r\nexpectations, Mon. Andermatt furnished no explanation. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you all I know. What more can I do? I am greatly surprised\r\nthat my card should be found in such a place, and I sincerely hope the\r\npoint will be cleared up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not. The official investigation established that the Varin\r\nbrothers were of Swiss origin, had led a shifting life under various\r\nnames, frequenting gambling resorts, associating with a band of\r\nforeigners who had been dispersed by the police after a series of\r\nrobberies in which their participation was established only by their\r\nflight. At number 24 rue de Provence, where the Varin brothers had lived\r\nsix years before, no one knew what had become of them.\r\n\r\nI confess that, for my part, the case seemed to me so complicated and so\r\nmysterious that I did not think the problem would ever be solved, so\r\nI concluded to waste no more time upon it. But Jean Daspry, whom I\r\nfrequently met at that period, became more and more interested in it\r\neach day. It was he who pointed out to me that item from a foreign\r\nnewspaper which was reproduced and commented upon by the entire press.\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first trial of a new model of submarine boat, which is expected\r\nto revolutionize naval warfare, will be given in presence of the former\r\nEmperor at a place that will be kept secret until the last minute. An\r\nindiscretion has revealed its name; it is called \xe2\x80\x98The Seven-of-Hearts.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Seven-of-Hearts! That presented a new problem. Could a connection be\r\nestablished between the name of the sub-marine and the incidents which\r\nwe have related? But a connection of what nature? What had happened here\r\ncould have no possible relation with the sub-marine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Daspry to me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most diverse\r\neffects often proceed from the same cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the following foreign news item was received and\r\npublished:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is said that the plans of the new sub-marine \xe2\x80\x98Seven-of-Hearts\xe2\x80\x99 were\r\nprepared by French engineers, who, having sought, in vain, the support\r\nof their compatriots, subsequently entered into negotiations with the\r\nBritish Admiralty, without success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not wish to give undue publicity to certain delicate matters which\r\nonce provoked considerable excitement. Yet, since all danger of injury\r\ntherefrom has now come to an end, I must speak of the article that\r\nappeared in the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France,\xe2\x80\x99 which aroused so much comment at\r\nthat time, and which threw considerable light upon the mystery of\r\nthe Seven-of-Hearts. This is the article as it was published over the\r\nsignature of Salvator:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cTHE AFFAIR OF THE SEVEN-OF-HEARTS.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cA CORNER OF THE VEIL RAISED.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe will be brief.  Ten years ago, a young mining engineer, Louis\r\n  Lacombe, wishing to devote his time and fortune to certain studies,\r\n  resigned his position he then held, and rented number 102 boulevard\r\n  Maillot, a small house that had been recently built and decorated\r\n  for an Italian count.  Through the agency of the Varin brothers of\r\n  Lausanne, one of whom assisted in the preliminary experiments and\r\n  the other acted as financial agent, the young engineer was\r\n  introduced to Georges Andermatt, the founder of the Metal Exchange.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAfter several interviews, he succeeded in interesting the banker\r\n  in a sub-marine boat on which he was working, and it was agreed\r\n  that as soon as the invention was perfected, Mon. Andermatt would\r\n  use his influence with the Minister of Marine to obtain a series of\r\n  trials under the direction of the government.  For two years, Louis\r\n  Lacombe was a frequent visitor at Andermatt\xe2\x80\x99s house, and he\r\n  submitted to the banker the various improvements he made upon his\r\n  original plans, until one day, being satisfied with the perfection\r\n  of his work, he asked Mon. Andermatt to communicate with the\r\n  Minister of Marine.  That day, Louis Lacombe dined at Mon.\r\n  Andermatt\xe2\x80\x99s house.  He left there about half-past eleven at night.\r\n  He has not been seen since.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cA perusal of the newspapers of that date will show that the\r\n  young man\xe2\x80\x99s family caused every possible inquiry to be made, but\r\n  without success; and it was the general opinion that Louis Lacombe--\r\n  who was known as an original and visionary youth--had quietly left\r\n  for parts unknown.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cLet us accept that theory--improbable, though it be,--and let us\r\n  consider another question, which is a most important one for our\r\n  country:  What has become of the plans of the sub-marine? Did Louis\r\n  Lacombe carry them away?  Are they destroyed?\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAfter making a thorough investigation, we are able to assert,\r\n  positively, that the plans are in existence, and are now in the\r\n  possession of the two brothers Varin.  How did they acquire such a\r\n  possession?  That is a question not yet determined; nor do we know\r\n  why they have not tried to sell them at an earlier date.  Did they\r\n  fear that their title to them would be called in question?  If so,\r\n  they have lost that fear, and we can announce definitely, that the\r\n  plans of Louis Lacombe are now the property of foreign power, and\r\n  we are in a position to publish the correspondence that passed\r\n  between the Varin brothers and the representative of that power.\r\n  The \xe2\x80\x98Seven-of-Hearts\xe2\x80\x99 invented by Louis Lacombe has been actually\r\n  constructed by our neighbor.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cWill the invention fulfill the optimistic expectations of those\r\n  who were concerned in that treacherous act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a post-script adds:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cLater.--Our special correspondent informs us that the preliminary\r\n  trial of the \xe2\x80\x98Seven-of-Hearts\xe2\x80\x99 has not been satisfactory.  It is\r\n  quite likely that the plans sold and delivered by the Varin\r\n  brothers did not include the final document carried by Louis\r\n  Lacombe to Mon. Andermatt on the day of his disappearance, a\r\n  document that was indispensable to a thorough understanding of the\r\n  invention.  It contained a summary of the final conclusions of the\r\n  inventor, and estimates and figures not contained in the other\r\n  papers.  Without this document, the plans are incomplete; on the\r\n  other hand, without the plans, the document is worthless.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cNow is the time to act and recover what belongs to us.  It may\r\n  be a difficult matter, but we rely upon the assistance of Mon.\r\n  Andermatt.  It will be to his interest to explain his conduct which\r\n  has hitherto been so strange and inscrutable.  He will explain not\r\n  only why he concealed these facts at the time of the suicide of\r\n  Etienne Varin, but also why he has never revealed the disappearance\r\n  of the paper--a fact well known to him.  He will tell why, during\r\n  the last six years, he paid spies to watch the movements of the\r\n  Varin brothers.  We expect from him, not only words, but acts.  And\r\n  at once.  Otherwise---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe threat was plainly expressed. But of what did it consist? What whip\r\nwas Salvator, the anonymous writer of the article, holding over the head\r\nof Mon. Andermatt?\r\n\r\nAn army of reporters attacked the banker, and ten interviewers announced\r\nthe scornful manner in which they were treated. Thereupon, the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de\r\nFrance\xe2\x80\x99 announced its position in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether Mon. Andermatt is willing or not, he will be, henceforth, our\r\ncollaborator in the work we have undertaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nDaspry and I were dining together on the day on which that announcement\r\nappeared. That evening, with the newspapers spread over my table, we\r\ndiscussed the affair and examined it from every point of view with that\r\nexasperation that a person feels when walking in the dark and finding\r\nhimself constantly falling over the same obstacles. Suddenly, without\r\nany warning whatsoever, the door opened and a lady entered. Her face was\r\nhidden behind a thick veil. I rose at once and approached her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, monsieur, who lives here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame, but I do not understand---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gate was not locked,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the vestibule door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, and it occurred to me that she had used the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nentrance. How did she know the way? Then there was a silence that was\r\nquite embarrassing. She looked at Daspry, and I was obliged to introduce\r\nhim. I asked her to be seated and explain the object of her visit. She\r\nraised her veil, and I saw that she was a brunette with regular features\r\nand, though not handsome, she was attractive--principally, on account of\r\nher sad, dark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Madame Andermatt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Andermatt!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, with astonishment.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause, she continued with a voice and manner that were\r\nquite easy and natural:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to see you about that affair--you know. I thought I might\r\nbe able to obtain some information---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, madame, I know nothing but what has already appeared in the\r\npapers. But if you will point out in what way I can help you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know....I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot until then did I suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed, and\r\nthat some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of tranquility.\r\nFor a moment, we were silent and embarrassed. Then Daspry stepped\r\nforward, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you permit me to ask you a few questions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI will answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will answer.... whatever those questions may be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know Louis Lacombe?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, through my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you see him for the last time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe evening he dined with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time, was there anything to lead you to believe that you would\r\nnever see him again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But he had spoken of a trip to Russia--in a vague way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you expected to see him again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He was to dine with us, two days later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you explain his disappearance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mon. Andermatt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet the article published in the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France\xe2\x80\x99 indicates---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that the Varin brothers had something to do with his\r\ndisappearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what do you base your opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he left our house, Louis Lacombe carried a satchel containing all\r\nthe papers relating to his invention. Two days later, my husband, in\r\na conversation with one of the Varin brothers, learned that the papers\r\nwere in their possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he did not denounce them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there was something else in the satchel--something besides the\r\npapers of Louis Lacombe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated; was on the point of speaking, but, finally, remained\r\nsilent. Daspry continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over their\r\nmovements instead of informing the police. He hoped to recover the\r\npapers and, at the same time, that compromising article which has\r\nenabled the two brothers to hold over him threats of exposure and\r\nblackmail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver him, and over me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! over you, also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver me, in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered the last words in a hollow voice. Daspry observed it; he\r\npaced to and fro for a moment, then, turning to her, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you written to Louis Lacombe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. My husband had business with him--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApart from those business letters, had you written to Louis\r\nLacombe.... other letters? Excuse my insistence, but it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that I should know the truth. Did you write other letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd those letters came into the possession of the Varin brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Mon. Andermatt know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not seen them, but Alfred Varin has told him of their existence\r\nand threatened to publish them if my husband should take any steps\r\nagainst him. My husband was afraid.... of a scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he has tried to recover the letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so; but I do not know. You see, after that last interview with\r\nAlfred Varin, and after some harsh words between me and my husband in\r\nwhich he called me to account--we live as strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, as you have nothing to lose, what do you fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be indifferent to him now, but I am the woman that he has loved,\r\nthe one he would still love--oh! I am quite sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured,\r\nin a fervent voice, \xe2\x80\x9che would still love me if he had not got hold of\r\nthose cursed letters----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Did he succeed?....But the two brothers still defied him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and they boasted of having a secure hiding-place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe my husband discovered that hiding-place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! where was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried in alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I always had that suspicion. Louis Lacombe was very ingenious\r\nand amused himself in his leisure hours, by making safes and locks. No\r\ndoubt, the Varin brothers were aware of that fact and utilized one of\r\nLacombe\xe2\x80\x99s safes in which to conceal the letters.... and other things,\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they did not live here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you came, four months ago, the house had been vacant for some\r\ntime. And they may have thought that your presence here would not\r\ninterfere with them when they wanted to get the papers. But they did not\r\ncount on my husband, who came here on the night of 22 June, forced the\r\nsafe, took what he was seeking, and left his card to inform the two\r\nbrothers that he feared them no more, and that their positions were now\r\nreversed. Two days later, after reading the article in the \xe2\x80\x98Gil Blas,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nEtienne Varin came here, remained alone in this room, found the safe\r\nempty, and.... killed himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Daspry said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very simple theory....Has Mon. Andermatt spoken to you since then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas his attitude toward you changed in any way? Does he appear more\r\ngloomy, more anxious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed any change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you think he has secured the letters. Now, in my opinion, he\r\nhas not got those letters, and it was not he who came here on the night\r\nof 22 June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mysterious individual who is managing this affair, who holds all\r\nthe threads in his hands, and whose invisible but far-reaching power we\r\nhave felt from the beginning. It was he and his friends who entered\r\nthis house on 22 June; it was he who discovered the hiding-place of the\r\npapers; it was he who left Mon. Andermatt\xe2\x80\x99s card; it is he who now\r\nholds the correspondence and the evidence of the treachery of the Varin\r\nbrothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who writes letters to the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France\xe2\x80\x99.... Salvator! Have\r\nwe not convincing evidence of that fact? Does he not mention in his\r\nletters certain details that no one could know, except the man who had\r\nthus discovered the secrets of the two brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Madame Andermatt, in great alarm, \xe2\x80\x9che has my\r\nletters also, and it is he who now threatens my husband. Mon Dieu! What\r\nam I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite to him,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Daspry. \xe2\x80\x9cConfide in him without reserve. Tell\r\nhim all you know and all you may hereafter learn. Your interest and his\r\ninterest are the same. He is not working against Mon. Andermatt, but\r\nagainst Alfred Varin. Help him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your husband the document that completes the plans of Louis\r\nLacombe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell that to Salvator, and, if possible, procure the document for him.\r\nWrite to him at once. You risk nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe advice was bold, dangerous even at first sight, but Madame Andermatt\r\nhad no choice. Besides, as Daspry had said, she ran no risk. If\r\nthe unknown writer were an enemy, that step would not aggravate the\r\nsituation. If he were a stranger seeking to accomplish a particular\r\npurpose, he would attach to those letters only a secondary importance.\r\nWhatever might happen, it was the only solution offered to her, and\r\nshe, in her anxiety, was only too glad to act on it. She thanked us\r\neffusively, and promised to keep us informed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, two days later, she sent us the following letter that she had\r\nreceived from Salvator:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave not found the letters, but I will get them. Rest easy. I am\r\nwatching everything. S.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at the letter. It was in the same handwriting as the note I\r\nfound in my book on the night of 22 June.\r\n\r\nDaspry was right. Salvator was, indeed, the originator of that affair.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nWe were beginning to see a little light coming out of the darkness that\r\nsurrounded us, and an unexpected light was thrown on certain points; but\r\nother points yet remained obscure--for instance, the finding of the two\r\nseven-of-hearts. Perhaps I was unnecessarily concerned about those\r\ntwo cards whose seven punctured spots had appeared to me under such\r\nstartling circumstances! Yet I could not refrain from asking myself:\r\nWhat role will they play in the drama? What importance do they\r\nbear? What conclusion must be drawn from the fact that the submarine\r\nconstructed from the plans of Louis Lacombe bore the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seven-of-Hearts\xe2\x80\x99?\r\n\r\nDaspry gave little thought to the other two cards; he devoted all his\r\nattention to another problem which he considered more urgent; he was\r\nseeking the famous hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI may find the letters that Salvator did not\r\nfind--by inadvertence, perhaps. It is improbable that the Varin brothers\r\nwould have removed from a spot, which they deemed inaccessible, the\r\nweapon which was so valuable to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he continued to search. In a short time, the large room held no more\r\nsecrets for him, so he extended his investigations to the other rooms.\r\nHe examined the interior and the exterior, the stones of the foundation,\r\nthe bricks in the walls; he raised the slates of the roof.\r\n\r\nOne day, he came with a pickaxe and a spade, gave me the spade, kept the\r\npickaxe, pointed to the adjacent vacant lots, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cCome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed him, but I lacked his enthusiasm. He divided the vacant land\r\ninto several sections which he examined in turn. At last, in a corner,\r\nat the angle formed by the walls of two neighboring proprietors, a small\r\npile of earth and gravel, covered with briers and grass, attracted his\r\nattention. He attacked it. I was obliged to help him. For an hour, under\r\na hot sun, we labored without success. I was discouraged, but Daspry\r\nurged me on. His ardor was as strong as ever.\r\n\r\nAt last, Daspry\xe2\x80\x99s pickaxe unearthed some bones--the remains of a\r\nskeleton to which some scraps of clothing still hung. Suddenly, I turned\r\npale. I had discovered, sticking in the earth, a small piece of iron cut\r\nin the form of a rectangle, on which I thought I could see red spots. I\r\nstooped and picked it up. That little iron plate was the exact size of a\r\nplaying-card, and the red spots, made with red lead, were arranged upon\r\nit in a manner similar to the seven-of-hearts, and each spot was pierced\r\nwith a round hole similar to the perforations in the two playing cards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Daspry, I have had enough of this. You can stay if it interests\r\nyou. But I am going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas that simply the expression of my excited nerves? Or was it the\r\nresult of a laborious task executed under a burning sun? I know that\r\nI trembled as I walked away, and that I went to bed, where I remained\r\nforty-eight hours, restless and feverish, haunted by skeletons that\r\ndanced around me and threw their bleeding hearts at my head.\r\n\r\nDaspry was faithful to me. He came to my house every day, and remained\r\nthree or four hours, which he spent in the large room, ferreting,\r\nthumping, tapping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters are here, in this room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, from time to time, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nare here. I will stake my life on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third day I arose--feeble yet, but cured. A\r\nsubstantial breakfast cheered me up. But a letter that I received that\r\nafternoon contributed, more than anything else, to my complete recovery,\r\nand aroused in me a lively curiosity. This was the letter:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThe drama, the first act of which transpired on the night of 22\r\n  June, is now drawing to a close.  Force of circumstances compel me\r\n  to bring the two principal actors in that drama face to face, and I\r\n  wish that meeting to take place in your house, if you will be so\r\n  kind as to give me the use of it for this evening from nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\n  to eleven.  It will be advisable to give your servant leave of\r\n  absence for the evening, and, perhaps, you will be so kind as to\r\n  leave the field open to the two adversaries.  You will remember\r\n  that when I visited your house on the night of 22 June, I took\r\n  excellent care of your property.  I feel that I would do you an\r\n  injustice if I should doubt, for one moment, your absolute\r\n  discretion in this affair.  Your devoted,\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x9cSALVATOR.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at the\r\nwhimsical nature of his request. There was a charming display of\r\nconfidence and candor in his language, and nothing in the world could\r\nhave induced me to deceive him or repay his confidence with ingratitude.\r\n\r\nI gave my servant a theatre ticket, and he left the house at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. A few minutes later, Daspry arrived. I showed him the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have left the garden gate unlocked, so anyone can enter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you--are you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I intend to stay right here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he asks you to go---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not going. I will be discreet, but I am resolved to see what\r\ntakes place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa foi!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Daspry, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right, and I shall stay\r\nwith you. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to miss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were interrupted by the sound of the door-bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere already?\xe2\x80\x9d said Daspry, \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty minutes ahead of time! Incredible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went to the door and ushered in the visitor. It was Madame Andermatt.\r\nShe was faint and nervous, and in a stammering voice, she ejaculated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband.... is coming.... he has an appointment.... they intend to\r\ngive him the letters....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy chance. A message came for my husband while we were at dinner. The\r\nservant gave it to me by mistake. My husband grabbed it quickly, but he\r\nwas too late. I had read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It was something like this: \xe2\x80\x98At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock this evening, be\r\nat Boulevard Maillot with the papers connected with the affair. In\r\nexchange, the letters.\xe2\x80\x99 So, after dinner, I hastened here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnknown to your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think about it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daspry, turning to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think as you do, that Mon. Andermatt is one of the invited guests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but for what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what we are going to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI led them to a large room. The three of us could hide comfortably\r\nbehind the velvet chimney-mantle, and observe all that should happen\r\nin the room. We seated ourselves there, with Madame Andermatt in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck nine. A few minutes later, the garden gate creaked upon\r\nits hinges. I confess that I was greatly agitated. I was about to learn\r\nthe key to the mystery. The startling events of the last few weeks were\r\nabout to be explained, and, under my eyes, the last battle was going to\r\nbe fought. Daspry seized the hand of Madame Andermatt, and said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word, not a movement! Whatever you may see or hear, keep quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome one entered. It was Alfred Varin. I recognized him at once, owing\r\nto the close resemblance he bore to his brother Etienne. There was\r\nthe same slouching gait; the same cadaverous face covered with a black\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nHe entered with the nervous air of a man who is accustomed to fear the\r\npresence of traps and ambushes; who scents and avoids them. He glanced\r\nabout the room, and I had the impression that the chimney, masked with\r\na velvet porti\xc3\xa8re, did not please him. He took three steps in our\r\ndirection, when something caused him to turn and walk toward the old\r\nmosaic king, with the flowing beard and flamboyant sword, which he\r\nexamined minutely, mounting on a chair and following with his fingers\r\nthe outlines of the shoulders and head and feeling certain parts of the\r\nface. Suddenly, he leaped from the chair and walked away from it. He had\r\nheard the sound of approaching footsteps. Mon. Andermatt appeared at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! You!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the banker. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it you who brought me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? By no means,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Varin, in a rough, jerky voice that reminded\r\nme of his brother, \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, it was your letter that brought me\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter signed by you, in which you offered---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never wrote to you,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Mon. Andermatt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not write to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstinctively, Varin was put on his guard, not against the banker, but\r\nagainst the unknown enemy who had drawn him into this trap. A second\r\ntime, he looked in our direction, then walked toward the door. But Mon.\r\nAndermatt barred his passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where are you going, Varin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something about this affair I don\xe2\x80\x99t like. I am going home.\r\nGood evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need of that, Mon. Andermatt. I have nothing to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have something to say to you, and this is a good time to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you will not pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarin recoiled before the resolute attitude of the banker, as he\r\nmuttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, be quick about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne thing astonished me; and I have no doubt my two companions\r\nexperienced a similar feeling. Why was Salvator not there? Was he not a\r\nnecessary party at this conference? Or was he satisfied to let these two\r\nadversaries fight it out between themselves? At all events, his absence\r\nwas a great disappointment, although it did not detract from the\r\ndramatic strength of the situation.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Mon. Andermatt approached Varin and, face to face, eye\r\nto eye, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, after all these years and when you have nothing more to fear, you\r\ncan answer me candidly: What have you done with Louis Lacombe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a question! As if I knew anything about him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do know! You and your brother were his constant companions, almost\r\nlived with him in this very house. You knew all about his plans and his\r\nwork. And the last night I ever saw Louis Lacombe, when I parted with\r\nhim at my door, I saw two men slinking away in the shadows of the trees.\r\nThat, I am ready to swear to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what has that to do with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two men were you and your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best proof is that, two days later, you yourself showed me the\r\npapers and the plans that belonged to Lacombe and offered to sell them.\r\nHow did these papers come into your possession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told you, Mon. Andermatt, that we found them on Louis\r\nLacombe\xe2\x80\x99s table, the morning after his disappearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law will prove it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not appeal to the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Ah! Why---,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the banker, with a slight display of\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know very well, Mon. Andermatt, if you had the least certainty of\r\nour guilt, our little threat would not have stopped you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat threat? Those letters? Do you suppose I ever gave those letters a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s thought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you did not care for the letters, why did you offer me thousands of\r\nfrancs for their return? And why did you have my brother and me tracked\r\nlike wild beasts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo recover the plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! You wanted the letters. You knew that as soon as you had the\r\nletters in your possession, you could denounce us. Oh! no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npart with them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed heartily, but stopped suddenly, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, enough of this! We are merely going over old ground. We make no\r\nheadway. We had better let things stand as they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not let them stand as they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cand since\r\nyou have referred to the letters, let me tell you that you will not\r\nleave this house until you deliver up those letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go when I please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, Mon. Andermatt. I warn you---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you shall not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see about that,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Varin, in such a rage that Madame\r\nAndermatt could not suppress a cry of fear. Varin must have heard it,\r\nfor he now tried to force his way out. Mon. Andermatt pushed him back.\r\nThen I saw him put his hand into his coat pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time, let me pass,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters, first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarin drew a revolver and, pointing it at Mon. Andermatt, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker stooped quickly. There was the sound of a pistol-shot. The\r\nweapon fell from Varin\xe2\x80\x99s hand. I was amazed. The shot was fired close\r\nto me. It was Daspry who had fired it at Varin, causing him to drop the\r\nrevolver. In a moment, Daspry was standing between the two men, facing\r\nVarin; he said to him, with a sneer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were lucky, my friend, very lucky. I fired at your hand and struck\r\nonly the revolver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth of them looked at him, surprised. Then he turned to the banker, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, monsieur, for meddling in your business; but,\r\nreally, you play a very poor game. Let me hold the cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning again to Varin, Daspry said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s between us two, comrade, and play fair, if you please. Hearts are\r\ntrumps, and I play the seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Daspry held up, before Varin\xe2\x80\x99s bewildered eyes, the little iron\r\nplate, marked with the seven red spots. It was a terrible shock to\r\nVarin. With livid features, staring eyes, and an air of intense agony,\r\nthe man seemed to be hypnotized at the sight of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne who meddles in other people\xe2\x80\x99s business, down to the very bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you brought here tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI brought nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did, or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come. This morning, you received\r\nan invitation to come here at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and bring with you all the\r\npapers held by you. You are here. Where are the papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was in Daspry\xe2\x80\x99s voice and manner a tone of authority that I did\r\nnot understand; his manner was usually quite mild and conciliatory.\r\nAbsolutely conquered, Varin placed his hand on one of his pockets, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe papers are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that you took from Louis Lacombe and afterwards sold to Major von\r\nLieben?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these the copies or the originals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the originals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you want for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred thousand francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daspry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the major gave you only twenty\r\nthousand, and that was like money thrown into the sea, as the boat was a\r\nfailure at the preliminary trials.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe plans are not complete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, why do you ask me for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I want them. I offer you five thousand francs--not a sou more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand. Not a sou less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daspry, who now turned to Mon. Andermatt, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur will kindly sign a check for the amount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut....I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour check-book? Here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAstounded, Mon. Andermatt examined the check-book that Daspry handed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does that happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo idle words, monsieur, if you please. You have merely to sign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker took out his fountain pen, filled out the check and signed\r\nit. Varin held out his hand for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut down your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daspry, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something more.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, to\r\nthe banker, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked for some letters, did you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a package of letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they, Varin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they, Varin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. My brother had charge of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are hidden in this room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, you know where they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it not you who found the hiding-place? You appear to be as well\r\ninformed.... as Salvator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters are not in the hiding-place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarin looked at him, defiantly. Were not Daspry and Salvator the same\r\nperson? Everything pointed to that conclusion. If so, Varin risked\r\nnothing in disclosing a hiding-place already known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Daspry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not got the seven of hearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daspry, handing him the iron plate. Varin\r\nrecoiled in terror, and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I will not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Daspry, as he walked toward the bearded king,\r\nclimbed on a chair and applied the seven of hearts to the lower part of\r\nthe sword in such a manner that the edges of the iron plate coincided\r\nexactly with the two edges of the sword. Then, with the assistance of\r\nan awl which he introduced alternately into each of the seven holes, he\r\npressed upon seven of the little mosaic stones. As he pressed upon the\r\nseventh one, a clicking sound was heard, and the entire bust of the King\r\nturned upon a pivot, disclosing a large opening lined with steel. It was\r\nreally a fire-proof safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see, Varin, the safe is empty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I see. Then, my brother has taken out the letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaspry stepped down from the chair, approached Varin, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, no more nonsense with me. There is another hiding-place. Where is\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it money you want? How much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Andermatt, are those letters worth ten thousand francs to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, firmly.\r\n\r\nVarin closed the safe, took the seven of hearts and placed it again on\r\nthe sword at the same spot. He thrust the awl into each of the seven\r\nholes. There was the same clicking sound, but this time, strange to\r\nrelate, it was only a portion of the safe that revolved on the pivot,\r\ndisclosing quite a small safe that was built within the door of the\r\nlarger one. The packet of letters was here, tied with a tape, and\r\nsealed. Varin handed the packet to Daspry. The latter turned to the\r\nbanker, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the check ready, Monsieur Andermatt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have also the last document that you received from Louis\r\nLacombe--the one that completes the plans of the sub-marine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exchange was made. Daspry pocketed the document and the checks, and\r\noffered the packet of letters to Mon. Andermatt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what you wanted, Monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe banker hesitated a moment, as if he were afraid to touch those\r\ncursed letters that he had sought so eagerly. Then, with a nervous\r\nmovement, he took them. Close to me, I heard a moan. I grasped Madame\r\nAndermatt\xe2\x80\x99s hand. It was cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daspry to the banker, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our business is\r\nended. Oh! no thanks. It was only by a mere chance that I have been able\r\nto do you a good turn. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMon. Andermatt retired. He carried with him the letters written by his\r\nwife to Louis Lacombe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Daspry, delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is coming our\r\nway. Now, we have only to close our little affair, comrade. You have the\r\npapers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are--all of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaspry examined them carefully, and then placed them in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right. You have kept your word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two checks? The money?\xe2\x80\x9d said Varin, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have a great deal of assurance, my man. How dare you ask such\r\na thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask only what is due to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you ask pay for returning papers that you stole? Well, I think\r\nnot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarin was beside himself. He trembled with rage; his eyes were\r\nbloodshot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money.... the twenty thousand....\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible! I need it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, be reasonable, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get excited. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do you any good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaspry seized his arm so forcibly, that Varin uttered a cry of pain.\r\nDaspry continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you can go. The air will do you good. Perhaps you want me to show\r\nyou the way. Ah! yes, we will go together to the vacant lot near here,\r\nand I will show you a little mound of earth and stones and under it---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is false! That is false!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, it is true. That little iron plate with the seven spots on it\r\ncame from there. Louis Lacombe always carried it, and you buried it with\r\nthe body--and with some other things that will prove very interesting to\r\na judge and jury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarin covered his face with his hands, and muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I am beaten. Say no more. But I want to ask you one\r\nquestion. I should like to know---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there a little casket in the large safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it there on the night of 22 June?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did it contain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything that the Varin brothers had put in it--a very pretty\r\ncollection of diamonds and pearls picked up here and there by the said\r\nbrothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you take it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did. Do you blame me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand.... it was the disappearance of that casket that caused my\r\nbrother to kill himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably. The disappearance of your correspondence was not a sufficient\r\nmotive. But the disappearance of the casket....Is that all you wish to\r\nask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more: your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask that with an idea of seeking revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu! The tables may be turned. Today, you are on top. To-morrow---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so. Your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man staggered, as though stunned by a heavy blow. Those two words\r\nhad deprived him of all hope.\r\n\r\nDaspry laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! did you imagine that a Monsieur Durand or Dupont could manage an\r\naffair like this? No, it required the skill and cunning of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\nAnd now that you have my name, go and prepare your revenge. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nwill wait for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he pushed the bewildered Varin through the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaspry! Daspry!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, pushing aside the curtain. He ran to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Andermatt is ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastened to her, caused her to inhale some salts, and, while caring\r\nfor her, questioned me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters of Louis Lacombe that you gave to her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe struck his forehead and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she think that I could do such a thing!...But, of course she would.\r\nImbecile that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Andermatt was now revived. Daspry took from his pocket a small\r\npackage exactly similar to the one that Mon. Andermatt had carried away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are your letters, Madame. These are the genuine letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut.... the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe others are the same, rewritten by me and carefully worded. Your\r\nhusband will not find anything objectionable in them, and will never\r\nsuspect the substitution since they were taken from the safe in his\r\npresence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the handwriting---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no handwriting that cannot be imitated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thanked him in the same words she might have used to a man in her\r\nown social circle, so I concluded that she had not witnessed the final\r\nscene between Varin and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. But the surprising revelation\r\ncaused me considerable embarrassment. Lupin! My club companion was none\r\nother than Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. I could not realize it. But he said, quite at\r\nhis ease:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can say farewell to Jean Daspry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Jean Daspry is going on a long journey. I shall send him to\r\nMorocco. There, he may find a death worthy of him. I may say that that\r\nis his expectation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin will remain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Decidedly. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is simply at the threshold of his career,\r\nand he expects---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was impelled by curiosity to interrupt him, and, leading him away from\r\nthe hearing of Madame Andermatt, I asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you discover the smaller safe yourself--the one that held the\r\nletters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, after a great deal of trouble. I found it yesterday afternoon\r\nwhile you were asleep. And yet, God knows it was simple enough! But\r\nthe simplest things are the ones that usually escape our notice.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\nshowing me the seven-of-hearts, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I had guessed that,\r\nin order to open the larger safe, this card must be placed on the sword\r\nof the mosaic king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you guess that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite easily. Through private information, I knew that fact when I came\r\nhere on the evening of 22 June---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter you left me---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, after turning the subject of our conversation to stories of crime\r\nand robbery which were sure to reduce you to such a nervous condition\r\nthat you would not leave your bed, but would allow me to complete my\r\nsearch uninterrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe scheme worked perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I knew when I came here that there was a casket concealed in a\r\nsafe with a secret lock, and that the seven-of-hearts was the key\r\nto that lock. I had merely to place the card upon the spot that was\r\nobviously intended for it. An hour\xe2\x80\x99s examination showed me where the\r\nspot was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve the fellow in mosaic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old emperor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat old emperor is an exact representation of the king of hearts on\r\nall playing cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. But how does the seven of hearts open the larger safe at\r\none time and the smaller safe at another time? And why did you open only\r\nthe larger safe in the first instance? I mean on the night of 22 June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because I always placed the seven of hearts in the same way. I\r\nnever changed the position. But, yesterday, I observed that by reversing\r\nthe card, by turning it upside down, the arrangement of the seven spots\r\non the mosaic was changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, parbleu! But a person has to think of those things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something else: you did not know the history of those letters\r\nuntil Madame Andermatt---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoke of them before me? No. Because I found in the safe, besides\r\nthe casket, nothing but the correspondence of the two brothers which\r\ndisclosed their treachery in regard to the plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was by chance that you were led, first, to investigate the\r\nhistory of the two brothers, and then to search for the plans and\r\ndocuments relating to the sub-marine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply by chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose did you make the search?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Daspry, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9chow deeply interested you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe subject fascinates me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, presently, after I have escorted Madame Andermatt to a\r\ncarriage, and dispatched a short story to the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de France,\xe2\x80\x99 I will\r\nreturn and tell you all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down and wrote one of those short, clear-cut articles which\r\nserved to amuse and mystify the public. Who does not recall the\r\nsensation that followed that article produced throughout the entire\r\nworld?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has solved the problem recently submitted by Salvator.\r\nHaving acquired possession of all the documents and original plans\r\nof the engineer Louis Lacombe, he has placed them in the hands of\r\nthe Minister of Marine, and he has headed a subscription list for the\r\npurpose of presenting to the nation the first submarine constructed from\r\nthose plans. His subscription is twenty thousand francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty thousand francs! The checks of Mon. Andermatt?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed,\r\nwhen he had given me the paper to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. It was quite right that Varin should redeem his treachery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. That is how\r\nI learned that Jean Daspry, a member of my club, was none other than\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, gentleman-thief. That is how I formed very agreeable ties\r\nof friendship with that famous man, and, thanks to the confidence\r\nwith which he honored me, how I became his very humble and faithful\r\nhistoriographer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Madame Imbert\xe2\x80\x99s Safe\r\n\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, there were still half a dozen carriages\r\nin front of one of those small houses which form only the side of the\r\nboulevard Berthier. The door of that house opened, and a number of\r\nguests, male and female, emerged. The majority of them entered their\r\ncarriages and were quickly driven away, leaving behind only two men who\r\nwalked down Courcelles, where they parted, as one of them lived in that\r\nstreet. The other decided to return on foot as far as the Porte-Maillot.\r\nIt was a beautiful winter\xe2\x80\x99s night, clear and cold; a night on which a\r\nbrisk walk is agreeable and refreshing.\r\n\r\nBut, at the end of a few minutes, he had the disagreeable impression\r\nthat he was being followed. Turning around, he saw a man skulking amongst\r\nthe trees. He was not a coward; yet he felt it advisable to increase his\r\nspeed. Then his pursuer commenced to run; and he deemed it prudent to\r\ndraw his revolver and face him. But he had no time. The man rushed at\r\nhim and attacked him violently. Immediately, they were engaged in a\r\ndesperate struggle, wherein he felt that his unknown assailant had the\r\nadvantage. He called for help, struggled, and was thrown down on a pile\r\nof gravel, seized by the throat, and gagged with a handkerchief that his\r\nassailant forced into his mouth. His eyes closed, and the man who\r\nwas smothering him with his weight arose to defend himself against an\r\nunexpected attack. A blow from a cane and a kick from a boot; the\r\nman uttered two cries of pain, and fled, limping and cursing. Without\r\ndeigning to pursue the fugitive, the new arrival stooped over the\r\nprostrate man and inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you hurt, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not injured, but he was dazed and unable to stand. His rescuer\r\nprocured a carriage, placed him in it, and accompanied him to his house\r\non the avenue de la Grande-Arm\xc3\xa9e. On his arrival there, quite recovered,\r\nhe overwhelmed his saviour with thanks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe you my life, monsieur, and I shall not forget it. I do not wish\r\nto alarm my wife at this time of night, but, to-morrow, she will be\r\npleased to thank you personally. Come and breakfast with us. My name is\r\nLudovic Imbert. May I ask yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he handed Mon. Imbert a card bearing the name: \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAt that time, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin did not enjoy the celebrity which the Cahorn\r\naffair, his escape from the Prison de la Sant\xc3\xa9, and other brilliant\r\nexploits, afterwards gained for him. He had not even used the name of\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. The name was specially invented to designate the rescuer\r\nof Mon. Imbert; that is to say, it was in that affair that Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin was baptized. Fully armed and ready for the fray, it is true, but\r\nlacking the resources and authority which command success, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nwas then merely an apprentice in a profession wherein he soon became a\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nWith what a thrill of joy he recalled the invitation he received that\r\nnight! At last, he had reached his goal! At last, he had undertaken\r\na task worthy of his strength and skill! The Imbert millions! What a\r\nmagnificent feast for an appetite like his!\r\n\r\nHe prepared a special toilet for the occasion; a shabby frock-coat,\r\nbaggy trousers, a frayed silk hat, well-worn collar and cuffs, all quite\r\ncorrect in form, but bearing the unmistakable stamp of poverty. His\r\ncravat was a black ribbon pinned with a false diamond. Thus accoutred,\r\nhe descended the stairs of the house in which he lived at Montmartre. At\r\nthe third floor, without stopping, he rapped on a closed door with the\r\nhead of his cane. He walked to the exterior boulevards. A tram-car was\r\npassing. He boarded it, and some one who had been following him took a\r\nseat beside him. It was the lodger who occupied the room on the third\r\nfloor. A moment later, this man said to Lupin:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, governor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is all fixed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going there to breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou breakfast--there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Why not? I rescued Mon. Ludovic Imbert from certain death\r\nat your hands. Mon. Imbert is not devoid of gratitude. He invited me to\r\nbreakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence. Then the other said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not going to throw up the scheme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I arranged that little case of assault\r\nand battery, when I took the trouble at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, to\r\nrap you with my cane and tap you with my boot at the risk of injuring\r\nmy only friend, it was not my intention to forego the advantages to be\r\ngained from a rescue so well arranged and executed. Oh! no, not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the strange rumors we hear about their fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about that. For six months, I have worked on this affair,\r\ninvestigated it, studied it, questioned the servants, the money-lenders\r\nand men of straw; for six months, I have shadowed the husband and wife.\r\nConsequently, I know what I am talking about. Whether the fortune came\r\nto them from old Brawford, as they pretend, or from some other source,\r\nI do not care. I know that it is a reality; that it exists. And some day\r\nit will be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBigre! One hundred millions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us say ten, or even five--that is enough! They have a safe full\r\nof bonds, and there will be the devil to pay if I can\xe2\x80\x99t get my hands on\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tram-car stopped at the Place de l\xe2\x80\x99Etoile. The man whispered to\r\nLupin:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, at present. You will hear from me. There is no hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was ascending the magnificent flight\r\nof stairs in the Imbert mansion, and Mon. Imbert introduced him to\r\nhis wife. Madame Gervaise Imbert was a short plump woman, and very\r\ntalkative. She gave Lupin a cordial welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desired that we should be alone to entertain our saviour,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, they treated \xe2\x80\x9cour saviour\xe2\x80\x9d as an old and valued friend.\r\nBy the time dessert was served, their friendship was well cemented, and\r\nprivate confidences were being exchanged. Ars\xc3\xa8ne related the story of\r\nhis life, the life of his father as a magistrate, the sorrows of his\r\nchildhood, and his present difficulties. Gervaise, in turn, spoke of\r\nher youth, her marriage, the kindness of the aged Brawford, the hundred\r\nmillions that she had inherited, the obstacles that prevented her from\r\nobtaining the enjoyment of her inheritance, the moneys she had been\r\nobliged to borrow at an exorbitant rate of interest, her endless\r\ncontentions with Brawford\xe2\x80\x99s nephews, and the litigation! the\r\ninjunctions! in fact, everything!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think of it, Monsieur Lupin, the bonds are there, in my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice, and if we detach a single coupon, we lose everything! They are\r\nthere, in our safe, and we dare not touch them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lupin shivered at the bare idea of his proximity to so much\r\nwealth. Yet he felt quite certain that Monsieur Lupin would never suffer\r\nfrom the same difficulty as his fair hostess who declared she dare not\r\ntouch the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! they are there!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA friendship formed under such circumstances soon led to closer\r\nrelations. When discreetly questioned, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin confessed his\r\npoverty and distress. Immediately, the unfortunate young man was\r\nappointed private secretary to the Imberts, husband and wife, at a\r\nsalary of one hundred francs a month. He was to come to the house every\r\nday and receive orders for his work, and a room on the second floor\r\nwas set apart as his office. This room was directly over Mon. Imbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne soon realized that his position as secretary was essentially\r\na sinecure. During the first two months, he had only four important\r\nletters to recopy, and was called only once to Mon. Imbert\xe2\x80\x99s office;\r\nconsequently, he had only one opportunity to contemplate, officially,\r\nthe Imbert safe. Moreover, he noticed that the secretary was not invited\r\nto the social functions of the employer. But he did not complain, as he\r\npreferred to remain, modestly, in the shade and maintain his peace and\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was not wasting any time. From the beginning, he made\r\nclandestine visits to Mon. Imbert\xe2\x80\x99s office, and paid his respects to the\r\nsafe, which was hermetically closed. It was an immense block of iron and\r\nsteel, cold and stern in appearance, which could not be forced open\r\nby the ordinary tools of the burglar\xe2\x80\x99s trade. But Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was not\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere force fails, cunning prevails,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nessential thing is to be on the spot when the opportunity occurs. In the\r\nmeantime, I must watch and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made immediately some preliminary preparations. After careful\r\nsoundings made upon the floor of his room, he introduced a lead pipe\r\nwhich penetrated the ceiling of Mon. Imbert\xe2\x80\x99s office at a point between\r\nthe two screeds of the cornice. By means of this pipe, he hoped to see\r\nand hear what transpired in the room below.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, he passed his days stretched at full length upon the floor.\r\nHe frequently saw the Imberts holding a consultation in front of the\r\nsafe, investigating books and papers. When they turned the combination\r\nlock, he tried to learn the figures and the number of turns they made to\r\nthe right and left. He watched their movements; he sought to catch their\r\nwords. There was also a key necessary to complete the opening of the\r\nsafe. What did they do with it? Did they hide it?\r\n\r\nOne day, he saw them leave the room without locking the safe. He\r\ndescended the stairs quickly, and boldly entered the room. But they had\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI made a mistake in the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Monsieur Lupin, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Imbert, \xe2\x80\x9care you not at\r\nhome here? We want your advice. What bonds should we sell? The foreign\r\nsecurities or the government annuities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the injunction?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lupin, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover all the bonds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of the safe and withdrew a package of bonds. But her\r\nhusband protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Gervaise, it would be foolish to sell the foreign bonds. They\r\nare going up, whilst the annuities are as high as they ever will be.\r\nWhat do you think, my dear friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dear friend had no opinion; yet he advised the sacrifice of the\r\nannuities. Then she withdrew another package and, from it, she took\r\na paper at random. It proved to be a three-per-cent annuity worth two\r\nthousand francs. Ludovic placed the package of bonds in his pocket.\r\nThat afternoon, accompanied by his secretary, he sold the annuities to a\r\nstock-broker and realized forty-six thousand francs.\r\n\r\nWhatever Madame Imbert might have said about it, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin did not\r\nfeel at home in the Imbert house. On the contrary, his position there\r\nwas a peculiar one. He learned that the servants did not even know his\r\nname. They called him \xe2\x80\x9cmonsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d Ludovic always spoke of him in the\r\nsame way: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will tell monsieur. Has monsieur arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d Why that\r\nmysterious appellation?\r\n\r\nMoreover, after their first outburst of enthusiasm, the Imberts seldom\r\nspoke to him, and, although treating him with the consideration due to\r\na benefactor, they gave him little or no attention. They appeared to\r\nregard him as an eccentric character who did not like to be disturbed,\r\nand they respected his isolation as if it were a stringent rule on his\r\npart. On one occasion, while passing through the vestibule, he heard\r\nMadame Imbert say to the two gentlemen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is such a barbarian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a barbarian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, without seeking to solve the question of their strange conduct, he\r\nproceeded with the execution of his own plans. He had decided that he\r\ncould not depend on chance, nor on the negligence of Madame Imbert, who\r\ncarried the key of the safe, and who, on locking the safe, invariably\r\nscattered the letters forming the combination of the lock. Consequently,\r\nhe must act for himself.\r\n\r\nFinally, an incident precipitated matters; it was the vehement campaign\r\ninstituted against the Imberts by certain newspapers that accused\r\nthe Imberts of swindling. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was present at certain family\r\nconferences when this new vicissitude was discussed. He decided that if\r\nhe waited much longer, he would lose everything. During the next five\r\ndays, instead of leaving the house about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, according to his\r\nusual habit, he locked himself in his room. It was supposed that he had\r\ngone out. But he was lying on the floor surveying the office of Mon.\r\nImbert. During those five evenings, the favorable opportunity that he\r\nawaited did not take place. He left the house about midnight by a side\r\ndoor to which he held the key.\r\n\r\nBut on the sixth day, he learned that the Imberts, actuated by the\r\nmalevolent insinuations of their enemies, proposed to make an inventory\r\nof the contents of the safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will do it to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Lupin.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, after dinner, Imbert and his wife retired to the office and\r\ncommenced to examine the books of account and the securities contained\r\nin the safe. Thus, one hour after another passed away. He heard the\r\nservants go upstairs to their rooms. No one now remained on the first\r\nfloor. Midnight! The Imberts were still at work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must get to work,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Lupin.\r\n\r\nHe opened his window. It opened on a court. Outside, everything was\r\ndark and quiet. He took from his desk a knotted rope, fastened it to\r\nthe balcony in front of his window, and quietly descended as far as the\r\nwindow below, which was that of the of Imbert\xe2\x80\x99s office. He stood upon\r\nthe balcony for a moment, motionless, with attentive ear and watchful\r\neye, but the heavy curtains effectually concealed the interior of the\r\nroom. He cautiously pushed on the double window. If no one had examined\r\nit, it ought to yield to the slightest pressure, for, during the\r\nafternoon, he had so fixed the bolt that it would not enter the staple.\r\n\r\nThe window yielded to his touch. Then, with infinite care, he pushed\r\nit open sufficiently to admit his head. He parted the curtains a few\r\ninches, looked in, and saw Mon. Imbert and his wife sitting in front\r\nof the safe, deeply absorbed in their work and speaking softly to each\r\nother at rare intervals.\r\n\r\nHe calculated the distance between him and them, considered the exact\r\nmovements he would require to make in order to overcome them, one after\r\nthe other, before they could call for help, and he was about to rush\r\nupon them, when Madame Imbert said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you, my\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall stay and finish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinish! Why, that will take you all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. An hour, at the most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe retired. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes passed. Ars\xc3\xa8ne pushed the\r\nwindow a little farther open. The curtains shook. He pushed once more.\r\nMon. Imbert turned, and, seeing the curtains blown by the wind, he rose\r\nto close the window.\r\n\r\nThere was not a cry, not the trace of struggle. With a few precise\r\nmoments, and without causing him the least injury, Ars\xc3\xa8ne stunned him,\r\nwrapped the curtain about his head, bound him hand and foot, and did it\r\nall in such a manner that Mon. Imbert had no opportunity to recognize\r\nhis assailant.\r\n\r\nQuickly, he approached the safe, seized two packages that he placed\r\nunder his arm, left the office, and opened the servants\xe2\x80\x99 gate. A\r\ncarriage was stationed in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that, first--and follow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the coachman. He returned\r\nto the office, and, in two trips, they emptied the safe. Then Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nwent to his own room, removed the rope, and all other traces of his\r\nclandestine work.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and his assistant examined the stolen\r\ngoods. Lupin was not disappointed, as he had foreseen that the wealth of\r\nthe Imberts had been greatly exaggerated. It did not consist of hundreds\r\nof millions, nor even tens of millions. Yet it amounted to a very\r\nrespectable sum, and Lupin expressed his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be a considerable loss when we come\r\nto sell the bonds, as we will have to dispose of them surreptitiously\r\nat reduced prices. In the meantime, they will rest quietly in my desk\r\nawaiting a propitious moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne saw no reason why he should not go to the Imbert house the next\r\nday. But a perusal of the morning papers revealed this startling fact:\r\nLudovic and Gervaise Imbert had disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the officers of the law seized the safe and opened it, they found\r\nthere what Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had left--nothing.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts; and I learned the sequel to them, one day, when\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was in a confidential mood. He was pacing to and fro in my\r\nroom, with a nervous step and a feverish eye that were unusual to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cit was your most successful venture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout making a direct reply, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some impenetrable secrets connected with that affair; some\r\nobscure points that escape my comprehension. For instance: What\r\ncaused their flight? Why did they not take advantage of the help I\r\nunconsciously gave them? It would have been so simple to say: \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nhundred millions were in the safe. They are no longer there, because\r\nthey have been stolen.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey lost their nerve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is it--they lost their nerve...On the other hand, it is\r\ntrue---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s reticence? It was quite obvious that he\r\nhad not told me everything; there was something he was loath to tell.\r\nHis conduct puzzled me. It must indeed be a very serious matter to cause\r\nsuch a man as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin even a momentary hesitation. I threw out a\r\nfew questions at random.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen them since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you never experienced the slightest degree of pity for those\r\nunfortunate people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a start.\r\n\r\nHis sudden excitement astonished me. Had I touched him on a sore spot? I\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. If you had not left them alone, they might have been able to\r\nface the danger, or, at least, made their escape with full pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have an idea\r\nthat my soul should be filled with remorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall it remorse or regrets--anything you like---\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no regrets or remorse for having stolen their fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe packages of bonds you took from their safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I stole their bonds, did I? I deprived them of a portion of their\r\nwealth? Is that my crime? Ah! my dear boy, you do not know the truth.\r\nYou never imagined that those bonds were not worth the paper they were\r\nwritten on. Those bonds were false--they were counterfeit--every one of\r\nthem--do you understand? THEY WERE COUNTERFEIT!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him, astounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCounterfeit! The four or five millions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, counterfeit!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in a fit of rage. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly so many scraps\r\nof paper! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise a sou on the whole of them! And you ask me if\r\nI have any remorse. _They_ are the ones who should have remorse and pity.\r\nThey played me for a simpleton; and I fell into their trap. I was their\r\nlatest victim, their most stupid gull!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was affected by genuine anger--the result of malice and wounded\r\npride. He continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom start to finish, I got the worst of it. Do you know the part I\r\nplayed in that affair, or rather the part they made me play? That of\r\nAndr\xc3\xa9 Brawford! Yes, my boy, that is the truth, and I never suspected\r\nit. It was not until afterwards, on reading the newspapers, that the\r\nlight finally dawned in my stupid brain. Whilst I was posing as his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csaviour,\xe2\x80\x9d as the gentleman who had risked his life to rescue Mon.\r\nImbert from the clutches of an assassin, they were passing me off as\r\nBrawford. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that splendid? That eccentric individual who had a\r\nroom on the second floor, that barbarian that was exhibited only at a\r\ndistance, was Brawford, and Brawford was I! Thanks to me, and to the\r\nconfidence that I inspired under the name of Brawford, they were enabled\r\nto borrow money from the bankers and other money-lenders. Ha! what an\r\nexperience for a novice! And I swear to you that I shall profit by the\r\nlesson!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, seized my arm, and said to me, in a tone of exasperation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, at this very moment, Gervaise Imbert owes me fifteen\r\nhundred francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not refrain from laughter, his rage was so grotesque. He was\r\nmaking a mountain out of a molehill. In a moment, he laughed himself,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy, fifteen hundred francs. You must know that I had not\r\nreceived one sou of my promised salary, and, more than that, she had\r\nborrowed from me the sum of fifteen hundred francs. All my youthful\r\nsavings! And do you know why? To devote the money to charity! I am\r\ngiving you a straight story. She wanted it for some poor people she was\r\nassisting--unknown to her husband. And my hard-earned money was wormed\r\nout of me by that silly pretense! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it amusing, hein? Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\ndone out of fifteen hundred francs by the fair lady from whom he stole\r\nfour millions in counterfeit bonds! And what a vast amount of time and\r\npatience and cunning I expended to achieve that result! It was the first\r\ntime in my life that I was played for a fool, and I frankly confess that\r\nI was fooled that time to the queen\xe2\x80\x99s taste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. The Black Pearl\r\n\r\n\r\nA violent ringing of the bell awakened the concierge of number nine,\r\navenue Hoche. She pulled the doorstring, grumbling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought everybody was in. It must be three o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is some one for the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered her husband.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, a voice inquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Harel .... what floor?\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThird floor, left. But the doctor won\xe2\x80\x99t go out at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must go to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor entered the vestibule, ascended to the first floor, the\r\nsecond, the third, and, without stopping at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s door, he\r\ncontinued to the fifth floor. There, he tried two keys. One of them\r\nfitted the lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! good!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cthat simplifies the business wonderfully.\r\nBut before I commence work I had better arrange for my retreat. Let me\r\nsee.... have I had sufficient time to rouse the doctor and be dismissed\r\nby him? Not yet.... a few minutes more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten minutes, he descended the stairs, grumbling noisily\r\nabout the doctor. The concierge opened the door for him and heard it\r\nclick behind him. But the door did not lock, as the man had quickly\r\ninserted a piece of iron in the lock in such a manner that the bolt\r\ncould not enter. Then, quietly, he entered the house again, unknown to\r\nthe concierge. In case of alarm, his retreat was assured. Noiselessly,\r\nhe ascended to the fifth floor once more. In the antechamber, by the\r\nlight of his electric lantern, he placed his hat and overcoat on one\r\nof the chairs, took a seat on another, and covered his heavy shoes with\r\nfelt slippers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOuf! Here I am--and how simple it was! I wonder why more people do not\r\nadopt the profitable and pleasant occupation of burglar. With a little\r\ncare and reflection, it becomes a most delightful profession. Not too\r\nquiet and monotonous, of course, as it would then become wearisome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unfolded a detailed plan of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me commence by locating myself. Here, I see the vestibule in which\r\nI am sitting. On the street front, the drawing-room, the boudoir and\r\ndining-room. Useless to waste any time there, as it appears that the\r\ncountess has a deplorable taste.... not a bibelot of any value!...Now,\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s get down to business!... Ah! here is a corridor; it must lead to\r\nthe bed chambers. At a distance of three metres, I should come to the\r\ndoor of the wardrobe-closet which connects with the chamber of the\r\ncountess.\xe2\x80\x9d He folded his plan, extinguished his lantern, and proceeded\r\ndown the corridor, counting his distance, thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne metre.... two metres.... three metres....Here is the door....Mon\r\nDieu, how easy it is! Only a small, simple bolt now separates me from\r\nthe chamber, and I know that the bolt is located exactly one metre,\r\nforty-three centimeters, from the floor. So that, thanks to a small\r\nincision I am about to make, I can soon get rid of the bolt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew from his pocket the necessary instruments. Then the following\r\nidea occurred to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, by chance, the door is not bolted. I will try it first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned the knob, and the door opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brave Lupin, surely fortune favors you....What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done now?\r\nYou know the situation of the rooms; you know the place in which the\r\ncountess hides the black pearl. Therefore, in order to secure the black\r\npearl, you have simply to be more silent than silence, more invisible\r\nthan darkness itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin was employed fully a half-hour in opening the second\r\ndoor--a glass door that led to the countess\xe2\x80\x99 bedchamber. But he\r\naccomplished it with so much skill and precaution, that even had\r\nthe countess been awake, she would not have heard the slightest sound.\r\nAccording to the plan of the rooms, that he holds, he has merely to pass\r\naround a reclining chair and, beyond that, a small table close to the\r\nbed. On the table, there was a box of letter-paper, and the black pearl\r\nwas concealed in that box. He stooped and crept cautiously over the\r\ncarpet, following the outlines of the reclining-chair. When he reached\r\nthe extremity of it, he stopped in order to repress the throbbing of\r\nhis heart. Although he was not moved by any sense of fear, he found it\r\nimpossible to overcome the nervous anxiety that one usually feels in the\r\nmidst of profound silence. That circumstance astonished him, because he\r\nhad passed through many more solemn moments without the slightest trace\r\nof emotion. No danger threatened him. Then why did his heart throb like\r\nan alarm-bell? Was it that sleeping woman who affected him? Was it the\r\nproximity of another pulsating heart?\r\n\r\nHe listened, and thought he could discern the rhythmical breathing of a\r\nperson asleep. It gave him confidence, like the presence of a friend.\r\nHe sought and found the armchair; then, by slow, cautious movements,\r\nadvanced toward the table, feeling ahead of him with outstretched arm.\r\nHis right had touched one of the feet of the table. Ah! now, he had\r\nsimply to rise, take the pearl, and escape. That was fortunate, as his\r\nheart was leaping in his breast like a wild beast, and made so much\r\nnoise that he feared it would waken the countess. By a powerful effort\r\nof the will, he subdued the wild throbbing of his heart, and was about\r\nto rise from the floor when his left hand encountered, lying on the\r\nfloor, an object which he recognized as a candlestick--an overturned\r\ncandlestick. A moment later, his hand encountered another object:\r\na clock--one of those small traveling clocks, covered with\r\nleather.-------\r\n\r\nWell! What had happened? He could not understand. That candlestick, that\r\nclock; why were those articles not in their accustomed places? Ah! what\r\nhad happened in the dread silence of the night?\r\n\r\nSuddenly a cry escaped him. He had touched--oh! some strange,\r\nunutterable thing! \xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be. It is some\r\nfantasy of my excited brain.\xe2\x80\x9d For twenty seconds, thirty seconds, he\r\nremained motionless, terrified, his forehead bathed with perspiration,\r\nand his fingers still retained the sensation of that dreadful contact.\r\n\r\nMaking a desperate effort, he ventured to extend his arm again. Once\r\nmore, his hand encountered that strange, unutterable thing. He felt\r\nit. He must feel it and find out what it is. He found that it was hair,\r\nhuman hair, and a human face; and that face was cold, almost icy.\r\n\r\nHowever frightful the circumstances may be, a man like Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\ncontrols himself and commands the situation as soon as he learns what it\r\nis. So, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin quickly brought his lantern into use. A woman\r\nwas lying before him, covered with blood. Her neck and shoulders\r\nwere covered with gaping wounds. He leaned over her and made a closer\r\nexamination. She was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead! Dead!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with a bewildered air.\r\n\r\nHe stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh,\r\nand that blood--all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and\r\ncongealed there in thick, black spots. He arose and turned on the\r\nelectric lights. Then he beheld all the marks of a desperate struggle.\r\nThe bed was in a state of great disorder. On the floor, the candlestick,\r\nand the clock, with the hands pointing to twenty minutes after eleven;\r\nthen, further away, an overturned chair; and, everywhere, there was\r\nblood, spots of blood and pools of blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the black pearl?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe box of letter-paper was in its place. He opened it, eagerly. The\r\njewel-case was there, but it was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFichtre!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou boasted of your good fortune much too soon,\r\nmy friend Lupin. With the countess lying cold and dead, and the black\r\npearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant. Get out of here\r\nas soon as you can, or you may get into serious trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet, he did not move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out of here? Yes, of course. Any person would, except Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\nHe has something better to do. Now, to proceed in an orderly way. At\r\nall events, you have a clear conscience. Let us suppose that you are\r\nthe commissary of police and that you are proceeding to make an inquiry\r\nconcerning this affair----Yes, but in order to do that, I require a\r\nclearer brain. Mine is muddled like a ragout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tumbled into an armchair, with his clenched hands pressed against his\r\nburning forehead.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe murder of the avenue Hoche is one of those which have recently\r\nsurprised and puzzled the Parisian public, and, certainly, I should\r\nnever have mentioned the affair if the veil of mystery had not been\r\nremoved by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin himself. No one knew the exact truth of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nWho did not know--from having met her in the Bois--the fair L\xc3\xa9otine\r\nZalti, the once-famous cantatrice, wife and widow of the Count\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Andillot; the Zalti, whose luxury dazzled all Paris some twenty years\r\nago; the Zalti who acquired an European reputation for the magnificence\r\nof her diamonds and pearls? It was said that she wore upon her shoulders\r\nthe capital of several banking houses and the gold mines of numerous\r\nAustralian companies. Skilful jewelers worked for Zalti as they had\r\nformerly wrought for kings and queens. And who does not remember the\r\ncatastrophe in which all that wealth was swallowed up? Of all that\r\nmarvelous collection, nothing remained except the famous black pearl.\r\nThe black pearl! That is to say a fortune, if she had wished to part\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nBut she preferred to keep it, to live in a commonplace apartment with\r\nher companion, her cook, and a man-servant, rather than sell that\r\ninestimable jewel. There was a reason for it; a reason she was not\r\nafraid to disclose: the black pearl was the gift of an emperor! Almost\r\nruined, and reduced to the most mediocre existence, she remained\r\nfaithful to the companion of her happy and brilliant youth. The black\r\npearl never left her possession. She wore it during the day, and, at\r\nnight, concealed it in a place known to her alone.\r\n\r\nAll these facts, being republished in the columns of the public press,\r\nserved to stimulate curiosity; and, strange to say, but quite obvious\r\nto those who have the key to the mystery, the arrest of the presumed\r\nassassin only complicated the question and prolonged the excitement. Two\r\ndays later, the newspapers published the following item:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInformation has reached us of the arrest of Victor Dan\xc3\xa8gre, the servant\r\nof the Countess d\xe2\x80\x99Andillot. The evidence against him is clear and\r\nconvincing. On the silken sleeve of his liveried waistcoat, which chief\r\ndetective Dudouis found in his garret between the mattresses of his bed,\r\nseveral spots of blood were discovered. In addition, a cloth-covered\r\nbutton was missing from that garment, and this button was found beneath\r\nthe bed of the victim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is supposed that, after dinner, in place of going to his own room,\r\nDan\xc3\xa8gre slipped into the wardrobe-closet, and, through the glass door,\r\nhad seen the countess hide the precious black pearl. This is simply\r\na theory, as yet unverified by any evidence. There is, also, another\r\nobscure point. At seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, Dan\xc3\xa8gre went to the\r\ntobacco-shop on the Boulevard de Courcelles; the concierge and the\r\nshop-keeper both affirm this fact. On the other hand, the countess\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncompanion and cook, who sleep at the end of the hall, both declare that,\r\nwhen they arose at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the door of the antechamber and the\r\ndoor of the kitchen were locked. These two persons have been in the\r\nservice of the countess for twenty years, and are above suspicion. The\r\nquestion is: How did Dan\xc3\xa8gre leave the apartment? Did he have another\r\nkey? These are matters that the police will investigate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the police investigation threw no light on the\r\nmystery. It was learned that Victor Dan\xc3\xa8gre was a dangerous criminal, a\r\ndrunkard and a debauchee. But, as they proceeded with the investigation,\r\nthe mystery deepened and new complications arose. In the first place,\r\na young woman, Mlle. De Sincl\xc3\xa8ves, the cousin and sole heiress of the\r\ncountess, declared that the countess, a month before her death, had\r\nwritten a letter to her and in it described the manner in which the\r\nblack pearl was concealed. The letter disappeared the day after she\r\nreceived it. Who had stolen it?\r\n\r\nAgain, the concierge related how she had opened the door for a person\r\nwho had inquired for Doctor Harel. On being questioned, the doctor\r\ntestified that no one had rung his bell. Then who was that person? An\r\naccomplice?\r\n\r\nThe theory of an accomplice was thereupon adopted by the press and\r\npublic, and also by Ganimard, the famous detective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin is at the bottom of this affair,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the judge, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have Lupin on the brain. You see him\r\neverywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see him everywhere, because he is everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay rather that you see him every time you encounter something you\r\ncannot explain. Besides, you overlook the fact that the crime was\r\ncommitted at twenty minutes past eleven in the evening, as is shown\r\nby the clock, while the nocturnal visit, mentioned by the concierge,\r\noccurred at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOfficers of the law frequently form a hasty conviction as to the guilt\r\nof a suspected person, and then distort all subsequent discoveries\r\nto conform to their established theory. The deplorable antecedents of\r\nVictor Dan\xc3\xa8gre, habitual criminal, drunkard and rake, influenced\r\nthe judge, and despite the fact that nothing new was discovered in\r\ncorroboration of the early clues, his official opinion remained firm and\r\nunshaken. He closed his investigation, and, a few weeks later, the trial\r\ncommenced. It proved to be slow and tedious. The judge was listless,\r\nand the public prosecutor presented the case in a careless manner. Under\r\nthose circumstances, Dan\xc3\xa8gre\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had an easy task. He pointed out\r\nthe defects and inconsistencies of the case for the prosecution, and\r\nargued that the evidence was quite insufficient to convict the accused.\r\nWho had made the key, the indispensable key without which Dan\xc3\xa8gre, on\r\nleaving the apartment, could not have locked the door behind him? Who\r\nhad ever seen such a key, and what had become of it? Who had seen the\r\nassassin\xe2\x80\x99s knife, and where is it now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn any event,\xe2\x80\x9d argued the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, \xe2\x80\x9cthe prosecution must\r\nprove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the prisoner committed the\r\nmurder. The prosecution must show that the mysterious individual who\r\nentered the house at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning is not the guilty\r\nparty. To be sure, the clock indicated eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. But what of that?\r\nI contend, that proves nothing. The assassin could turn the hands of the\r\nclock to any hour he pleased, and thus deceive us in regard to the exact\r\nhour of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor Dan\xc3\xa8gre was acquitted.\r\n\r\nHe left the prison on Friday about dusk in the evening, weak and\r\ndepressed by his six months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment. The inquisition, the\r\nsolitude, the trial, the deliberations of the jury, combined to fill\r\nhim with a nervous fear. At night, he had been afflicted with terrible\r\nnightmares and haunted by weird visions of the scaffold. He was a mental\r\nand physical wreck.\r\n\r\nUnder the assumed name of Anatole Dufour, he rented a small room on the\r\nheights of Montmartre, and lived by doing odd jobs wherever he could\r\nfind them. He led a pitiful existence. Three times, he obtained regular\r\nemployment, only to be recognized and then discharged. Sometimes, he\r\nhad an idea that men were following him--detectives, no doubt, who were\r\nseeking to trap and denounce him. He could almost feel the strong hand\r\nof the law clutching him by the collar.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as he was eating his dinner at a neighboring restaurant,\r\na man entered and took a seat at the same table. He was a person about\r\nforty years of age, and wore a frock-coat of doubtful cleanliness. He\r\nordered soup, vegetables, and a bottle of wine. After he had finished\r\nhis soup, he turned his eyes on Dan\xc3\xa8gre, and gazed at him intently.\r\nDan\xc3\xa8gre winced. He was certain that this was one of the men who had\r\nbeen following him for several weeks. What did he want? Dan\xc3\xa8gre tried\r\nto rise, but failed. His limbs refused to support him. The man poured\r\nhimself a glass of wine, and then filled Dan\xc3\xa8gre\xe2\x80\x99s glass. The man raised\r\nhis glass, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your health, Victor Dan\xc3\xa8gre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor started in alarm, and stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!....I!.... no, no....I swear to you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will swear what? That you are not yourself? The servant of the\r\ncountess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat servant? My name is Dufour. Ask the proprietor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Anatole Dufour to the proprietor of this restaurant, but Victor\r\nDan\xc3\xa8gre to the officers of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not true! Some one has lied to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe new-comer took a card from his pocket and handed it to Victor, who\r\nread on it: \xe2\x80\x9cGrimaudan, ex-inspector of the detective force. Private\r\nbusiness transacted.\xe2\x80\x9d Victor shuddered as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are connected with the police?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not now, but I have a liking for the business and I continue to\r\nwork at it in a manner more--profitable. From time to time I strike upon\r\na golden opportunity--such as your case presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yours. I assure you it is a most promising affair, provided you\r\nare inclined to be reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I am not reasonable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my good fellow, you are not in a position to refuse me anything I\r\nmay ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it.... you want?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Victor, fearfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will inform you in a few words. I am sent by Mademoiselle de\r\nSincl\xc3\xa8ves, the heiress of the Countess d\xe2\x80\x99Andillot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo recover the black pearl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack pearl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you stole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had, then I would be the assassin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the assassin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan\xc3\xa8gre showed a forced smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately for me, monsieur, the Assizecourt was not of your opinion.\r\nThe jury returned an unanimous verdict of acquittal. And when a man has\r\na clear conscience and twelve good men in his favor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ex-inspector seized him by the arm and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fine phrases, my boy. Now, listen to me and weigh my words\r\ncarefully. You will find they are worthy of your consideration. Now,\r\nDan\xc3\xa8gre, three weeks before the murder, you abstracted the cook\xe2\x80\x99s key\r\nto the servants\xe2\x80\x99 door, and had a duplicate key made by a locksmith named\r\nOutard, 244 rue Oberkampf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie--it\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Victor. \xe2\x80\x9cNo person has seen that key.\r\nThere is no such key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a silence, Grimaudan continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou killed the countess with a knife purchased by you at the Bazar de\r\nla Republique on the same day as you ordered the duplicate key. It has a\r\ntriangular blade with a groove running from end to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all nonsense. You are simply guessing at something you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. No one ever saw the knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor Dan\xc3\xa8gre recoiled. The ex-inspector continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some spots of rust upon it. Shall I tell you how they came\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!.... you have a key and a knife. Who can prove that they belong to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe locksmith, and the clerk from whom you bought the knife. I have\r\nalready refreshed their memories, and, when you confront them, they\r\ncannot fail to recognize you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis speech was dry and hard, with a tone of firmness and precision.\r\nDan\xc3\xa8gre was trembling with fear, and yet he struggled desperately to\r\nmaintain an air of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all the evidence you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, not at all. I have plenty more. For instance, after the crime,\r\nyou went out the same way you had entered. But, in the centre of the\r\nwardrobe-room, being seized by some sudden fear, you leaned against the\r\nwall for support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that? No one could know such a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d argued the\r\ndesperate man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe police know nothing about it, of course. They never think of\r\nlighting a candle and examining the walls. But if they had done so, they\r\nwould have found on the white plaster a faint red spot, quite distinct,\r\nhowever, to trace in it the imprint of your thumb which you had pressed\r\nagainst the wall while it was wet with blood. Now, as you are well\r\naware, under the Bertillon system, thumb-marks are one of the principal\r\nmeans of identification.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor Dan\xc3\xa8gre was livid; great drops of perspiration rolled down his\r\nface and fell upon the table. He gazed, with a wild look, at the strange\r\nman who had narrated the story of his crime as faithfully as if he had\r\nbeen an invisible witness to it. Overcome and powerless, Victor bowed\r\nhis head. He felt that it was useless to struggle against this marvelous\r\nman. So he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much will you give me, if I give you the pearl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you are joking! Or do you mean that I should give you an article\r\nworth thousands and hundreds of thousands and get nothing in return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will get your life. Is that nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate man shuddered. Then Grimaudan added, in a milder tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Dan\xc3\xa8gre, that pearl has no value in your hands. It is quite\r\nimpossible for you to sell it; so what is the use of your keeping it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are pawnbrokers.... and, some day, I will be able to get something\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that day may be too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause by that time you may be in the hands of the police, and,\r\nwith the evidence that I can furnish--the knife, the key, the\r\nthumb-mark--what will become of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor rested his head on his hands and reflected. He felt that he was\r\nlost, irremediably lost, and, at the same time, a sense of weariness and\r\ndepression overcame him. He murmured, faintly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen must I give it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night---within an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you refuse, I shall post this letter to the Procureur of the\r\nRepublic; in which letter Mademoiselle de Sincl\xc3\xa8ves denounces you as the\r\nassassin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan\xc3\xa8gre poured out two glasses of wine which he drank in rapid\r\nsuccession, then, rising, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay the bill, and let us go. I have had enough of the cursed affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNight had fallen. The two men walked down the rue Lepic and followed\r\nthe exterior boulevards in the direction of the Place de l\xe2\x80\x99Etoile.\r\nThey pursued their way in silence; Victor had a stooping carriage and a\r\ndejected face. When they reached the Parc Monceau, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are near the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParbleu! You only left the house once, before your arrest, and that was\r\nto go to the tobacco-shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan\xc3\xa8gre, in a dull voice.\r\n\r\nThey passed along the garden wall of the countess\xe2\x80\x99 house, and crossed a\r\nstreet on a corner of which stood the tobacco-shop. A few steps further\r\non, Dan\xc3\xa8gre stopped; his limbs shook beneath him, and he sank to a\r\nbench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! what now?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Come, now, no nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--in front of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween two paving-stones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich stones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictor made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh; I see!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Grimaudan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want me to pay for the\r\ninformation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.... but....I am afraid I will starve to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! that is why you hesitate. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be hard on you. How much\r\ndo you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough to buy a steerage pass to America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a hundred francs to keep me until I get work there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have two hundred. Now, speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount the paving-stones to the right from the sewer-hole. The pearl is\r\nbetween the twelfth and thirteenth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the gutter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, close to the sidewalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaudan glanced around to see if anyone were looking. Some tram-cars\r\nand pedestrians were passing. But, bah, they will not suspect anything.\r\nHe opened his pocketknife and thrust it between the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth stones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it is not there?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Victor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be there, unless someone saw me stoop down and hide it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCould it be possible that the back pearl had been cast into the mud\r\nand filth of the gutter to be picked up by the first comer? The black\r\npearl--a fortune!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far down?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout ten centimetres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dug up the wet earth. The point of his knife struck something. He\r\nenlarged the hole with his finger. Then he abstracted the black pearl\r\nfrom its filthy hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! Here are your two hundred francs. I will send you the ticket for\r\nAmerica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the following day, this article was published in the \xe2\x80\x98Echo de\r\nFrance,\xe2\x80\x99 and was copied by the leading newspapers throughout the world:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday, the famous black pearl came into the possession of\r\n  Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, who recovered it from the murderer of the Countess\r\n  d\xe2\x80\x99Andillot.  In a short time, fac-similes of that precious jewel\r\n  will be exhibited in London, St. Petersburg, Calcutta, Buenos Ayres\r\n  and New York.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin will be pleased to consider all propositions\r\n  submitted to him through his agents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, after he had told me the foregoing history of the black\r\npearl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is how you, under the assumed name of Grimaudan, ex-inspector\r\nof detectives, were chosen by fate to deprive the criminal of the\r\nbenefit of his crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. And I confess that the affair gives me infinite satisfaction\r\nand pride. The forty minutes that I passed in the apartment of the\r\nCountess d\xe2\x80\x99Andillot, after learning of her death, were the most\r\nthrilling and absorbing moments of my life. In those forty minutes,\r\ninvolved as I was in a most dangerous plight, I calmly studied the scene\r\nof the murder and reached the conclusion that the crime must have been\r\ncommitted by one of the house servants. I also decided that, in order\r\nto get the pearl, that servant must be arrested, and so I left the\r\nwainscoat button; it was necessary, also, for me to hold some convincing\r\nevidence of his guilt, so I carried away the knife which I found upon\r\nthe floor, and the key which I found in the lock. I closed and\r\nlocked the door, and erased the finger-marks from the plaster in the\r\nwardrobe-closet. In my opinion, that was one of those flashes--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf genius,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, interrupting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf genius, if you wish. But, I flatter myself, it would not have\r\noccurred to the average mortal. To frame, instantly, the two elements of\r\nthe problem--an arrest and an acquittal; to make use of the formidable\r\nmachinery of the law to crush and humble my victim, and reduce him to a\r\ncondition in which, when free, he would be certain to fall into the trap\r\nI was laying for him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil, do you say? Victor Dan\xc3\xa8gre, the assassin! He might have\r\ndescended to the lowest depths of vice and crime, if he had retained the\r\nblack pearl. Now, he lives! Think of that: Victor Dan\xc3\xa8gre is alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have the black pearl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it out of one of the secret pockets of his wallet, examined it,\r\ngazed at it tenderly, and caressed it with loving fingers, and sighed,\r\nas he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cold Russian prince, what vain and foolish rajah may some day\r\npossess this priceless treasure! Or, perhaps, some American millionaire\r\nis destined to become the owner of this morsel of exquisite beauty that\r\nonce adorned the fair bosom of Leontine Zalti, the Countess d\xe2\x80\x99Andillot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is really remarkable, Velmont, what a close resemblance you bear to\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! like everyone else, from photographs, no two of which are alike,\r\nbut each of them leaves the impression of a face.... something like\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace Velmont displayed some vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, my dear Devanne. And, believe me, you are not the first one\r\nwho has noticed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so striking,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Devanne, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you had not been\r\nrecommended to me by my cousin d\xe2\x80\x99Estevan, and if you were not the\r\ncelebrated artist whose beautiful marine views I so admire, I have no\r\ndoubt I should have warned the police of your presence in Dieppe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sally was greeted with an outburst of laughter. The large\r\ndining-hall of the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Thibermesnil contained on this occasion,\r\nbesides Velmont, the following guests: Father G\xc3\xa9lis, the parish priest,\r\nand a dozen officers whose regiments were quartered in the vicinity and\r\nwho had accepted the invitation of the banker Georges Devanne and his\r\nmother. One of the officers then remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that an exact description of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin has been\r\nfurnished to all the police along this coast since his daring exploit on\r\nthe Paris-Havre express.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Devanne. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was three months ago; and a week\r\nlater, I made the acquaintance of our friend Velmont at the casino, and,\r\nsince then, he has honored me with several visits--an agreeable preamble\r\nto a more serious visit that he will pay me one of these days--or,\r\nrather, one of these nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech evoked another round of laughter, and the guests then passed\r\ninto the ancient \xe2\x80\x9cHall of the Guards,\xe2\x80\x9d a vast room with a high ceiling,\r\nwhich occupied the entire lower part of the Tour Guillaume--William\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nTower--and wherein Georges Devanne had collected the incomparable\r\ntreasures which the lords of Thibermesnil had accumulated through\r\nmany centuries. It contained ancient chests, credences, andirons and\r\nchandeliers. The stone walls were overhung with magnificent tapestries.\r\nThe deep embrasures of the four windows were furnished with benches, and\r\nthe Gothic windows were composed of small panes of colored glass set\r\nin a leaden frame. Between the door and the window to the left stood\r\nan immense bookcase of Renaissance style, on the pediment of which, in\r\nletters of gold, was the word \xe2\x80\x9cThibermesnil,\xe2\x80\x9d and, below it, the proud\r\nfamily device: \xe2\x80\x9cFais ce que veulx\xe2\x80\x9d (Do what thou wishest). When the\r\nguests had lighted their cigars, Devanne resumed the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd remember, Velmont, you have no time to lose; in fact, to-night is\r\nthe last chance you will have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the painter, who appeared to regard the affair as a\r\njoke. Devanne was about to reply, when his mother mentioned to him to\r\nkeep silent, but the excitement of the occasion and a desire to interest\r\nhis guests urged him to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell it now. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests drew closer, and he commenced to speak with the satisfied air\r\nof a man who has an important announcement to make.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow afternoon at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Sherlock Holmes, the famous\r\nEnglish detective, for whom such a thing as mystery does not exist;\r\nSherlock Holmes, the most remarkable solver of enigmas the world has\r\never known, that marvelous man who would seem to be the creation of a\r\nromantic novelist--Sherlock Holmes will be my guest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately, Devanne was the target of numerous eager questions. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nSherlock Holmes really coming?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs it so serious as that?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin really in this neighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and his band are not far away. Besides the robbery of the\r\nBaron Cahorn, he is credited with the thefts at Montigny, Gruchet and\r\nCrasville. And now it is my turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he sent you a warning, as he did to Baron Cahorn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Devanne, \xe2\x80\x9che can\xe2\x80\x99t work the same trick twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, and pointing to a small empty space between the two enormous\r\nfolios on one of the shelves of the bookcase, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere used to be a book there--a book of the sixteenth century entitled\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chronique de Thibermesnil,\xe2\x80\x99 which contained the history of the castle\r\nsince its construction by Duke Rollo on the site of a former feudal\r\nfortress. There were three engraved plates in the book; one of which was\r\na general view of the whole estate; another, the plan of the buildings;\r\nand the third--I call your attention to it, particularly--the third was\r\nthe sketch of a subterranean passage, an entrance to which is outside\r\nthe first line of ramparts, while the other end of the passage is here,\r\nin this very room. Well, that book disappeared a month ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d said Velmont, \xe2\x80\x9cthat looks bad. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be a\r\nsufficient reason for sending for Sherlock Holmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, that was not sufficient in itself, but another incident\r\nhappened that gives the disappearance of the book a special\r\nsignificance. There was another copy of this book in the National\r\nLibrary at Paris, and the two books differed in certain details relating\r\nto the subterranean passage; for instance, each of them contained\r\ndrawings and annotations, not printed, but written in ink and more or\r\nless effaced. I knew those facts, and I knew that the exact location of\r\nthe passage could be determined only by a comparison of the two books.\r\nNow, the day after my book disappeared, the book was called for in the\r\nNational Library by a reader who carried it away, and no one knows how\r\nthe theft was effected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests uttered many exclamations of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, the affair looks serious,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the police investigated the matter, and, as usual, discovered no\r\nclue whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey never do, when Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is concerned in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; and so I decided to ask the assistance of Sherlock Holmes,\r\nwho replied that he was ready and anxious to enter the lists with Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat glory for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Velmont. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if our national thief,\r\nas they call him, has no evil designs on your castle, Sherlock Holmes\r\nwill have his trip in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are other things that will interest him, such as the discovery of\r\nthe subterranean passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you told us that one end of the passage was outside the ramparts\r\nand the other was in this very room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but in what part of the room? The line which represents the\r\npassage on the charts ends here, with a small circle marked with the\r\nletters \xe2\x80\x98T.G.,\xe2\x80\x99 which no doubt stand for \xe2\x80\x98Tour Guillaume.\xe2\x80\x99 But the tower\r\nis round, and who can tell the exact spot at which the passage touches\r\nthe tower?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDevanne lighted a second cigar and poured himself a glass of\r\nBenedictine. His guests pressed him with questions and he was pleased to\r\nobserve the interest that his remarks had created. Then he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret is lost. No one knows it. The legend is to the effect that\r\nthe former lords of the castle transmitted the secret from father to son\r\non their deathbeds, until Geoffroy, the last of the race, was beheaded\r\nduring the Revolution in his nineteenth year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is over a century ago. Surely, someone has looked for it since\r\nthat time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but they failed to find it. After I purchased the castle, I made a\r\ndiligent search for it, but without success. You must remember that this\r\ntower is surrounded by water and connected with the castle only by a\r\nbridge; consequently, the passage must be underneath the old moat. The\r\nplan that was in the book in the National Library showed a series of\r\nstairs with a total of forty-eight steps, which indicates a depth of\r\nmore than ten meters. You see, the mystery lies within the walls of this\r\nroom, and yet I dislike to tear them down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing to show where it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon. Devanne, we should turn our attention to the two quotations,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n suggested Father G\xc3\xa9lis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mon. Devanne, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cour worthy father is fond\r\nof reading memoirs and delving into the musty archives of the castle.\r\nEverything relating to Thibermesnil interests him greatly. But the\r\nquotations that he mentions only serve to complicate the mystery. He\r\nhas read somewhere that two kings of France have known the key to the\r\npuzzle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo kings of France! Who were they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry the Fourth and Louis the Sixteenth. And the legend runs like\r\nthis: On the eve of the battle of Arques, Henry the Fourth spent the\r\nnight in this castle. At eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, Louise de\r\nTancarville, the prettiest woman in Normandy, was brought into the\r\ncastle through the subterranean passage by Duke Edgard, who, at the\r\nsame time, informed the king of the secret passage. Afterward, the king\r\nconfided the secret to his minister Sully, who, in turn, relates the\r\nstory in his book, \xe2\x80\x9cRoyales Economies d\xe2\x80\x99Etat,\xe2\x80\x9d without making any\r\ncomment upon it, but linking with it this incomprehensible sentence:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Turn one eye on the bee that shakes, the other eye will lead to God!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a brief silence, Velmont laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t throw a dazzling light upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but Father G\xc3\xa9lis claims that Sully concealed the key to the\r\nmystery in this strange sentence in order to keep the secret from the\r\nsecretaries to whom he dictated his memoirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is an ingenious theory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Velmont.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it may be nothing more; I cannot see that it throws any light\r\non the mysterious riddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was it also to receive the visit of a lady that Louis the Sixteenth\r\ncaused the passage to be opened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mon. Devanne. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say is that the king\r\nstopped here one night in 1784, and that the famous Iron Casket found\r\nin the Louvre contained a paper bearing these words in the king\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nwriting: \xe2\x80\x98Thibermesnil 3-4-11.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace Velmont laughed heartily, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last! And now that we have the magic key, where is the man who can\r\nfit it to the invisible lock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaugh as much as you please, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father G\xc3\xa9lis, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am\r\nconfident the solution is contained in those two sentences, and some day\r\nwe will find a man able to interpret them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSherlock Holmes is the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mon. Devanne, \xe2\x80\x9cunless Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\ngets ahead of him. What is your opinion, Velmont?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVelmont arose, placed his hand on Devanne\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and declared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the information furnished by your book and the book of the\r\nNational Library was deficient in a very important detail which you have\r\nnow supplied. I thank you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe missing key. Now that I have it, I can go to work at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nVelmont.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; without losing a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Devanne, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even a second!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Velmont. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-night, before the arrival of\r\nSherlock Holmes, I must plunder your castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no time to lose. Oh! by the way, I can drive you over this\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Dieppe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am going to meet Monsieur and Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Androl and a young lady\r\nof their acquaintance who are to arrive by the midnight train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen addressing the officers, Devanne added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I shall expect to see all of you at breakfast to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe invitation was accepted. The company dispersed, and a few moments\r\nlater Devanne and Velmont were speeding toward Dieppe in an automobile.\r\nDevanne dropped the artist in front of the Casino, and proceeded to the\r\nrailway station. At twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock his friends alighted from the train.\r\nA half hour later the automobile was at the entrance to the castle.\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after a light supper, they retired. The lights were\r\nextinguished, and the castle was enveloped in the darkness and silence\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe moon appeared through a rift in the clouds, and filled the\r\ndrawing-room with its bright white light. But only for a moment. Then\r\nthe moon again retired behind its ethereal draperies, and darkness and\r\nsilence reigned supreme. No sound could be heard, save the monotonous\r\nticking of the clock. It struck two, and then continued its endless\r\nrepetitions of the seconds. Then, three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, something clicked, like the opening and closing of a\r\nsignal-disc that warns the passing train. A thin stream of light flashed\r\nto every corner of the room, like an arrow that leaves behind it a\r\ntrail of light. It shot forth from the central fluting of a column that\r\nsupported the pediment of the bookcase. It rested for a moment on\r\nthe panel opposite like a glittering circle of burnished silver, then\r\nflashed in all directions like a guilty eye that scrutinizes every\r\nshadow. It disappeared for a short time, but burst forth again as a\r\nwhole section of the bookcase revolved on a pivot and disclosed a large\r\nopening like a vault.\r\n\r\nA man entered, carrying an electric lantern. He was followed by a second\r\nman, who carried a coil of rope and various tools. The leader inspected\r\nthe room, listened a moment, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen eight men, stout fellows with resolute faces, entered the room,\r\nand immediately commenced to remove the furnishings. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin passed\r\nquickly from one piece of furniture to another, examined each, and,\r\naccording to its size or artistic value, he directed his men to take it\r\nor leave it. If ordered to be taken, it was carried to the gaping mouth\r\nof the tunnel, and ruthlessly thrust into the bowels of the earth. Such\r\nwas the fate of six armchairs, six small Louis XV chairs, a quantity\r\nof Aubusson tapestries, some candelabra, paintings by Fragonard and\r\nNattier, a bust by Houdon, and some statuettes. Sometimes, Lupin would\r\nlinger before a beautiful chest or a superb picture, and sigh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is too heavy.... too large.... what a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn forty minutes the room was dismantled; and it had been accomplished\r\nin such an orderly manner and with as little noise as if the various\r\narticles had been packed and wadded for the occasion.\r\n\r\nLupin said to the last man who departed by way of the tunnel:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not come back. You understand, that as soon as the auto-van is\r\nloaded, you are to proceed to the grange at Roquefort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, patron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me the motor-cycle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the man had disappeared, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin pushed the section of the\r\nbookcase back into its place, carefully effaced the traces of the men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps, raised a porti\xc3\xa8re, and entered a gallery, which was the only\r\nmeans of communication between the tower and the castle. In the center\r\nof this gallery there was a glass cabinet which had attracted Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattentions. It contained a valuable collection of watches, snuff-boxes,\r\nrings, chatelaines and miniatures of rare and beautiful workmanship. He\r\nforced the lock with a small jimmy, and experienced a great pleasure in\r\nhandling those gold and silver ornaments, those exquisite and delicate\r\nworks of art.\r\n\r\nHe carried a large linen bag, specially prepared for the removal of\r\nsuch knick-knacks. He filled it. Then he filled the pockets of his coat,\r\nwaistcoat and trousers. And he was just placing over his left arm a\r\nnumber of pearl reticules when he heard a slight sound. He listened. No,\r\nhe was not deceived. The noise continued. Then he remembered that, at\r\none end of the gallery, there was a stairway leading to an unoccupied\r\napartment, but which was probably occupied that night by the young lady\r\nwhom Mon. Devanne had brought from Dieppe with his other visitors.\r\n\r\nImmediately he extinguished his lantern, and had scarcely gained the\r\nfriendly shelter of a window-embrasure, when the door at the top of the\r\nstairway was opened and a feeble light illuminated the gallery. He could\r\nfeel--for, concealed by a curtain, he could not see--that a woman was\r\ncautiously descending the upper steps of the stairs. He hoped she would\r\ncome no closer. Yet, she continued to descend, and even advanced some\r\ndistance into the room. Then she uttered a faint cry. No doubt she had\r\ndiscovered the broken and dismantled cabinet.\r\n\r\nShe advanced again. Now he could smell the perfume, and hear the\r\nthrobbing of her heart as she drew closer to the window where he was\r\nconcealed. She passed so close that her skirt brushed against the\r\nwindow-curtain, and Lupin felt that she suspected the presence of\r\nanother, behind her, in the shadow, within reach of her hand. He\r\nthought: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is afraid. She will go away.\xe2\x80\x9d But she did not go. The\r\ncandle, that she carried in her trembling hand, grew brighter. She\r\nturned, hesitated a moment, appeared to listen, then suddenly drew aside\r\nthe curtain.\r\n\r\nThey stood face to face. Ars\xc3\xa8ne was astounded. He murmured,\r\ninvoluntarily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--you--mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Nelly. Miss Nelly! his fellow passenger on the transatlantic\r\nsteamer, who had been the subject of his dreams on that memorable\r\nvoyage, who had been a witness to his arrest, and who, rather than\r\nbetray him, had dropped into the water the Kodak in which he had\r\nconcealed the bank-notes and diamonds. Miss Nelly! that charming\r\ncreature, the memory of whose face had sometimes cheered, sometimes\r\nsaddened the long hours of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt was such an unexpected encounter that brought them face to face in\r\nthat castle at that hour of the night, that they could not move,\r\nnor utter a word; they were amazed, hypnotized, each at the sudden\r\napparition of the other. Trembling with emotion, Miss Nelly staggered to\r\na seat. He remained standing in front of her.\r\n\r\nGradually, he realized the situation and conceived the impression he\r\nmust have produced at that moment with his arms laden with knick-knacks,\r\nand his pockets and a linen sack overflowing with plunder. He was\r\novercome with confusion, and he actually blushed to find himself in\r\nthe position of a thief caught in the act. To her, henceforth, he was\r\na thief, a man who puts his hand in another\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, who steals into\r\nhouses and robs people while they sleep.\r\n\r\nA watch fell upon the floor; then another. These were followed by other\r\narticles which slipped from his grasp one by one. Then, actuated by a\r\nsudden decision, he dropped the other articles into an armchair, emptied\r\nhis pockets and unpacked his sack. He felt very uncomfortable in Nelly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence, and stepped toward her with the intention of speaking to her,\r\nbut she shuddered, rose quickly and fled toward the salon. The porti\xc3\xa8re\r\nclosed behind her. He followed her. She was standing trembling and\r\namazed at the sight of the devastated room. He said to her, at once:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, everything will be returned. The furniture\r\nwill be brought back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, so he repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise it. To-morrow, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Nothing in the world could\r\ninduce me to break that promise....To-morrow, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen followed a long silence that he dared not break, whilst the\r\nagitation of the young girl caused him a feeling of genuine regret.\r\nQuietly, without a word, he turned away, thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope she will go\r\naway. I can\xe2\x80\x99t endure her presence.\xe2\x80\x9d But the young girl suddenly spoke,\r\nand stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen.... footsteps....I hear someone....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with astonishment. She seemed to be overwhelmed by the\r\nthought of approaching peril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must go--you must escape!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause--you must. Oh! do not remain here another minute. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran, quickly, to the door leading to the gallery and listened. No,\r\nthere was no one there. Perhaps the noise was outside. She waited a\r\nmoment, then returned reassured.\r\n\r\nBut Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin had disappeared.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mon. Devanne was informed of the pillage of his castle, he\r\nsaid to himself: It was Velmont who did it, and Velmont is Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\nThat theory explained everything, and there was no other plausible\r\nexplanation. And yet the idea seemed preposterous. It was ridiculous to\r\nsuppose that Velmont was anyone else than Velmont, the famous artist,\r\nand club-fellow of his cousin d\xe2\x80\x99Estevan. So, when the captain of the\r\ngendarmes arrived to investigate the affair, Devanne did not even think\r\nof mentioning his absurd theory.\r\n\r\nThroughout the forenoon there was a lively commotion at the castle.\r\nThe gendarmes, the local police, the chief of police from Dieppe, the\r\nvillagers, all circulated to and fro in the halls, examining every\r\nnook and corner that was open to their inspection. The approach of the\r\nmaneuvering troops, the rattling fire of the musketry, added to the\r\npicturesque character of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary search furnished no clue. Neither the doors nor windows\r\nshowed any signs of having been disturbed. Consequently, the removal of\r\nthe goods must have been effected by means of the secret passage. Yet,\r\nthere were no indications of footsteps on the floor, nor any unusual\r\nmarks upon the walls.\r\n\r\nTheir investigations revealed, however, one curious fact that denoted\r\nthe whimsical character of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin: the famous Chronique of the\r\nsixteenth century had been restored to its accustomed place in the\r\nlibrary and, beside it, there was a similar book, which was none other\r\nthan the volume stolen from the National Library.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the military officers arrived. Devanne welcomed them\r\nwith his usual gayety; for, no matter how much chagrin he might suffer\r\nfrom the loss of his artistic treasures, his great wealth enabled him to\r\nbear his loss philosophically. His guests, Monsieur and Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Androl\r\nand Miss Nelly, were introduced; and it was then noticed that one of the\r\nexpected guests had not arrived. It was Horace Velmont. Would he come?\r\nHis absence had awakened the suspicions of Mon. Devanne. But at twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock he arrived. Devanne exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! here you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, am I not punctual?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Velmont.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I am surprised that you are.... after such a busy night! I\r\nsuppose you know the news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have robbed the castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Velmont, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly as I predicted. But, first escort Miss Underdown to the\r\ndining-room. Mademoiselle, allow me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, as he remarked the extreme agitation of the young girl.\r\nThen, recalling the incident, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! of course, you met Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin on the steamer, before his arrest,\r\nand you are astonished at the resemblance. Is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply. Velmont stood before her, smiling. He bowed. She\r\ntook his proffered arm. He escorted her to her place, and took his seat\r\nopposite her. During the breakfast, the conversation related exclusively\r\nto Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, the stolen goods, the secret passage, and Sherlock\r\nHolmes. It was only at the close of the repast, when the conversation\r\nhad drifted to other subjects, that Velmont took any part in it. Then\r\nhe was, by turns, amusing and grave, talkative and pensive. And all\r\nhis remarks seemed to be directed to the young girl. But she, quite\r\nabsorbed, did not appear to hear them.\r\n\r\nCoffee was served on the terrace overlooking the court of honor and\r\nthe flower garden in front of the principal fa\xc3\xa7ade. The regimental band\r\nplayed on the lawn, and scores of soldiers and peasants wandered through\r\nthe park.\r\n\r\nMiss Nelly had not forgotten, for one moment, Lupin\xe2\x80\x99s solemn promise:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, everything will be returned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock! And the hands of the great clock in the right wing of\r\nthe castle now marked twenty minutes to three. In spite of herself, her\r\neyes wandered to the clock every minute. She also watched Velmont, who\r\nwas calmly swinging to and fro in a comfortable rocking chair.\r\n\r\nTen minutes to three!....Five minutes to three!....Nelly was impatient\r\nand anxious. Was it possible that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin would carry out his\r\npromise at the appointed hour, when the castle, the courtyard, and the\r\npark were filled with people, and at the very moment when the officers\r\nof the law were pursuing their investigations? And yet....Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin\r\nhad given her his solemn promise. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be exactly as he said,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought she, so deeply was she impressed with the authority, energy and\r\nassurance of that remarkable man. To her, it no longer assumed the form\r\nof a miracle, but, on the contrary, a natural incident that must occur\r\nin the ordinary course of events. She blushed, and turned her head.\r\n\r\nThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock! The great clock struck slowly:\r\none.... two.... three....Horace Velmont took out his watch, glanced at the\r\nclock, then returned the watch to his pocket. A few seconds passed in\r\nsilence; and then the crowd in the courtyard parted to give passage\r\nto two wagons, that had just entered the park-gate, each drawn by two\r\nhorses. They were army-wagons, such as are used for the transportation\r\nof provisions, tents, and other necessary military stores. They stopped\r\nin front of the main entrance, and a commissary-sergeant leaped from\r\none of the wagons and inquired for Mon. Devanne. A moment later, that\r\ngentleman emerged from the house, descended the steps, and, under\r\nthe canvas covers of the wagons, beheld his furniture, pictures and\r\nornaments carefully packaged and arranged.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned, the sergeant produced an order that he had received\r\nfrom the officer of the day. By that order, the second company of the\r\nfourth battalion were commanded to proceed to the crossroads of Halleux\r\nin the forest of Arques, gather up the furniture and other articles\r\ndeposited there, and deliver same to Monsieur Georges Devanne, owner of\r\nthe Thibermesnil castle, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Signed: Col. Beauvel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the crossroads,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cwe found everything ready,\r\nlying on the grass, guarded by some passers-by. It seemed very strange,\r\nbut the order was imperative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the officers examined the signature. He declared it a forgery;\r\nbut a clever imitation. The wagons were unloaded, and the goods restored\r\nto their proper places in the castle.\r\n\r\nDuring this commotion, Nelly had remained alone at the extreme end of\r\nthe terrace, absorbed by confused and distracted thoughts. Suddenly, she\r\nobserved Velmont approaching her. She would have avoided him, but the\r\nbalustrade that surrounded the terrace cut off her retreat. She was\r\ncornered. She could not move. A gleam of sunshine, passing through the\r\nscant foliage of a bamboo, lighted up her beautiful golden hair. Some\r\none spoke to her in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I not kept my promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin stood close to her. No one else was near. He repeated, in a\r\ncalm, soft voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I not kept my promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe expected a word of thanks, or at least some slight movement that\r\nwould betray her interest in the fulfillment of his promise. But she\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nHer scornful attitude annoyed Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin; and he realized the vast\r\ndistance that separated him from Miss Nelly, now that she had learned\r\nthe truth. He would gladly have justified himself in her eyes, or at\r\nleast pleaded extenuating circumstances, but he perceived the absurdity\r\nand futility of such an attempt. Finally, dominated by a surging flood\r\nof memories, he murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! how long ago that was! You remember the long hours on the deck of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Provence.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, you carried a rose in your hand, a white rose like\r\nthe one you carry to-day. I asked you for it. You pretended you did\r\nnot hear me. After you had gone away, I found the rose--forgotten, no\r\ndoubt--and I kept it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply. She seemed to be far away. He continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn memory of those happy hours, forget what you have learned since.\r\nSeparate the past from the present. Do not regard me as the man you saw\r\nlast night, but look at me, if only for a moment, as you did in those\r\nfar-off days when I was Bernard d\xe2\x80\x99Andrezy, for a short time. Will you,\r\nplease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes and looked at him as he had requested. Then, without\r\nsaying a word, she pointed to a ring he was wearing on his forefinger.\r\nOnly the ring was visible; but the setting, which was turned toward the\r\npalm of his hand, consisted of a magnificent ruby. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin blushed.\r\nThe ring belonged to Georges Devanne. He smiled bitterly, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right. Nothing can be changed. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is now and always\r\nwill be Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin. To you, he cannot be even so much as a memory.\r\nPardon me....I should have known that any attention I may now offer you\r\nis simply an insult. Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped aside, hat in hand. Nelly passed before him. He was inclined\r\nto detain her and beseech her forgiveness. But his courage failed, and\r\nhe contented himself by following her with his eyes, as he had done when\r\nshe descended the gangway to the pier at New York. She mounted the steps\r\nleading to the door, and disappeared within the house. He saw her no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nA cloud obscured the sun. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin stood watching the imprints of\r\nher tiny feet in the sand. Suddenly, he gave a start. Upon the box which\r\ncontained the bamboo, beside which Nelly had been standing, he saw\r\nthe rose, the white rose which he had desired but dared not ask\r\nfor. Forgotten, no doubt--it, also! But how--designedly or through\r\ndistraction? He seized it eagerly. Some of its petals fell to the\r\nground. He picked them up, one by one, like precious relics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing more to do here. I must\r\nthink of my safety, before Sherlock Holmes arrives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe park was deserted, but some gendarmes were stationed at the\r\npark-gate. He entered a grove of pine trees, leaped over the wall,\r\nand, as a short cut to the railroad station, followed a path across the\r\nfields. After walking about ten minutes, he arrived at a spot where the\r\nroad grew narrower and ran between two steep banks. In this ravine, he\r\nmet a man traveling in the opposite direction. It was a man about fifty\r\nyears of age, tall, smooth-shaven, and wearing clothes of a foreign cut.\r\nHe carried a heavy cane, and a small satchel was strapped across his\r\nshoulder. When they met, the stranger spoke, with a slight English\r\naccent:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, monsieur, is this the way to the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, straight ahead, and turn to the left when you come to\r\nthe wall. They are expecting you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend Devanne told us last night that you were coming, and I\r\nam delighted to be the first to welcome you. Sherlock Holmes has no more\r\nardent admirer than.... myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of irony in his voice that he quickly regretted, for\r\nSherlock Holmes scrutinized him from head to foot with such a keen,\r\npenetrating eye that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin experienced the sensation of being\r\nseized, imprisoned and registered by that look more thoroughly and\r\nprecisely than he had ever been by a camera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy negative is taken now,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand it will be useless to use\r\na disguise with that man. He would look right through it. But, I wonder,\r\nhas he recognized me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey bowed to each other as if about to part. But, at that moment, they\r\nheard a sound of horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, accompanied by a clinking of steel. It\r\nwas the gendarmes. The two men were obliged to draw back against the\r\nembankment, amongst the brushes, to avoid the horses. The gendarmes\r\npassed by, but, as they followed each other at a considerable distance,\r\nthey were several minutes in doing so. And Lupin was thinking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all depends on that question: has he recognized me? If so, he will\r\nprobably take advantage of the opportunity. It is a trying situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the last horseman had passed, Sherlock Holmes stepped forth and\r\nbrushed the dust from his clothes. Then, for a moment, he and Ars\xc3\xa8ne\r\nLupin gazed at each other; and, if a person could have seen them at that\r\nmoment, it would have been an interesting sight, and memorable as the\r\nfirst meeting of two remarkable men, so strange, so powerfully equipped,\r\nboth of superior quality, and destined by fate, through their peculiar\r\nattributes, to hurl themselves one at the other like two equal forces\r\nthat nature opposes, one against the other, in the realms of space.\r\n\r\nThen the Englishman said: \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\r\n\r\nThey parted. Lupin went toward the railway station, and Sherlock Holmes\r\ncontinued on his way to the castle.\r\n\r\nThe local officers had given up the investigation after several hours\r\nof fruitless efforts, and the people at the castle were awaiting the\r\narrival of the English detective with a lively curiosity. At first\r\nsight, they were a little disappointed on account of his commonplace\r\nappearance, which differed so greatly from the pictures they had formed\r\nof him in their own minds. He did not in any way resemble the romantic\r\nhero, the mysterious and diabolical personage that the name of Sherlock\r\nHolmes had evoked in their imaginations. However, Mon. Devanne exclaimed\r\nwith much gusto:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! monsieur, you are here! I am delighted to see you. It is a\r\nlong-deferred pleasure. Really, I scarcely regret what has happened,\r\nsince it affords me the opportunity to meet you. But, how did you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I sent my automobile to meet you at the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn official reception, eh? with music and fireworks! Oh! no, not for\r\nme. That is not the way I do business,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the Englishman.\r\n\r\nThis speech disconcerted Devanne, who replied, with a forced smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, the business has been greatly simplified since I wrote to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe robbery took place last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had not announced my intended visit, it is probable the robbery\r\nwould not have been committed last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, or some other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in that case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLupin would have been trapped,\xe2\x80\x9d said the detective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my furniture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not have been carried away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but my goods are here. They were brought back at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy two army-wagons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes put on his cap and adjusted his satchel. Devanne\r\nexclaimed, anxiously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monsieur, what are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour goods have been returned; Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin is far away--there is\r\nnothing for me to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is. I need your assistance. What happened yesterday, may\r\nhappen again to-morrow, as we do not know how he entered, or how he\r\nescaped, or why, a few hours later, he returned the goods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you don\xe2\x80\x99t know--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea of a problem to be solved quickened the interest of Sherlock\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, let us make a search--at once--and alone, if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDevanne understood, and conducted the Englishman to the salon. In a dry,\r\ncrisp voice, in sentences that seemed to have been prepared in advance,\r\nHolmes asked a number of questions about the events of the preceding\r\nevening, and enquired also concerning the guests and the members of the\r\nhousehold. Then he examined the two volumes of the \xe2\x80\x9cChronique,\xe2\x80\x9d compared\r\nthe plans of the subterranean passage, requested a repetition of the\r\nsentences discovered by Father G\xc3\xa9lis, and then asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas yesterday the first time you have spoken those two sentences to any\r\none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had never communicated then to Horace Velmont?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, order the automobile. I must leave in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; within that time, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin solved the problem that you placed\r\nbefore him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI.... placed before him--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin or Horace Velmont--same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so. Ah! the scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, let us see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Holmes, \xe2\x80\x9clast night at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, you\r\nfurnished Lupin with the information that he lacked, and that he had\r\nbeen seeking for many weeks. During the night, he found time to solve\r\nthe problem, collect his men, and rob the castle. I shall be quite as\r\nexpeditious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked from end to end of the room, in deep thought, then sat down,\r\ncrossed his long legs and closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nDevanne waited, quite embarrassed. Thought he: \xe2\x80\x9cIs the man asleep? Or is\r\nhe only meditating?\xe2\x80\x9d However, he left the room to give some orders, and\r\nwhen he returned he found the detective on his knees scrutinizing the\r\ncarpet at the foot of the stairs in the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook.... there.... spots from a candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right--and quite fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will also find them at the top of the stairs, and around\r\nthe cabinet that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin broke into, and from which he took the\r\nbibelots that he afterward placed in this armchair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you conclude from that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. These facts would doubtless explain the cause for the\r\nrestitution, but that is a side issue that I cannot wait to investigate.\r\nThe main question is the secret passage. First, tell me, is there a\r\nchapel some two or three hundred metres from the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a ruined chapel, containing the tomb of Duke Rollo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your chauffer to wait for us near that chapel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy chauffer hasn\xe2\x80\x99t returned. If he had, they would have informed me. Do\r\nyou think the secret passage runs to the chapel? What reason have--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would ask you, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the detective, \xe2\x80\x9cto furnish me\r\nwith a ladder and a lantern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you require a ladder and a lantern?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDevanne, somewhat disconcerted by this crude logic, rang the bell. The\r\ntwo articles were given with the sternness and precision of military\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace the ladder against the bookcase, to the left of the word\r\nThibermesnil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDevanne placed the ladder as directed, and the Englishman continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore to the left.... to the right....There!....Now, climb up.... All the\r\nletters are in relief, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, turn the letter I one way or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one? There are two of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDevanne took hold of the letter, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, it turns toward the right. Who told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes did not reply to the question, but continued his\r\ndirections:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, take the letter B. Move it back and forth as you would a bolt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDevanne did so, and, to his great surprise, it produced a clicking\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Holmes. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, we will go to the other end of the\r\nword Thibermesnil, try the letter I, and see if it will open like a\r\nwicket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a certain degree of solemnity, Devanne seized the letter. It\r\nopened, but Devanne fell from the ladder, for the entire section of the\r\nbookcase, lying between the first and last letters of the words, turned\r\non a pivot and disclosed the subterranean passage.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes said, coolly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Devanne, as he rose to his feet, \xe2\x80\x9cnot hurt, only\r\nbewildered. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand now.... those letters turn.... the secret\r\npassage opens....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that agree exactly with the formula given by Sully?\r\nTurn one eye on the bee that shakes, the other eye will lead to God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Louis the sixteenth?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Devanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouis the sixteenth was a clever locksmith. I have read a book he wrote\r\nabout combination locks. It was a good idea on the part of the owner of\r\nThibermesnil to show His Majesty a clever bit of mechanism. As an aid\r\nto his memory, the king wrote: 3-4-11, that is to say, the third, fourth\r\nand eleventh letters of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. I understand that. It explains how Lupin got out of the room,\r\nbut it does not explain how he entered. And it is certain he came from\r\nthe outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes lighted his lantern, and stepped into the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! All the mechanism is exposed here, like the works of a clock,\r\nand the reverse side of the letters can be reached. Lupin worked the\r\ncombination from this side--that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof is there of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProof? Why, look at that puddle of oil. Lupin foresaw that the wheels\r\nwould require oiling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he know about the other entrance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs well as I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Holmes. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto that dark passage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but are you sure you can find the way out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my eyes closed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first, they descended twelve steps, then twelve more, and, farther\r\non, two other flights of twelve steps each. Then they walked through a\r\nlong passageway, the brick walls of which showed the marks of successive\r\nrestorations, and, in spots, were dripping with water. The earth, also,\r\nwas very damp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are passing under the pond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Devanne, somewhat nervously.\r\n\r\nAt last, they came to a stairway of twelve steps, followed by three\r\nothers of twelve steps each, which they mounted with difficulty, and\r\nthen found themselves in a small cavity cut in the rock. They could go\r\nno further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Holmes, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing but bare walls. This is\r\nprovoking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Devanne. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen enough to satisfy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Englishman raised his eye and uttered a sigh of relief. There,\r\nhe saw the same mechanism and the same word as before. He had merely to\r\nwork the three letters. He did so, and a block of granite swung out of\r\nplace. On the other side, this granite block formed the tombstone of\r\nDuke Rollo, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cThibermesnil\xe2\x80\x9d was engraved on it in relief.\r\nNow, they were in the little ruined chapel, and the detective said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other eye leads to God; that means, to the chapel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is marvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Devanne, amazed at the clairvoyance and\r\nvivacity of the Englishman. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible that those few words\r\nwere sufficient for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d declared Holmes, \xe2\x80\x9cthey weren\xe2\x80\x99t even necessary. In the chart in\r\nthe book of the National Library, the drawing terminates at the left, as\r\nyou know, in a circle, and at the right, as you do not know, in a cross.\r\nNow, that cross must refer to the chapel in which we now stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Devanne could not believe his ears. It was all so new, so novel to\r\nhim. He exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is incredible, miraculous, and yet of a childish simplicity! How is\r\nit that no one has ever solved the mystery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause no one has ever united the essential elements, that is to\r\nsay, the two books and the two sentences. No one, but Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Father G\xc3\xa9lis and I knew all about those things, and, likewise--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Devanne, everybody cannot solve riddles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been trying for ten years to accomplish what you did in ten\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! I am used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey emerged from the chapel, and found an automobile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there\xe2\x80\x99s an auto waiting for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Devanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours? You said your chauffeur hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey approached the machine, and Mon. Devanne questioned the chauffer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdouard, who gave you orders to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it was Monsieur Velmont.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon. Velmont? Did you meet him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear the railway station, and he told me to come to the chapel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo come to the chapel! What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait for you, monsieur, and your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDevanne and Holmes exchanged looks, and Mon. Devanne said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew the mystery would be a simple one for you. It is a delicate\r\ncompliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smile of satisfaction lighted up the detective\xe2\x80\x99s serious features for\r\na moment. The compliment pleased him. He shook his head, as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clever man! I knew that when I saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met him a short time ago--on my way from the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you knew it was Horace Velmont--I mean, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right. I wonder how it came--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I supposed it was--from a certain ironical speech he made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you allowed him to escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did. And yet I had everything on my side, such as five\r\ngendarmes who passed us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSacrableu!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Devanne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have taken advantage of the\r\nopportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman, haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I encounter\r\nan adversary like Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin, I do not take advantage of chance\r\nopportunities, I create them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut time pressed, and since Lupin had been so kind as to send the\r\nautomobile, they resolved to profit by it. They seated themselves in\r\nthe comfortable limousine; Edouard took his place at the wheel, and away\r\nthey went toward the railway station. Suddenly, Devanne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fell upon\r\na small package in one of the pockets of the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what is that? A package! Whose is it? Why, it is for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is addressed: Sherlock Holmes, from Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman took the package, opened it, and found that it contained\r\na watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with an angry gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA watch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Devanne. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did it come there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe detective did not reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is your watch! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin returns your watch! But, in order to\r\nreturn it, he must have taken it. Ah! I see! He took your watch! That\r\nis a good one! Sherlock Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 watch stolen by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin! Mon Dieu!\r\nthat is funny! Really.... you must excuse me....I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe roared with laughter, unable to control himself. After which, he\r\nsaid, in a tone of earnest conviction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clever man, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman never moved a muscle. On the way to Dieppe, he never\r\nspoke a word, but fixed his gaze on the flying landscape. His silence\r\nwas terrible, unfathomable, more violent than the wildest rage. At the\r\nrailway station, he spoke calmly, but in a voice that impressed one with\r\nthe vast energy and will power of that famous man. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is a clever man, but some day I shall have the pleasure of\r\nplacing on his shoulder the hand I now offer to you, Monsieur Devanne.\r\nAnd I believe that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin and Sherlock Holmes will meet again\r\nsome day. Yes, the world is too small--we will meet--we must meet--and\r\nthen--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                      *****\r\n--The further startling and thrilling adventures of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Lupin will be\r\nfound in the book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes.\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ARS\xc3\x88NE LUPIN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 6133-0.txt or 6133-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/6/1/3/6133/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.

To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
