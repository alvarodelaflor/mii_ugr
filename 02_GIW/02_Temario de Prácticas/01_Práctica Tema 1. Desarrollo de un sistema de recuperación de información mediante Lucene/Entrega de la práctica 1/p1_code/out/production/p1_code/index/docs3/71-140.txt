There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the\r\nexuberance of Marija Berczynskas. The occasion rested heavily upon\r\nMarija\xe2\x80\x99s broad shoulders\xe2\x80\x94it was her task to see that all things went in\r\ndue form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly hither\r\nand thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and\r\nexhorting all day with her tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to\r\nsee that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself.\r\nShe had left the church last of all, and, desiring to arrive first at\r\nthe hall, had issued orders to the coachman to drive faster. When that\r\npersonage had developed a will of his own in the matter, Marija had\r\nflung up the window of the carriage, and, leaning out, proceeded to\r\ntell him her opinion of him, first in Lithuanian, which he did not\r\nunderstand, and then in Polish, which he did. Having the advantage of\r\nher in altitude, the driver had stood his ground and even ventured to\r\nattempt to speak; and the result had been a furious altercation, which,\r\ncontinuing all the way down Ashland Avenue, had added a new swarm of\r\nurchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile.\r\n\r\nThis was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door.\r\nThe music had started up, and half a block away you could hear the dull\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbroom, broom\xe2\x80\x9d of a cello, with the squeaking of two fiddles which vied\r\nwith each other in intricate and altitudinous gymnastics. Seeing the\r\nthrong, Marija abandoned precipitately the debate concerning the\r\nancestors of her coachman, and, springing from the moving carriage,\r\nplunged in and proceeded to clear a way to the hall. Once within, she\r\nturned and began to push the other way, roaring, meantime, \xe2\x80\x9c_Eik! Eik!\r\nUzdaryk-duris!_\xe2\x80\x9d in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound like\r\nfairy music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZ. Graiczunas, Pasilinksminimams darzas. Vynas. Sznapsas. Wines and\r\nLiquors. Union Headquarters\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was the way the signs ran. The\r\nreader, who perhaps has never held much converse in the language of\r\nfar-off Lithuania, will be glad of the explanation that the place was\r\nthe rear room of a saloon in that part of Chicago known as \xe2\x80\x9cback of the\r\nyards.\xe2\x80\x9d This information is definite and suited to the matter of fact;\r\nbut how pitifully inadequate it would have seemed to one who understood\r\nthat it was also the supreme hour of ecstasy in the life of one of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s gentlest creatures, the scene of the wedding feast and the\r\njoy-transfiguration of little Ona Lukoszaite!\r\n\r\nShe stood in the doorway, shepherded by Cousin Marija, breathless from\r\npushing through the crowd, and in her happiness painful to look upon.\r\nThere was a light of wonder in her eyes and her lids trembled, and her\r\notherwise wan little face was flushed. She wore a muslin dress,\r\nconspicuously white, and a stiff little veil coming to her shoulders.\r\nThere were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil, and eleven bright\r\ngreen rose leaves. There were new white cotton gloves upon her hands,\r\nand as she stood staring about her she twisted them together\r\nfeverishly. It was almost too much for her\xe2\x80\x94you could see the pain of\r\ntoo great emotion in her face, and all the tremor of her form. She was\r\nso young\xe2\x80\x94not quite sixteen\xe2\x80\x94and small for her age, a mere child; and she\r\nhad just been married\xe2\x80\x94and married to Jurgis,[1] of all men, to Jurgis\r\nRudkus, he with the white flower in the buttonhole of his new black\r\nsuit, he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands.\r\n\r\n [1] Pronounced _Yoorghis_\r\n\r\n\r\nOna was blue-eyed and fair, while Jurgis had great black eyes with\r\nbeetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his\r\nears\xe2\x80\x94in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible\r\nmarried couples with which Mother Nature so often wills to confound all\r\nprophets, before and after. Jurgis could take up a\r\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty-pound quarter of beef and carry it into a car\r\nwithout a stagger, or even a thought; and now he stood in a far corner,\r\nfrightened as a hunted animal, and obliged to moisten his lips with his\r\ntongue each time before he could answer the congratulations of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nGradually there was effected a separation between the spectators and\r\nthe guests\xe2\x80\x94a separation at least sufficiently complete for working\r\npurposes. There was no time during the festivities which ensued when\r\nthere were not groups of onlookers in the doorways and the corners; and\r\nif any one of these onlookers came sufficiently close, or looked\r\nsufficiently hungry, a chair was offered him, and he was invited to the\r\nfeast. It was one of the laws of the _veselija_ that no one goes\r\nhungry; and, while a rule made in the forests of Lithuania is hard to\r\napply in the stockyards district of Chicago, with its quarter of a\r\nmillion inhabitants, still they did their best, and the children who\r\nran in from the street, and even the dogs, went out again happier. A\r\ncharming informality was one of the characteristics of this\r\ncelebration. The men wore their hats, or, if they wished, they took\r\nthem off, and their coats with them; they ate when and where they\r\npleased, and moved as often as they pleased. There were to be speeches\r\nand singing, but no one had to listen who did not care to; if he\r\nwished, meantime, to speak or sing himself, he was perfectly free. The\r\nresulting medley of sound distracted no one, save possibly alone the\r\nbabies, of which there were present a number equal to the total\r\npossessed by all the guests invited. There was no other place for the\r\nbabies to be, and so part of the preparations for the evening consisted\r\nof a collection of cribs and carriages in one corner. In these the\r\nbabies slept, three or four together, or wakened together, as the case\r\nmight be. Those who were still older, and could reach the tables,\r\nmarched about munching contentedly at meat bones and bologna sausages.\r\n\r\nThe room is about thirty feet square, with whitewashed walls, bare save\r\nfor a calendar, a picture of a race horse, and a family tree in a\r\ngilded frame. To the right there is a door from the saloon, with a few\r\nloafers in the doorway, and in the corner beyond it a bar, with a\r\npresiding genius clad in soiled white, with waxed black mustaches and a\r\ncarefully oiled curl plastered against one side of his forehead. In the\r\nopposite corner are two tables, filling a third of the room and laden\r\nwith dishes and cold viands, which a few of the hungrier guests are\r\nalready munching. At the head, where sits the bride, is a snow-white\r\ncake, with an Eiffel tower of constructed decoration, with sugar roses\r\nand two angels upon it, and a generous sprinkling of pink and green and\r\nyellow candies. Beyond opens a door into the kitchen, where there is a\r\nglimpse to be had of a range with much steam ascending from it, and\r\nmany women, old and young, rushing hither and thither. In the corner to\r\nthe left are the three musicians, upon a little platform, toiling\r\nheroically to make some impression upon the hubbub; also the babies,\r\nsimilarly occupied, and an open window whence the populace imbibes the\r\nsights and sounds and odors.\r\n\r\nSuddenly some of the steam begins to advance, and, peering through it,\r\nyou discern Aunt Elizabeth, Ona\xe2\x80\x99s stepmother\xe2\x80\x94Teta Elzbieta, as they\r\ncall her\xe2\x80\x94bearing aloft a great platter of stewed duck. Behind her is\r\nKotrina, making her way cautiously, staggering beneath a similar\r\nburden; and half a minute later there appears old Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene, with a big yellow bowl of smoking potatoes, nearly as big\r\nas herself. So, bit by bit, the feast takes form\xe2\x80\x94there is a ham and a\r\ndish of sauerkraut, boiled rice, macaroni, bologna sausages, great\r\npiles of penny buns, bowls of milk, and foaming pitchers of beer. There\r\nis also, not six feet from your back, the bar, where you may order all\r\nyou please and do not have to pay for it. \xe2\x80\x9c_Eiksz! Graicziau!_\xe2\x80\x9d screams\r\nMarija Berczynskas, and falls to work herself\xe2\x80\x94for there is more upon\r\nthe stove inside that will be spoiled if it be not eaten.\r\n\r\nSo, with laughter and shouts and endless badinage and merriment, the\r\nguests take their places. The young men, who for the most part have\r\nbeen huddled near the door, summon their resolution and advance; and\r\nthe shrinking Jurgis is poked and scolded by the old folks until he\r\nconsents to seat himself at the right hand of the bride. The two\r\nbridesmaids, whose insignia of office are paper wreaths, come next, and\r\nafter them the rest of the guests, old and young, boys and girls. The\r\nspirit of the occasion takes hold of the stately bartender, who\r\ncondescends to a plate of stewed duck; even the fat policeman\xe2\x80\x94whose\r\nduty it will be, later in the evening, to break up the fights\xe2\x80\x94draws up\r\na chair to the foot of the table. And the children shout and the babies\r\nyell, and every one laughs and sings and chatters\xe2\x80\x94while above all the\r\ndeafening clamor Cousin Marija shouts orders to the musicians.\r\n\r\nThe musicians\xe2\x80\x94how shall one begin to describe them? All this time they\r\nhave been there, playing in a mad frenzy\xe2\x80\x94all of this scene must be\r\nread, or said, or sung, to music. It is the music which makes it what\r\nit is; it is the music which changes the place from the rear room of a\r\nsaloon in back of the yards to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little\r\ncorner of the high mansions of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe little person who leads this trio is an inspired man. His fiddle is\r\nout of tune, and there is no rosin on his bow, but still he is an\r\ninspired man\xe2\x80\x94the hands of the muses have been laid upon him. He plays\r\nlike one possessed by a demon, by a whole horde of demons. You can feel\r\nthem in the air round about him, capering frenetically; with their\r\ninvisible feet they set the pace, and the hair of the leader of the\r\norchestra rises on end, and his eyeballs start from their sockets, as\r\nhe toils to keep up with them.\r\n\r\nTamoszius Kuszleika is his name, and he has taught himself to play the\r\nviolin by practicing all night, after working all day on the \xe2\x80\x9ckilling\r\nbeds.\xe2\x80\x9d He is in his shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold\r\nhorseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy. A\r\npair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to\r\ngive that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band. He is\r\nonly about five feet high, but even so these trousers are about eight\r\ninches short of the ground. You wonder where he can have gotten them or\r\nrather you would wonder, if the excitement of being in his presence\r\nleft you time to think of such things.\r\n\r\nFor he is an inspired man. Every inch of him is inspired\xe2\x80\x94you might\r\nalmost say inspired separately. He stamps with his feet, he tosses his\r\nhead, he sways and swings to and fro; he has a wizened-up little face,\r\nirresistibly comical; and, when he executes a turn or a flourish, his\r\nbrows knit and his lips work and his eyelids wink\xe2\x80\x94the very ends of his\r\nnecktie bristle out. And every now and then he turns upon his\r\ncompanions, nodding, signaling, beckoning frantically\xe2\x80\x94with every inch\r\nof him appealing, imploring, in behalf of the muses and their call.\r\n\r\nFor they are hardly worthy of Tamoszius, the other two members of the\r\norchestra. The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with\r\nblack-rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven\r\nmule; he responds to the whip but feebly, and then always falls back\r\ninto his old rut. The third man is very fat, with a round, red,\r\nsentimental nose, and he plays with his eyes turned up to the sky and a\r\nlook of infinite yearning. He is playing a bass part upon his cello,\r\nand so the excitement is nothing to him; no matter what happens in the\r\ntreble, it is his task to saw out one long-drawn and lugubrious note\r\nafter another, from four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon until nearly the same\r\nhour next morning, for his third of the total income of one dollar per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nBefore the feast has been five minutes under way, Tamoszius Kuszleika\r\nhas risen in his excitement; a minute or two more and you see that he\r\nis beginning to edge over toward the tables. His nostrils are dilated\r\nand his breath comes fast\xe2\x80\x94his demons are driving him. He nods and\r\nshakes his head at his companions, jerking at them with his violin,\r\nuntil at last the long form of the second violinist also rises up. In\r\nthe end all three of them begin advancing, step by step, upon the\r\nbanqueters, Valentinavyczia, the cellist, bumping along with his\r\ninstrument between notes. Finally all three are gathered at the foot of\r\nthe tables, and there Tamoszius mounts upon a stool.\r\n\r\nNow he is in his glory, dominating the scene. Some of the people are\r\neating, some are laughing and talking\xe2\x80\x94but you will make a great mistake\r\nif you think there is one of them who does not hear him. His notes are\r\nnever true, and his fiddle buzzes on the low ones and squeaks and\r\nscratches on the high; but these things they heed no more than they\r\nheed the dirt and noise and squalor about them\xe2\x80\x94it is out of this\r\nmaterial that they have to build their lives, with it that they have to\r\nutter their souls. And this is their utterance; merry and boisterous,\r\nor mournful and wailing, or passionate and rebellious, this music is\r\ntheir music, music of home. It stretches out its arms to them, they\r\nhave only to give themselves up. Chicago and its saloons and its slums\r\nfade away\xe2\x80\x94there are green meadows and sunlit rivers, mighty forests and\r\nsnow-clad hills. They behold home landscapes and childhood scenes\r\nreturning; old loves and friendships begin to waken, old joys and\r\ngriefs to laugh and weep. Some fall back and close their eyes, some\r\nbeat upon the table. Now and then one leaps up with a cry and calls for\r\nthis song or that; and then the fire leaps brighter in Tamoszius\xe2\x80\x99 eyes,\r\nand he flings up his fiddle and shouts to his companions, and away they\r\ngo in mad career. The company takes up the choruses, and men and women\r\ncry out like all possessed; some leap to their feet and stamp upon the\r\nfloor, lifting their glasses and pledging each other. Before long it\r\noccurs to some one to demand an old wedding song, which celebrates the\r\nbeauty of the bride and the joys of love. In the excitement of this\r\nmasterpiece Tamoszius Kuszleika begins to edge in between the tables,\r\nmaking his way toward the head, where sits the bride. There is not a\r\nfoot of space between the chairs of the guests, and Tamoszius is so\r\nshort that he pokes them with his bow whenever he reaches over for the\r\nlow notes; but still he presses in, and insists relentlessly that his\r\ncompanions must follow. During their progress, needless to say, the\r\nsounds of the cello are pretty well extinguished; but at last the three\r\nare at the head, and Tamoszius takes his station at the right hand of\r\nthe bride and begins to pour out his soul in melting strains.\r\n\r\nLittle Ona is too excited to eat. Once in a while she tastes a little\r\nsomething, when Cousin Marija pinches her elbow and reminds her; but,\r\nfor the most part, she sits gazing with the same fearful eyes of\r\nwonder. Teta Elzbieta is all in a flutter, like a hummingbird; her\r\nsisters, too, keep running up behind her, whispering, breathless. But\r\nOna seems scarcely to hear them\xe2\x80\x94the music keeps calling, and the\r\nfar-off look comes back, and she sits with her hands pressed together\r\nover her heart. Then the tears begin to come into her eyes; and as she\r\nis ashamed to wipe them away, and ashamed to let them run down her\r\ncheeks, she turns and shakes her head a little, and then flushes red\r\nwhen she sees that Jurgis is watching her. When in the end Tamoszius\r\nKuszleika has reached her side, and is waving his magic wand above her,\r\nOna\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks are scarlet, and she looks as if she would have to get up\r\nand run away.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis, however, she is saved by Marija Berczynskas, whom the\r\nmuses suddenly visit. Marija is fond of a song, a song of lovers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nparting; she wishes to hear it, and, as the musicians do not know it,\r\nshe has risen, and is proceeding to teach them. Marija is short, but\r\npowerful in build. She works in a canning factory, and all day long she\r\nhandles cans of beef that weigh fourteen pounds. She has a broad Slavic\r\nface, with prominent red cheeks. When she opens her mouth, it is\r\ntragical, but you cannot help thinking of a horse. She wears a blue\r\nflannel shirt-waist, which is now rolled up at the sleeves, disclosing\r\nher brawny arms; she has a carving fork in her hand, with which she\r\npounds on the table to mark the time. As she roars her song, in a voice\r\nof which it is enough to say that it leaves no portion of the room\r\nvacant, the three musicians follow her, laboriously and note by note,\r\nbut averaging one note behind; thus they toil through stanza after\r\nstanza of a lovesick swain\xe2\x80\x99s lamentation:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSudiev\xe2\x80\x99 kvietkeli, tu brangiausis;\r\nSudiev\xe2\x80\x99 ir laime, man biednam,\r\nMatau\xe2\x80\x94paskyre teip Aukszcziausis,\r\nJog vargt ant svieto reik vienam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the song is over, it is time for the speech, and old Dede Antanas\r\nrises to his feet. Grandfather Anthony, Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 father, is not more\r\nthan sixty years of age, but you would think that he was eighty. He has\r\nbeen only six months in America, and the change has not done him good.\r\nIn his manhood he worked in a cotton mill, but then a coughing fell\r\nupon him, and he had to leave; out in the country the trouble\r\ndisappeared, but he has been working in the pickle rooms at Durham\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand the breathing of the cold, damp air all day has brought it back.\r\nNow as he rises he is seized with a coughing fit, and holds himself by\r\nhis chair and turns away his wan and battered face until it passes.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is the custom for the speech at a _veselija_ to be taken\r\nout of one of the books and learned by heart; but in his youthful days\r\nDede Antanas used to be a scholar, and really make up all the love\r\nletters of his friends. Now it is understood that he has composed an\r\noriginal speech of congratulation and benediction, and this is one of\r\nthe events of the day. Even the boys, who are romping about the room,\r\ndraw near and listen, and some of the women sob and wipe their aprons\r\nin their eyes. It is very solemn, for Antanas Rudkus has become\r\npossessed of the idea that he has not much longer to stay with his\r\nchildren. His speech leaves them all so tearful that one of the guests,\r\nJokubas Szedvilas, who keeps a delicatessen store on Halsted Street,\r\nand is fat and hearty, is moved to rise and say that things may not be\r\nas bad as that, and then to go on and make a little speech of his own,\r\nin which he showers congratulations and prophecies of happiness upon\r\nthe bride and groom, proceeding to particulars which greatly delight\r\nthe young men, but which cause Ona to blush more furiously than ever.\r\nJokubas possesses what his wife complacently describes as \xe2\x80\x9cpoetiszka\r\nvaidintuve\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a poetical imagination.\r\n\r\nNow a good many of the guests have finished, and, since there is no\r\npretense of ceremony, the banquet begins to break up. Some of the men\r\ngather about the bar; some wander about, laughing and singing; here and\r\nthere will be a little group, chanting merrily, and in sublime\r\nindifference to the others and to the orchestra as well. Everybody is\r\nmore or less restless\xe2\x80\x94one would guess that something is on their minds.\r\nAnd so it proves. The last tardy diners are scarcely given time to\r\nfinish, before the tables and the debris are shoved into the corner,\r\nand the chairs and the babies piled out of the way, and the real\r\ncelebration of the evening begins. Then Tamoszius Kuszleika, after\r\nreplenishing himself with a pot of beer, returns to his platform, and,\r\nstanding up, reviews the scene; he taps authoritatively upon the side\r\nof his violin, then tucks it carefully under his chin, then waves his\r\nbow in an elaborate flourish, and finally smites the sounding strings\r\nand closes his eyes, and floats away in spirit upon the wings of a\r\ndreamy waltz. His companion follows, but with his eyes open, watching\r\nwhere he treads, so to speak; and finally Valentinavyczia, after\r\nwaiting for a little and beating with his foot to get the time, casts\r\nup his eyes to the ceiling and begins to saw\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBroom! broom! broom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe company pairs off quickly, and the whole room is soon in motion.\r\nApparently nobody knows how to waltz, but that is nothing of any\r\nconsequence\xe2\x80\x94there is music, and they dance, each as he pleases, just as\r\nbefore they sang. Most of them prefer the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-step,\xe2\x80\x9d especially the\r\nyoung, with whom it is the fashion. The older people have dances from\r\nhome, strange and complicated steps which they execute with grave\r\nsolemnity. Some do not dance anything at all, but simply hold each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s hands and allow the undisciplined joy of motion to express\r\nitself with their feet. Among these are Jokubas Szedvilas and his wife,\r\nLucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly as\r\nmuch as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking\r\nslowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of\r\ntoothless and perspiring ecstasy.\r\n\r\nOf these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail of\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored\r\nhandkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs and fancy buttons. All these\r\nthings are carefully avoided by the young, most of whom have learned to\r\nspeak English and to affect the latest style of clothing. The girls\r\nwear ready-made dresses or shirt waists, and some of them look quite\r\npretty. Some of the young men you would take to be Americans, of the\r\ntype of clerks, but for the fact that they wear their hats in the room.\r\nEach of these younger couples affects a style of its own in dancing.\r\nSome hold each other tightly, some at a cautious distance. Some hold\r\ntheir hands out stiffly, some drop them loosely at their sides. Some\r\ndance springily, some glide softly, some move with grave dignity. There\r\nare boisterous couples, who tear wildly about the room, knocking every\r\none out of their way. There are nervous couples, whom these frighten,\r\nand who cry, \xe2\x80\x9cNusfok! Kas yra?\xe2\x80\x9d at them as they pass. Each couple is\r\npaired for the evening\xe2\x80\x94you will never see them change about. There is\r\nAlena Jasaityte, for instance, who has danced unending hours with\r\nJuozas Raczius, to whom she is engaged. Alena is the beauty of the\r\nevening, and she would be really beautiful if she were not so proud.\r\nShe wears a white shirtwaist, which represents, perhaps, half a week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlabor painting cans. She holds her skirt with her hand as she dances,\r\nwith stately precision, after the manner of the _grandes dames_. Juozas\r\nis driving one of Durham\xe2\x80\x99s wagons, and is making big wages. He affects\r\na \xe2\x80\x9ctough\xe2\x80\x9d aspect, wearing his hat on one side and keeping a cigarette\r\nin his mouth all the evening. Then there is Jadvyga Marcinkus, who is\r\nalso beautiful, but humble. Jadvyga likewise paints cans, but then she\r\nhas an invalid mother and three little sisters to support by it, and so\r\nshe does not spend her wages for shirtwaists. Jadvyga is small and\r\ndelicate, with jet-black eyes and hair, the latter twisted into a\r\nlittle knot and tied on the top of her head. She wears an old white\r\ndress which she has made herself and worn to parties for the past five\r\nyears; it is high-waisted\xe2\x80\x94almost under her arms, and not very\r\nbecoming,\xe2\x80\x94but that does not trouble Jadvyga, who is dancing with her\r\nMikolas. She is small, while he is big and powerful; she nestles in his\r\narms as if she would hide herself from view, and leans her head upon\r\nhis shoulder. He in turn has clasped his arms tightly around her, as if\r\nhe would carry her away; and so she dances, and will dance the entire\r\nevening, and would dance forever, in ecstasy of bliss. You would smile,\r\nperhaps, to see them\xe2\x80\x94but you would not smile if you knew all the story.\r\nThis is the fifth year, now, that Jadvyga has been engaged to Mikolas,\r\nand her heart is sick. They would have been married in the beginning,\r\nonly Mikolas has a father who is drunk all day, and he is the only\r\nother man in a large family. Even so they might have managed it (for\r\nMikolas is a skilled man) but for cruel accidents which have almost\r\ntaken the heart out of them. He is a beef-boner, and that is a\r\ndangerous trade, especially when you are on piecework and trying to\r\nearn a bride. Your hands are slippery, and your knife is slippery, and\r\nyou are toiling like mad, when somebody happens to speak to you, or you\r\nstrike a bone. Then your hand slips up on the blade, and there is a\r\nfearful gash. And that would not be so bad, only for the deadly\r\ncontagion. The cut may heal, but you never can tell. Twice now; within\r\nthe last three years, Mikolas has been lying at home with blood\r\npoisoning\xe2\x80\x94once for three months and once for nearly seven. The last\r\ntime, too, he lost his job, and that meant six weeks more of standing\r\nat the doors of the packing houses, at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock on bitter winter\r\nmornings, with a foot of snow on the ground and more in the air. There\r\nare learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that\r\nbeef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have\r\nnever looked into a beef-boner\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nWhen Tamoszius and his companions stop for a rest, as perforce they\r\nmust, now and then, the dancers halt where they are and wait patiently.\r\nThey never seem to tire; and there is no place for them to sit down if\r\nthey did. It is only for a minute, anyway, for the leader starts up\r\nagain, in spite of all the protests of the other two. This time it is\r\nanother sort of a dance, a Lithuanian dance. Those who prefer to, go on\r\nwith the two-step, but the majority go through an intricate series of\r\nmotions, resembling more fancy skating than a dance. The climax of it\r\nis a furious _prestissimo_, at which the couples seize hands and begin\r\na mad whirling. This is quite irresistible, and every one in the room\r\njoins in, until the place becomes a maze of flying skirts and bodies\r\nquite dazzling to look upon. But the sight of sights at this moment is\r\nTamoszius Kuszleika. The old fiddle squeaks and shrieks in protest, but\r\nTamoszius has no mercy. The sweat starts out on his forehead, and he\r\nbends over like a cyclist on the last lap of a race. His body shakes\r\nand throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the\r\nflying showers of notes\xe2\x80\x94there is a pale blue mist where you look to see\r\nhis bowing arm. With a most wonderful rush he comes to the end of the\r\ntune, and flings up his hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a\r\nfinal shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there,\r\nbringing up against the walls of the room.\r\n\r\nAfter this there is beer for every one, the musicians included, and the\r\nrevelers take a long breath and prepare for the great event of the\r\nevening, which is the _acziavimas_. The _acziavimas_ is a ceremony\r\nwhich, once begun, will continue for three or four hours, and it\r\ninvolves one uninterrupted dance. The guests form a great ring, locking\r\nhands, and, when the music starts up, begin to move around in a circle.\r\nIn the center stands the bride, and, one by one, the men step into the\r\nenclosure and dance with her. Each dances for several minutes\xe2\x80\x94as long\r\nas he pleases; it is a very merry proceeding, with laughter and\r\nsinging, and when the guest has finished, he finds himself face to face\r\nwith Teta Elzbieta, who holds the hat. Into it he drops a sum of\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94a dollar, or perhaps five dollars, according to his power, and\r\nhis estimate of the value of the privilege. The guests are expected to\r\npay for this entertainment; if they be proper guests, they will see\r\nthat there is a neat sum left over for the bride and bridegroom to\r\nstart life upon.\r\n\r\nMost fearful they are to contemplate, the expenses of this\r\nentertainment. They will certainly be over two hundred dollars and\r\nmaybe three hundred; and three hundred dollars is more than the year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nincome of many a person in this room. There are able-bodied men here\r\nwho work from early morning until late at night, in ice-cold cellars\r\nwith a quarter of an inch of water on the floor\xe2\x80\x94men who for six or\r\nseven months in the year never see the sunlight from Sunday afternoon\r\ntill the next Sunday morning\xe2\x80\x94and who cannot earn three hundred dollars\r\nin a year. There are little children here, scarce in their teens, who\r\ncan hardly see the top of the work benches\xe2\x80\x94whose parents have lied to\r\nget them their places\xe2\x80\x94and who do not make the half of three hundred\r\ndollars a year, and perhaps not even the third of it. And then to spend\r\nsuch a sum, all in a single day of your life, at a wedding feast! (For\r\nobviously it is the same thing, whether you spend it at once for your\r\nown wedding, or in a long time, at the weddings of all your friends.)\r\n\r\nIt is very imprudent, it is tragic\xe2\x80\x94but, ah, it is so beautiful! Bit by\r\nbit these poor people have given up everything else; but to this they\r\ncling with all the power of their souls\xe2\x80\x94they cannot give up the\r\n_veselija!_ To do that would mean, not merely to be defeated, but to\r\nacknowledge defeat\xe2\x80\x94and the difference between these two things is what\r\nkeeps the world going. The _veselija_ has come down to them from a\r\nfar-off time; and the meaning of it was that one might dwell within the\r\ncave and gaze upon shadows, provided only that once in his lifetime he\r\ncould break his chains, and feel his wings, and behold the sun;\r\nprovided that once in his lifetime he might testify to the fact that\r\nlife, with all its cares and its terrors, is no such great thing after\r\nall, but merely a bubble upon the surface of a river, a thing that one\r\nmay toss about and play with as a juggler tosses his golden balls, a\r\nthing that one may quaff, like a goblet of rare red wine. Thus having\r\nknown himself for the master of things, a man could go back to his toil\r\nand live upon the memory all his days.\r\n\r\nEndlessly the dancers swung round and round\xe2\x80\x94when they were dizzy they\r\nswung the other way. Hour after hour this had continued\xe2\x80\x94the darkness\r\nhad fallen and the room was dim from the light of two smoky oil lamps.\r\nThe musicians had spent all their fine frenzy by now, and played only\r\none tune, wearily, ploddingly. There were twenty bars or so of it, and\r\nwhen they came to the end they began again. Once every ten minutes or\r\nso they would fail to begin again, but instead would sink back\r\nexhausted; a circumstance which invariably brought on a painful and\r\nterrifying scene, that made the fat policeman stir uneasily in his\r\nsleeping place behind the door.\r\n\r\nIt was all Marija Berczynskas. Marija was one of those hungry souls who\r\ncling with desperation to the skirts of the retreating muse. All day\r\nlong she had been in a state of wonderful exaltation; and now it was\r\nleaving\xe2\x80\x94and she would not let it go. Her soul cried out in the words of\r\nFaust, \xe2\x80\x9cStay, thou art fair!\xe2\x80\x9d Whether it was by beer, or by shouting,\r\nor by music, or by motion, she meant that it should not go. And she\r\nwould go back to the chase of it\xe2\x80\x94and no sooner be fairly started than\r\nher chariot would be thrown off the track, so to speak, by the\r\nstupidity of those thrice accursed musicians. Each time, Marija would\r\nemit a howl and fly at them, shaking her fists in their faces, stamping\r\nupon the floor, purple and incoherent with rage. In vain the frightened\r\nTamoszius would attempt to speak, to plead the limitations of the\r\nflesh; in vain would the puffing and breathless ponas Jokubas insist,\r\nin vain would Teta Elzbieta implore. \xe2\x80\x9cSzalin!\xe2\x80\x9d Marija would scream.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPalauk! isz kelio! What are you paid for, children of hell?\xe2\x80\x9d And so,\r\nin sheer terror, the orchestra would strike up again, and Marija would\r\nreturn to her place and take up her task.\r\n\r\nShe bore all the burden of the festivities now. Ona was kept up by her\r\nexcitement, but all of the women and most of the men were tired\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsoul of Marija was alone unconquered. She drove on the dancers\xe2\x80\x94what had\r\nonce been the ring had now the shape of a pear, with Marija at the\r\nstem, pulling one way and pushing the other, shouting, stamping,\r\nsinging, a very volcano of energy. Now and then some one coming in or\r\nout would leave the door open, and the night air was chill; Marija as\r\nshe passed would stretch out her foot and kick the doorknob, and slam\r\nwould go the door! Once this procedure was the cause of a calamity of\r\nwhich Sebastijonas Szedvilas was the hapless victim. Little\r\nSebastijonas, aged three, had been wandering about oblivious to all\r\nthings, holding turned up over his mouth a bottle of liquid known as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpop,\xe2\x80\x9d pink-colored, ice-cold, and delicious. Passing through the\r\ndoorway the door smote him full, and the shriek which followed brought\r\nthe dancing to a halt. Marija, who threatened horrid murder a hundred\r\ntimes a day, and would weep over the injury of a fly, seized little\r\nSebastijonas in her arms and bid fair to smother him with kisses. There\r\nwas a long rest for the orchestra, and plenty of refreshments, while\r\nMarija was making her peace with her victim, seating him upon the bar,\r\nand standing beside him and holding to his lips a foaming schooner of\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there was going on in another corner of the room an\r\nanxious conference between Teta Elzbieta and Dede Antanas, and a few of\r\nthe more intimate friends of the family. A trouble was come upon them.\r\nThe _veselija_ is a compact, a compact not expressed, but therefore\r\nonly the more binding upon all. Every one\xe2\x80\x99s share was different\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\nevery one knew perfectly well what his share was, and strove to give a\r\nlittle more. Now, however, since they had come to the new country, all\r\nthis was changing; it seemed as if there must be some subtle poison in\r\nthe air that one breathed here\xe2\x80\x94it was affecting all the young men at\r\nonce. They would come in crowds and fill themselves with a fine dinner,\r\nand then sneak off. One would throw another\xe2\x80\x99s hat out of the window,\r\nand both would go out to get it, and neither could be seen again. Or\r\nnow and then half a dozen of them would get together and march out\r\nopenly, staring at you, and making fun of you to your face. Still\r\nothers, worse yet, would crowd about the bar, and at the expense of the\r\nhost drink themselves sodden, paying not the least attention to any\r\none, and leaving it to be thought that either they had danced with the\r\nbride already, or meant to later on.\r\n\r\nAll these things were going on now, and the family was helpless with\r\ndismay. So long they had toiled, and such an outlay they had made! Ona\r\nstood by, her eyes wide with terror. Those frightful bills\xe2\x80\x94how they had\r\nhaunted her, each item gnawing at her soul all day and spoiling her\r\nrest at night. How often she had named them over one by one and figured\r\non them as she went to work\xe2\x80\x94fifteen dollars for the hall, twenty-two\r\ndollars and a quarter for the ducks, twelve dollars for the musicians,\r\nfive dollars at the church, and a blessing of the Virgin besides\xe2\x80\x94and so\r\non without an end! Worst of all was the frightful bill that was still\r\nto come from Graiczunas for the beer and liquor that might be consumed.\r\nOne could never get in advance more than a guess as to this from a\r\nsaloon-keeper\xe2\x80\x94and then, when the time came he always came to you\r\nscratching his head and saying that he had guessed too low, but that he\r\nhad done his best\xe2\x80\x94your guests had gotten so very drunk. By him you were\r\nsure to be cheated unmercifully, and that even though you thought\r\nyourself the dearest of the hundreds of friends he had. He would begin\r\nto serve your guests out of a keg that was half full, and finish with\r\none that was half empty, and then you would be charged for two kegs of\r\nbeer. He would agree to serve a certain quality at a certain price, and\r\nwhen the time came you and your friends would be drinking some horrible\r\npoison that could not be described. You might complain, but you would\r\nget nothing for your pains but a ruined evening; while, as for going to\r\nlaw about it, you might as well go to heaven at once. The saloon-keeper\r\nstood in with all the big politics men in the district; and when you\r\nhad once found out what it meant to get into trouble with such people,\r\nyou would know enough to pay what you were told to pay and shut up.\r\n\r\nWhat made all this the more painful was that it was so hard on the few\r\nthat had really done their best. There was poor old ponas Jokubas, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94he had already given five dollars, and did not every one know\r\nthat Jokubas Szedvilas had just mortgaged his delicatessen store for\r\ntwo hundred dollars to meet several months\xe2\x80\x99 overdue rent? And then\r\nthere was withered old poni Aniele\xe2\x80\x94who was a widow, and had three\r\nchildren, and the rheumatism besides, and did washing for the\r\ntradespeople on Halsted Street at prices it would break your heart to\r\nhear named. Aniele had given the entire profit of her chickens for\r\nseveral months. Eight of them she owned, and she kept them in a little\r\nplace fenced around on her backstairs. All day long the children of\r\nAniele were raking in the dump for food for these chickens; and\r\nsometimes, when the competition there was too fierce, you might see\r\nthem on Halsted Street walking close to the gutters, and with their\r\nmother following to see that no one robbed them of their finds. Money\r\ncould not tell the value of these chickens to old Mrs. Jukniene\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nvalued them differently, for she had a feeling that she was getting\r\nsomething for nothing by means of them\xe2\x80\x94that with them she was getting\r\nthe better of a world that was getting the better of her in so many\r\nother ways. So she watched them every hour of the day, and had learned\r\nto see like an owl at night to watch them then. One of them had been\r\nstolen long ago, and not a month passed that some one did not try to\r\nsteal another. As the frustrating of this one attempt involved a score\r\nof false alarms, it will be understood what a tribute old Mrs. Jukniene\r\nbrought, just because Teta Elzbieta had once loaned her some money for\r\na few days and saved her from being turned out of her house.\r\n\r\nMore and more friends gathered round while the lamentation about these\r\nthings was going on. Some drew nearer, hoping to overhear the\r\nconversation, who were themselves among the guilty\xe2\x80\x94and surely that was\r\na thing to try the patience of a saint. Finally there came Jurgis,\r\nurged by some one, and the story was retold to him. Jurgis listened in\r\nsilence, with his great black eyebrows knitted. Now and then there\r\nwould come a gleam underneath them and he would glance about the room.\r\nPerhaps he would have liked to go at some of those fellows with his big\r\nclenched fists; but then, doubtless, he realized how little good it\r\nwould do him. No bill would be any less for turning out any one at this\r\ntime; and then there would be the scandal\xe2\x80\x94and Jurgis wanted nothing\r\nexcept to get away with Ona and to let the world go its own way. So his\r\nhands relaxed and he merely said quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is done, and there is no\r\nuse in weeping, Teta Elzbieta.\xe2\x80\x9d Then his look turned toward Ona, who\r\nstood close to his side, and he saw the wide look of terror in her\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not worry\xe2\x80\x94it will not\r\nmatter to us. We will pay them all somehow. I will work harder.\xe2\x80\x9d That\r\nwas always what Jurgis said. Ona had grown used to it as the solution\r\nof all difficulties\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI will work harder!\xe2\x80\x9d He had said that in Lithuania\r\nwhen one official had taken his passport from him, and another had\r\narrested him for being without it, and the two had divided a third of\r\nhis belongings. He had said it again in New York, when the\r\nsmooth-spoken agent had taken them in hand and made them pay such high\r\nprices, and almost prevented their leaving his place, in spite of their\r\npaying. Now he said it a third time, and Ona drew a deep breath; it was\r\nso wonderful to have a husband, just like a grown woman\xe2\x80\x94and a husband\r\nwho could solve all problems, and who was so big and strong!\r\n\r\nThe last sob of little Sebastijonas has been stifled, and the orchestra\r\nhas once more been reminded of its duty. The ceremony begins again\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthere are few now left to dance with, and so very soon the collection\r\nis over and promiscuous dances once more begin. It is now after\r\nmidnight, however, and things are not as they were before. The dancers\r\nare dull and heavy\xe2\x80\x94most of them have been drinking hard, and have long\r\nago passed the stage of exhilaration. They dance in monotonous measure,\r\nround after round, hour after hour, with eyes fixed upon vacancy, as if\r\nthey were only half conscious, in a constantly growing stupor. The men\r\ngrasp the women very tightly, but there will be half an hour together\r\nwhen neither will see the other\xe2\x80\x99s face. Some couples do not care to\r\ndance, and have retired to the corners, where they sit with their arms\r\nenlaced. Others, who have been drinking still more, wander about the\r\nroom, bumping into everything; some are in groups of two or three,\r\nsinging, each group its own song. As time goes on there is a variety of\r\ndrunkenness, among the younger men especially. Some stagger about in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, whispering maudlin words\xe2\x80\x94others start quarrels upon\r\nthe slightest pretext, and come to blows and have to be pulled apart.\r\nNow the fat policeman wakens definitely, and feels of his club to see\r\nthat it is ready for business. He has to be prompt\xe2\x80\x94for these\r\ntwo-o\xe2\x80\x99clock-in-the-morning fights, if they once get out of hand, are\r\nlike a forest fire, and may mean the whole reserves at the station. The\r\nthing to do is to crack every fighting head that you see, before there\r\nare so many fighting heads that you cannot crack any of them. There is\r\nbut scant account kept of cracked heads in back of the yards, for men\r\nwho have to crack the heads of animals all day seem to get into the\r\nhabit, and to practice on their friends, and even on their families,\r\nbetween times. This makes it a cause for congratulation that by modern\r\nmethods a very few men can do the painfully necessary work of\r\nhead-cracking for the whole of the cultured world.\r\n\r\nThere is no fight that night\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because Jurgis, too, is\r\nwatchful\xe2\x80\x94even more so than the policeman. Jurgis has drunk a great\r\ndeal, as any one naturally would on an occasion when it all has to be\r\npaid for, whether it is drunk or not; but he is a very steady man, and\r\ndoes not easily lose his temper. Only once there is a tight shave\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat is the fault of Marija Berczynskas. Marija has apparently\r\nconcluded about two hours ago that if the altar in the corner, with the\r\ndeity in soiled white, be not the true home of the muses, it is, at any\r\nrate, the nearest substitute on earth attainable. And Marija is just\r\nfighting drunk when there come to her ears the facts about the villains\r\nwho have not paid that night. Marija goes on the warpath straight off,\r\nwithout even the preliminary of a good cursing, and when she is pulled\r\noff it is with the coat collars of two villains in her hands.\r\nFortunately, the policeman is disposed to be reasonable, and so it is\r\nnot Marija who is flung out of the place.\r\n\r\nAll this interrupts the music for not more than a minute or two. Then\r\nagain the merciless tune begins\xe2\x80\x94the tune that has been played for the\r\nlast half-hour without one single change. It is an American tune this\r\ntime, one which they have picked up on the streets; all seem to know\r\nthe words of it\xe2\x80\x94or, at any rate, the first line of it, which they hum\r\nto themselves, over and over again without rest: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the good old\r\nsummertime\xe2\x80\x94in the good old summertime! In the good old summertime\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe good old summertime!\xe2\x80\x9d There seems to be something hypnotic about\r\nthis, with its endlessly recurring dominant. It has put a stupor upon\r\nevery one who hears it, as well as upon the men who are playing it. No\r\none can get away from it, or even think of getting away from it; it is\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and they have danced out all their joy,\r\nand danced out all their strength, and all the strength that unlimited\r\ndrink can lend them\xe2\x80\x94and still there is no one among them who has the\r\npower to think of stopping. Promptly at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock this same Monday\r\nmorning they will every one of them have to be in their places at\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s or Brown\xe2\x80\x99s or Jones\xe2\x80\x99s, each in his working clothes. If one of\r\nthem be a minute late, he will be docked an hour\xe2\x80\x99s pay, and if he be\r\nmany minutes late, he will be apt to find his brass check turned to the\r\nwall, which will send him out to join the hungry mob that waits every\r\nmorning at the gates of the packing houses, from six o\xe2\x80\x99clock until\r\nnearly half-past eight. There is no exception to this rule, not even\r\nlittle Ona\xe2\x80\x94who has asked for a holiday the day after her wedding day, a\r\nholiday without pay, and been refused. While there are so many who are\r\nanxious to work as you wish, there is no occasion for incommoding\r\nyourself with those who must work otherwise.\r\n\r\nLittle Ona is nearly ready to faint\xe2\x80\x94and half in a stupor herself,\r\nbecause of the heavy scent in the room. She has not taken a drop, but\r\nevery one else there is literally burning alcohol, as the lamps are\r\nburning oil; some of the men who are sound asleep in their chairs or on\r\nthe floor are reeking of it so that you cannot go near them. Now and\r\nthen Jurgis gazes at her hungrily\xe2\x80\x94he has long since forgotten his\r\nshyness; but then the crowd is there, and he still waits and watches\r\nthe door, where a carriage is supposed to come. It does not, and\r\nfinally he will wait no longer, but comes up to Ona, who turns white\r\nand trembles. He puts her shawl about her and then his own coat. They\r\nlive only two blocks away, and Jurgis does not care about the carriage.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no farewell\xe2\x80\x94the dancers do not notice them, and all of\r\nthe children and many of the old folks have fallen asleep of sheer\r\nexhaustion. Dede Antanas is asleep, and so are the Szedvilases, husband\r\nand wife, the former snoring in octaves. There is Teta Elzbieta, and\r\nMarija, sobbing loudly; and then there is only the silent night, with\r\nthe stars beginning to pale a little in the east. Jurgis, without a\r\nword, lifts Ona in his arms, and strides out with her, and she sinks\r\nher head upon his shoulder with a moan. When he reaches home he is not\r\nsure whether she has fainted or is asleep, but when he has to hold her\r\nwith one hand while he unlocks the door, he sees that she has opened\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not go to Brown\xe2\x80\x99s today, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispers, as he\r\nclimbs the stairs; and she catches his arm in terror, gasping: \xe2\x80\x9cNo! No!\r\nI dare not! It will ruin us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he answers her again: \xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me; leave it to me. I will earn\r\nmore money\xe2\x80\x94I will work harder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis talked lightly about work, because he was young. They told him\r\nstories about the breaking down of men, there in the stockyards of\r\nChicago, and of what had happened to them afterward\xe2\x80\x94stories to make\r\nyour flesh creep, but Jurgis would only laugh. He had only been there\r\nfour months, and he was young, and a giant besides. There was too much\r\nhealth in him. He could not even imagine how it would feel to be\r\nbeaten. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is well enough for men like you,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_silpnas_, puny fellows\xe2\x80\x94but my back is broad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country. He was the sort of man\r\nthe bosses like to get hold of, the sort they make it a grievance they\r\ncannot get hold of. When he was told to go to a certain place, he would\r\ngo there on the run. When he had nothing to do for the moment, he would\r\nstand round fidgeting, dancing, with the overflow of energy that was in\r\nhim. If he were working in a line of men, the line always moved too\r\nslowly for him, and you could pick him out by his impatience and\r\nrestlessness. That was why he had been picked out on one important\r\noccasion; for Jurgis had stood outside of Brown and Company\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCentral\r\nTime Station\xe2\x80\x9d not more than half an hour, the second day of his arrival\r\nin Chicago, before he had been beckoned by one of the bosses. Of this\r\nhe was very proud, and it made him more disposed than ever to laugh at\r\nthe pessimists. In vain would they all tell him that there were men in\r\nthat crowd from which he had been chosen who had stood there a\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x94yes, many months\xe2\x80\x94and not been chosen yet. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut what sort of men? Broken-down tramps and good-for-nothings,\r\nfellows who have spent all their money drinking, and want to get more\r\nfor it. Do you want me to believe that with these arms\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he would\r\nclench his fists and hold them up in the air, so that you might see the\r\nrolling muscles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat with these arms people will ever let me starve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is plain,\xe2\x80\x9d they would answer to this, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have come from the\r\ncountry, and from very far in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d And this was the fact, for\r\nJurgis had never seen a city, and scarcely even a fair-sized town,\r\nuntil he had set out to make his fortune in the world and earn his\r\nright to Ona. His father, and his father\xe2\x80\x99s father before him, and as\r\nmany ancestors back as legend could go, had lived in that part of\r\nLithuania known as _Brelovicz_, the Imperial Forest. This is a great\r\ntract of a hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been\r\na hunting preserve of the nobility. There are a very few peasants\r\nsettled in it, holding title from ancient times; and one of these was\r\nAntanas Rudkus, who had been reared himself, and had reared his\r\nchildren in turn, upon half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst\r\nof a wilderness. There had been one son besides Jurgis, and one sister.\r\nThe former had been drafted into the army; that had been over ten years\r\nago, but since that day nothing had ever been heard of him. The sister\r\nwas married, and her husband had bought the place when old Antanas had\r\ndecided to go with his son.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a horse\r\nfair a hundred miles from home. Jurgis had never expected to get\r\nmarried\xe2\x80\x94he had laughed at it as a foolish trap for a man to walk into;\r\nbut here, without ever having spoken a word to her, with no more than\r\nthe exchange of half a dozen smiles, he found himself, purple in the\r\nface with embarrassment and terror, asking her parents to sell her to\r\nhim for his wife\xe2\x80\x94and offering his father\xe2\x80\x99s two horses he had been sent\r\nto the fair to sell. But Ona\xe2\x80\x99s father proved as a rock\xe2\x80\x94the girl was yet\r\na child, and he was a rich man, and his daughter was not to be had in\r\nthat way. So Jurgis went home with a heavy heart, and that spring and\r\nsummer toiled and tried hard to forget. In the fall, after the harvest\r\nwas over, he saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney that lay between him and Ona.\r\n\r\nHe found an unexpected state of affairs\xe2\x80\x94for the girl\xe2\x80\x99s father had died,\r\nand his estate was tied up with creditors; Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 heart leaped as he\r\nrealized that now the prize was within his reach. There was Elzbieta\r\nLukoszaite, Teta, or Aunt, as they called her, Ona\xe2\x80\x99s stepmother, and\r\nthere were her six children, of all ages. There was also her brother\r\nJonas, a dried-up little man who had worked upon the farm. They were\r\npeople of great consequence, as it seemed to Jurgis, fresh out of the\r\nwoods; Ona knew how to read, and knew many other things that he did not\r\nknow, and now the farm had been sold, and the whole family was\r\nadrift\xe2\x80\x94all they owned in the world being about seven hundred rubles\r\nwhich is half as many dollars. They would have had three times that,\r\nbut it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and\r\nit had cost the balance to get him to change his decision.\r\n\r\nOna might have married and left them, but she would not, for she loved\r\nTeta Elzbieta. It was Jonas who suggested that they all go to America,\r\nwhere a friend of his had gotten rich. He would work, for his part, and\r\nthe women would work, and some of the children, doubtless\xe2\x80\x94they would\r\nlive somehow. Jurgis, too, had heard of America. That was a country\r\nwhere, they said, a man might earn three rubles a day; and Jurgis\r\nfigured what three rubles a day would mean, with prices as they were\r\nwhere he lived, and decided forthwith that he would go to America and\r\nmarry, and be a rich man in the bargain. In that country, rich or poor,\r\na man was free, it was said; he did not have to go into the army, he\r\ndid not have to pay out his money to rascally officials\xe2\x80\x94he might do as\r\nhe pleased, and count himself as good as any other man. So America was\r\na place of which lovers and young people dreamed. If one could only\r\nmanage to get the price of a passage, he could count his troubles at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that they should leave the following spring, and\r\nmeantime Jurgis sold himself to a contractor for a certain time, and\r\ntramped nearly four hundred miles from home with a gang of men to work\r\nupon a railroad in Smolensk. This was a fearful experience, with filth\r\nand bad food and cruelty and overwork; but Jurgis stood it and came out\r\nin fine trim, and with eighty rubles sewed up in his coat. He did not\r\ndrink or fight, because he was thinking all the time of Ona; and for\r\nthe rest, he was a quiet, steady man, who did what he was told to, did\r\nnot lose his temper often, and when he did lose it made the offender\r\nanxious that he should not lose it again. When they paid him off he\r\ndodged the company gamblers and dramshops, and so they tried to kill\r\nhim; but he escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and\r\nsleeping always with one eye open.\r\n\r\nSo in the summer time they had all set out for America. At the last\r\nmoment there joined them Marija Berczynskas, who was a cousin of Ona\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nMarija was an orphan, and had worked since childhood for a rich farmer\r\nof Vilna, who beat her regularly. It was only at the age of twenty that\r\nit had occurred to Marija to try her strength, when she had risen up\r\nand nearly murdered the man, and then come away.\r\n\r\nThere were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nOna, who was a little of both. They had a hard time on the passage;\r\nthere was an agent who helped them, but he proved a scoundrel, and got\r\nthem into a trap with some officials, and cost them a good deal of\r\ntheir precious money, which they clung to with such horrible fear. This\r\nhappened to them again in New York\xe2\x80\x94for, of course, they knew nothing\r\nabout the country, and had no one to tell them, and it was easy for a\r\nman in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel\r\nand keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away.\r\nThe law says that the rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it\r\ndoes not say that it shall be in Lithuanian.\r\n\r\nIt was in the stockyards that Jonas\xe2\x80\x99 friend had gotten rich, and so to\r\nChicago the party was bound. They knew that one word, Chicago and that\r\nwas all they needed to know, at least, until they reached the city.\r\nThen, tumbled out of the cars without ceremony, they were no better off\r\nthan before; they stood staring down the vista of Dearborn Street, with\r\nits big black buildings towering in the distance, unable to realize\r\nthat they had arrived, and why, when they said \xe2\x80\x9cChicago,\xe2\x80\x9d people no\r\nlonger pointed in some direction, but instead looked perplexed, or\r\nlaughed, or went on without paying any attention. They were pitiable in\r\ntheir helplessness; above all things they stood in deadly terror of any\r\nsort of person in official uniform, and so whenever they saw a\r\npoliceman they would cross the street and hurry by. For the whole of\r\nthe first day they wandered about in the midst of deafening confusion,\r\nutterly lost; and it was only at night that, cowering in the doorway of\r\na house, they were finally discovered and taken by a policeman to the\r\nstation. In the morning an interpreter was found, and they were taken\r\nand put upon a car, and taught a new word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstockyards.\xe2\x80\x9d Their delight\r\nat discovering that they were to get out of this adventure without\r\nlosing another share of their possessions it would not be possible to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nThey sat and stared out of the window. They were on a street which\r\nseemed to run on forever, mile after mile\xe2\x80\x94thirty-four of them, if they\r\nhad known it\xe2\x80\x94and each side of it one uninterrupted row of wretched\r\nlittle two-story frame buildings. Down every side street they could\r\nsee, it was the same\xe2\x80\x94never a hill and never a hollow, but always the\r\nsame endless vista of ugly and dirty little wooden buildings. Here and\r\nthere would be a bridge crossing a filthy creek, with hard-baked mud\r\nshores and dingy sheds and docks along it; here and there would be a\r\nrailroad crossing, with a tangle of switches, and locomotives puffing,\r\nand rattling freight cars filing by; here and there would be a great\r\nfactory, a dingy building with innumerable windows in it, and immense\r\nvolumes of smoke pouring from the chimneys, darkening the air above and\r\nmaking filthy the earth beneath. But after each of these interruptions,\r\nthe desolate procession would begin again\xe2\x80\x94the procession of dreary\r\nlittle buildings.\r\n\r\nA full hour before the party reached the city they had begun to note\r\nthe perplexing changes in the atmosphere. It grew darker all the time,\r\nand upon the earth the grass seemed to grow less green. Every minute,\r\nas the train sped on, the colors of things became dingier; the fields\r\nwere grown parched and yellow, the landscape hideous and bare. And\r\nalong with the thickening smoke they began to notice another\r\ncircumstance, a strange, pungent odor. They were not sure that it was\r\nunpleasant, this odor; some might have called it sickening, but their\r\ntaste in odors was not developed, and they were only sure that it was\r\ncurious. Now, sitting in the trolley car, they realized that they were\r\non their way to the home of it\xe2\x80\x94that they had traveled all the way from\r\nLithuania to it. It was now no longer something far off and faint, that\r\nyou caught in whiffs; you could literally taste it, as well as smell\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94you could take hold of it, almost, and examine it at your leisure.\r\nThey were divided in their opinions about it. It was an elemental odor,\r\nraw and crude; it was rich, almost rancid, sensual, and strong. There\r\nwere some who drank it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were\r\nothers who put their handkerchiefs to their faces. The new emigrants\r\nwere still tasting it, lost in wonder, when suddenly the car came to a\r\nhalt, and the door was flung open, and a voice shouted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cStockyards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street\r\nthere were two rows of brick houses, and between them a vista: half a\r\ndozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very\r\nsky\xe2\x80\x94and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily,\r\nand black as night. It might have come from the center of the world,\r\nthis smoke, where the fires of the ages still smolder. It came as if\r\nself-impelled, driving all before it, a perpetual explosion. It was\r\ninexhaustible; one stared, waiting to see it stop, but still the great\r\nstreams rolled out. They spread in vast clouds overhead, writhing,\r\ncurling; then, uniting in one giant river, they streamed away down the\r\nsky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\nThen the party became aware of another strange thing. This, too, like\r\nthe color, was a thing elemental; it was a sound, a sound made up of\r\nten thousand little sounds. You scarcely noticed it at first\xe2\x80\x94it sunk\r\ninto your consciousness, a vague disturbance, a trouble. It was like\r\nthe murmuring of the bees in the spring, the whisperings of the forest;\r\nit suggested endless activity, the rumblings of a world in motion. It\r\nwas only by an effort that one could realize that it was made by\r\nanimals, that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the\r\ndistant grunting of ten thousand swine.\r\n\r\nThey would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for\r\nadventures just then. The policeman on the corner was beginning to\r\nwatch them; and so, as usual, they started up the street. Scarcely had\r\nthey gone a block, however, before Jonas was heard to give a cry, and\r\nbegan pointing excitedly across the street. Before they could gather\r\nthe meaning of his breathless ejaculations he had bounded away, and\r\nthey saw him enter a shop, over which was a sign: \xe2\x80\x9cJ. Szedvilas,\r\nDelicatessen.\xe2\x80\x9d When he came out again it was in company with a very\r\nstout gentleman in shirt sleeves and an apron, clasping Jonas by both\r\nhands and laughing hilariously. Then Teta Elzbieta recollected suddenly\r\nthat Szedvilas had been the name of the mythical friend who had made\r\nhis fortune in America. To find that he had been making it in the\r\ndelicatessen business was an extraordinary piece of good fortune at\r\nthis juncture; though it was well on in the morning, they had not\r\nbreakfasted, and the children were beginning to whimper.\r\n\r\nThus was the happy ending to a woeful voyage. The two families\r\nliterally fell upon each other\xe2\x80\x99s necks\xe2\x80\x94for it had been years since\r\nJokubas Szedvilas had met a man from his part of Lithuania. Before half\r\nthe day they were lifelong friends. Jokubas understood all the pitfalls\r\nof this new world, and could explain all of its mysteries; he could\r\ntell them the things they ought to have done in the different\r\nemergencies\xe2\x80\x94and what was still more to the point, he could tell them\r\nwhat to do now. He would take them to poni Aniele, who kept a\r\nboardinghouse the other side of the yards; old Mrs. Jukniene, he\r\nexplained, had not what one would call choice accommodations, but they\r\nmight do for the moment. To this Teta Elzbieta hastened to respond that\r\nnothing could be too cheap to suit them just then; for they were quite\r\nterrified over the sums they had had to expend. A very few days of\r\npractical experience in this land of high wages had been sufficient to\r\nmake clear to them the cruel fact that it was also a land of high\r\nprices, and that in it the poor man was almost as poor as in any other\r\ncorner of the earth; and so there vanished in a night all the wonderful\r\ndreams of wealth that had been haunting Jurgis. What had made the\r\ndiscovery all the more painful was that they were spending, at American\r\nprices, money which they had earned at home rates of wages\xe2\x80\x94and so were\r\nreally being cheated by the world! The last two days they had all but\r\nstarved themselves\xe2\x80\x94it made them quite sick to pay the prices that the\r\nrailroad people asked them for food.\r\n\r\nYet, when they saw the home of the Widow Jukniene they could not but\r\nrecoil, even so, in all their journey they had seen nothing so bad as\r\nthis. Poni Aniele had a four-room flat in one of that wilderness of\r\ntwo-story frame tenements that lie \xe2\x80\x9cback of the yards.\xe2\x80\x9d There were four\r\nsuch flats in each building, and each of the four was a \xe2\x80\x9cboardinghouse\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor the occupancy of foreigners\xe2\x80\x94Lithuanians, Poles, Slovaks, or\r\nBohemians. Some of these places were kept by private persons, some were\r\ncooperative. There would be an average of half a dozen boarders to each\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94sometimes there were thirteen or fourteen to one room, fifty or\r\nsixty to a flat. Each one of the occupants furnished his own\r\naccommodations\xe2\x80\x94that is, a mattress and some bedding. The mattresses\r\nwould be spread upon the floor in rows\xe2\x80\x94and there would be nothing else\r\nin the place except a stove. It was by no means unusual for two men to\r\nown the same mattress in common, one working by day and using it by\r\nnight, and the other working at night and using it in the daytime. Very\r\nfrequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double\r\nshifts of men.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face. Her\r\nhome was unthinkably filthy; you could not enter by the front door at\r\nall, owing to the mattresses, and when you tried to go up the\r\nbackstairs you found that she had walled up most of the porch with old\r\nboards to make a place to keep her chickens. It was a standing jest of\r\nthe boarders that Aniele cleaned house by letting the chickens loose in\r\nthe rooms. Undoubtedly this did keep down the vermin, but it seemed\r\nprobable, in view of all the circumstances, that the old lady regarded\r\nit rather as feeding the chickens than as cleaning the rooms. The truth\r\nwas that she had definitely given up the idea of cleaning anything,\r\nunder pressure of an attack of rheumatism, which had kept her doubled\r\nup in one corner of her room for over a week; during which time eleven\r\nof her boarders, heavily in her debt, had concluded to try their\r\nchances of employment in Kansas City. This was July, and the fields\r\nwere green. One never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever, in\r\nPackingtown; but one could go out on the road and \xe2\x80\x9chobo it,\xe2\x80\x9d as the men\r\nphrased it, and see the country, and have a long rest, and an easy time\r\nriding on the freight cars.\r\n\r\nSuch was the home to which the new arrivals were welcomed. There was\r\nnothing better to be had\xe2\x80\x94they might not do so well by looking further,\r\nfor Mrs. Jukniene had at least kept one room for herself and her three\r\nlittle children, and now offered to share this with the women and the\r\ngirls of the party. They could get bedding at a secondhand store, she\r\nexplained; and they would not need any, while the weather was so\r\nhot\xe2\x80\x94doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such nights as this,\r\nas did nearly all of her guests. \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis said, when they\r\nwere left alone, \xe2\x80\x9ctomorrow I will get a job, and perhaps Jonas will get\r\none also; and then we can get a place of our own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLater that afternoon he and Ona went out to take a walk and look about\r\nthem, to see more of this district which was to be their home. In back\r\nof the yards the dreary two-story frame houses were scattered farther\r\napart, and there were great spaces bare\xe2\x80\x94that seemingly had been\r\noverlooked by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the\r\nsurface of the prairie. These bare places were grown up with dingy,\r\nyellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans; innumerable children\r\nplayed upon them, chasing one another here and there, screaming and\r\nfighting. The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number\r\nof the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it\r\nwas only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that\r\nthere was no school, but that these were the children of the\r\nneighborhood\xe2\x80\x94that there were so many children to the block in\r\nPackingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move\r\nfaster than a walk!\r\n\r\nIt could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the\r\nstreets. Those through which Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled\r\nstreets less than they did a miniature topographical map. The roadway\r\nwas commonly several feet lower than the level of the houses, which\r\nwere sometimes joined by high board walks; there were no\r\npavements\xe2\x80\x94there were mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and\r\nditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water. In these pools\r\nthe children played, and rolled about in the mud of the streets; here\r\nand there one noticed them digging in it, after trophies which they had\r\nstumbled on. One wondered about this, as also about the swarms of flies\r\nwhich hung about the scene, literally blackening the air, and the\r\nstrange, fetid odor which assailed one\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils, a ghastly odor, of\r\nall the dead things of the universe. It impelled the visitor to\r\nquestions and then the residents would explain, quietly, that all this\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cmade\xe2\x80\x9d land, and that it had been \xe2\x80\x9cmade\xe2\x80\x9d by using it as a dumping\r\nground for the city garbage. After a few years the unpleasant effect of\r\nthis would pass away, it was said; but meantime, in hot weather\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nespecially when it rained\xe2\x80\x94the flies were apt to be annoying. Was it not\r\nunhealthful? the stranger would ask, and the residents would answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps; but there is no telling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little way farther on, and Jurgis and Ona, staring open-eyed and\r\nwondering, came to the place where this \xe2\x80\x9cmade\xe2\x80\x9d ground was in process of\r\nmaking. Here was a great hole, perhaps two city blocks square, and with\r\nlong files of garbage wagons creeping into it. The place had an odor\r\nfor which there are no polite words; and it was sprinkled over with\r\nchildren, who raked in it from dawn till dark. Sometimes visitors from\r\nthe packing houses would wander out to see this \xe2\x80\x9cdump,\xe2\x80\x9d and they would\r\nstand by and debate as to whether the children were eating the food\r\nthey got, or merely collecting it for the chickens at home. Apparently\r\nnone of them ever went down to find out.\r\n\r\nBeyond this dump there stood a great brickyard, with smoking chimneys.\r\nFirst they took out the soil to make bricks, and then they filled it up\r\nagain with garbage, which seemed to Jurgis and Ona a felicitous\r\narrangement, characteristic of an enterprising country like America. A\r\nlittle way beyond was another great hole, which they had emptied and\r\nnot yet filled up. This held water, and all summer it stood there, with\r\nthe near-by soil draining into it, festering and stewing in the sun;\r\nand then, when winter came, somebody cut the ice on it, and sold it to\r\nthe people of the city. This, too, seemed to the newcomers an\r\neconomical arrangement; for they did not read the newspapers, and their\r\nheads were not full of troublesome thoughts about \xe2\x80\x9cgerms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood there while the sun went down upon this scene, and the sky\r\nin the west turned blood-red, and the tops of the houses shone like\r\nfire. Jurgis and Ona were not thinking of the sunset, however\xe2\x80\x94their\r\nbacks were turned to it, and all their thoughts were of Packingtown,\r\nwhich they could see so plainly in the distance. The line of the\r\nbuildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out\r\nof the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming\r\naway to the end of the world. It was a study in colors now, this smoke;\r\nin the sunset light it was black and brown and gray and purple. All the\r\nsordid suggestions of the place were gone\xe2\x80\x94in the twilight it was a\r\nvision of power. To the two who stood watching while the darkness\r\nswallowed it up, it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human\r\nenergy, of things being done, of employment for thousands upon\r\nthousands of men, of opportunity and freedom, of life and love and joy.\r\nWhen they came away, arm in arm, Jurgis was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow I shall\r\ngo there and get a job!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his capacity as delicatessen vender, Jokubas Szedvilas had many\r\nacquaintances. Among these was one of the special policemen employed by\r\nDurham, whose duty it frequently was to pick out men for employment.\r\nJokubas had never tried it, but he expressed a certainty that he could\r\nget some of his friends a job through this man. It was agreed, after\r\nconsultation, that he should make the effort with old Antanas and with\r\nJonas. Jurgis was confident of his ability to get work for himself,\r\nunassisted by any one. As we have said before, he was not mistaken in\r\nthis. He had gone to Brown\xe2\x80\x99s and stood there not more than half an hour\r\nbefore one of the bosses noticed his form towering above the rest, and\r\nsignaled to him. The colloquy which followed was brief and to the\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; Lit-uanian.\xe2\x80\x9d (Jurgis had studied this word carefully.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe.\xe2\x80\x9d (A nod.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorked here before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo \xe2\x80\x99stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Signals and gesticulations on the part of the boss. Vigorous shakes of\r\nthe head by Jurgis.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShovel guts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo \xe2\x80\x99stand.\xe2\x80\x9d (More shakes of the head.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZarnos.

Jurgis turned\r\naway, and then in a sudden rush the full realization of his triumph\r\nswept over him, and he gave a yell and a jump, and started off on a\r\nrun. He had a job! He had a job! And he went all the way home as if\r\nupon wings, and burst into the house like a cyclone, to the rage of the\r\nnumerous lodgers who had just turned in for their daily sleep.\r\n\r\nMeantime Jokubas had been to see his friend the policeman, and received\r\nencouragement, so it was a happy party. There being no more to be done\r\nthat day, the shop was left under the care of Lucija, and her husband\r\nsallied forth to show his friends the sights of Packingtown. Jokubas\r\ndid this with the air of a country gentleman escorting a party of\r\nvisitors over his estate; he was an old-time resident, and all these\r\nwonders had grown up under his eyes, and he had a personal pride in\r\nthem. The packers might own the land, but he claimed the landscape, and\r\nthere was no one to say nay to this.\r\n\r\nThey passed down the busy street that led to the yards. It was still\r\nearly morning, and everything was at its high tide of activity. A\r\nsteady stream of employees was pouring through the gate\xe2\x80\x94employees of\r\nthe higher sort, at this hour, clerks and stenographers and such. For\r\nthe women there were waiting big two-horse wagons, which set off at a\r\ngallop as fast as they were filled. In the distance there was heard\r\nagain the lowing of the cattle, a sound as of a far-off ocean calling.\r\nThey followed it, this time, as eager as children in sight of a circus\r\nmenagerie\xe2\x80\x94which, indeed, the scene a good deal resembled. They crossed\r\nthe railroad tracks, and then on each side of the street were the pens\r\nfull of cattle; they would have stopped to look, but Jokubas hurried\r\nthem on, to where there was a stairway and a raised gallery, from which\r\neverything could be seen. Here they stood, staring, breathless with\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nThere is over a square mile of space in the yards, and more than half\r\nof it is occupied by cattle pens; north and south as far as the eye can\r\nreach there stretches a sea of pens. And they were all filled\xe2\x80\x94so many\r\ncattle no one had ever dreamed existed in the world. Red cattle, black,\r\nwhite, and yellow cattle; old cattle and young cattle; great bellowing\r\nbulls and little calves not an hour born; meek-eyed milch cows and\r\nfierce, long-horned Texas steers. The sound of them here was as of all\r\nthe barnyards of the universe; and as for counting them\xe2\x80\x94it would have\r\ntaken all day simply to count the pens. Here and there ran long alleys,\r\nblocked at intervals by gates; and Jokubas told them that the number of\r\nthese gates was twenty-five thousand. Jokubas had recently been reading\r\na newspaper article which was full of statistics such as that, and he\r\nwas very proud as he repeated them and made his guests cry out with\r\nwonder. Jurgis too had a little of this sense of pride. Had he not just\r\ngotten a job, and become a sharer in all this activity, a cog in this\r\nmarvelous machine? Here and there about the alleys galloped men upon\r\nhorseback, booted, and carrying long whips; they were very busy,\r\ncalling to each other, and to those who were driving the cattle. They\r\nwere drovers and stock raisers, who had come from far states, and\r\nbrokers and commission merchants, and buyers for all the big packing\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nHere and there they would stop to inspect a bunch of cattle, and there\r\nwould be a parley, brief and businesslike. The buyer would nod or drop\r\nhis whip, and that would mean a bargain; and he would note it in his\r\nlittle book, along with hundreds of others he had made that morning.\r\nThen Jokubas pointed out the place where the cattle were driven to be\r\nweighed, upon a great scale that would weigh a hundred thousand pounds\r\nat once and record it automatically. It was near to the east entrance\r\nthat they stood, and all along this east side of the yards ran the\r\nrailroad tracks, into which the cars were run, loaded with cattle. All\r\nnight long this had been going on, and now the pens were full; by\r\ntonight they would all be empty, and the same thing would be done\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will become of all these creatures?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Teta Elzbieta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Jokubas answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will all be killed and cut up;\r\nand over there on the other side of the packing houses are more\r\nrailroad tracks, where the cars come to take them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were two hundred and fifty miles of track within the yards, their\r\nguide went on to tell them. They brought about ten thousand head of\r\ncattle every day, and as many hogs, and half as many sheep\xe2\x80\x94which meant\r\nsome eight or ten million live creatures turned into food every year.\r\nOne stood and watched, and little by little caught the drift of the\r\ntide, as it set in the direction of the packing houses. There were\r\ngroups of cattle being driven to the chutes, which were roadways about\r\nfifteen feet wide, raised high above the pens. In these chutes the\r\nstream of animals was continuous; it was quite uncanny to watch them,\r\npressing on to their fate, all unsuspicious a very river of death. Our\r\nfriends were not poetical, and the sight suggested to them no metaphors\r\nof human destiny; they thought only of the wonderful efficiency of it\r\nall. The chutes into which the hogs went climbed high up\xe2\x80\x94to the very\r\ntop of the distant buildings; and Jokubas explained that the hogs went\r\nup by the power of their own legs, and then their weight carried them\r\nback through all the processes necessary to make them into pork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t waste anything here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guide, and then he laughed\r\nand added a witticism, which he was pleased that his unsophisticated\r\nfriends should take to be his own: \xe2\x80\x9cThey use everything about the hog\r\nexcept the squeal.\xe2\x80\x9d In front of Brown\xe2\x80\x99s General Office building there\r\ngrows a tiny plot of grass, and this, you may learn, is the only bit of\r\ngreen thing in Packingtown; likewise this jest about the hog and his\r\nsqueal, the stock in trade of all the guides, is the one gleam of humor\r\nthat you will find there.\r\n\r\nAfter they had seen enough of the pens, the party went up the street,\r\nto the mass of buildings which occupy the center of the yards. These\r\nbuildings, made of brick and stained with innumerable layers of\r\nPackingtown smoke, were painted all over with advertising signs, from\r\nwhich the visitor realized suddenly that he had come to the home of\r\nmany of the torments of his life. It was here that they made those\r\nproducts with the wonders of which they pestered him so\xe2\x80\x94by placards\r\nthat defaced the landscape when he traveled, and by staring\r\nadvertisements in the newspapers and magazines\xe2\x80\x94by silly little jingles\r\nthat he could not get out of his mind, and gaudy pictures that lurked\r\nfor him around every street corner. Here was where they made Brown\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nImperial Hams and Bacon, Brown\xe2\x80\x99s Dressed Beef, Brown\xe2\x80\x99s Excelsior\r\nSausages! Here was the headquarters of Durham\xe2\x80\x99s Pure Leaf Lard, of\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s Breakfast Bacon, Durham\xe2\x80\x99s Canned Beef, Potted Ham, Deviled\r\nChicken, Peerless Fertilizer!\r\n\r\nEntering one of the Durham buildings, they found a number of other\r\nvisitors waiting; and before long there came a guide, to escort them\r\nthrough the place. They make a great feature of showing strangers\r\nthrough the packing plants, for it is a good advertisement. But Ponas\r\nJokubas whispered maliciously that the visitors did not see any more\r\nthan the packers wanted them to. They climbed a long series of\r\nstairways outside of the building, to the top of its five or six\r\nstories. Here was the chute, with its river of hogs, all patiently\r\ntoiling upward; there was a place for them to rest to cool off, and\r\nthen through another passageway they went into a room from which there\r\nis no returning for hogs.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, narrow room, with a gallery along it for visitors. At\r\nthe head there was a great iron wheel, about twenty feet in\r\ncircumference, with rings here and there along its edge. Upon both\r\nsides of this wheel there was a narrow space, into which came the hogs\r\nat the end of their journey; in the midst of them stood a great burly\r\nNegro, bare-armed and bare-chested. He was resting for the moment, for\r\nthe wheel had stopped while men were cleaning up. In a minute or two,\r\nhowever, it began slowly to revolve, and then the men upon each side of\r\nit sprang to work. They had chains which they fastened about the leg of\r\nthe nearest hog, and the other end of the chain they hooked into one of\r\nthe rings upon the wheel. So, as the wheel turned, a hog was suddenly\r\njerked off his feet and borne aloft.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the car was assailed by a most terrifying shriek;\r\nthe visitors started in alarm, the women turned pale and shrank back.\r\nThe shriek was followed by another, louder and yet more agonizing\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nonce started upon that journey, the hog never came back; at the top of\r\nthe wheel he was shunted off upon a trolley, and went sailing down the\r\nroom. And meantime another was swung up, and then another, and another,\r\nuntil there was a double line of them, each dangling by a foot and\r\nkicking in frenzy\xe2\x80\x94and squealing. The uproar was appalling, perilous to\r\nthe eardrums; one feared there was too much sound for the room to\r\nhold\xe2\x80\x94that the walls must give way or the ceiling crack. There were high\r\nsqueals and low squeals, grunts, and wails of agony; there would come a\r\nmomentary lull, and then a fresh outburst, louder than ever, surging up\r\nto a deafening climax. It was too much for some of the visitors\xe2\x80\x94the men\r\nwould look at each other, laughing nervously, and the women would stand\r\nwith hands clenched, and the blood rushing to their faces, and the\r\ntears starting in their eyes.\r\n\r\nMeantime, heedless of all these things, the men upon the floor were\r\ngoing about their work. Neither squeals of hogs nor tears of visitors\r\nmade any difference to them; one by one they hooked up the hogs, and\r\none by one with a swift stroke they slit their throats. There was a\r\nlong line of hogs, with squeals and lifeblood ebbing away together;\r\nuntil at last each started again, and vanished with a splash into a\r\nhuge vat of boiling water.\r\n\r\nIt was all so very businesslike that one watched it fascinated. It was\r\nporkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics. And yet\r\nsomehow the most matter-of-fact person could not help thinking of the\r\nhogs; they were so innocent, they came so very trustingly; and they\r\nwere so very human in their protests\xe2\x80\x94and so perfectly within their\r\nrights! They had done nothing to deserve it; and it was adding insult\r\nto injury, as the thing was done here, swinging them up in this\r\ncold-blooded, impersonal way, without a pretense of apology, without\r\nthe homage of a tear. Now and then a visitor wept, to be sure; but this\r\nslaughtering machine ran on, visitors or no visitors. It was like some\r\nhorrible crime committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded, buried\r\nout of sight and of memory.\r\n\r\nOne could not stand and watch very long without becoming philosophical,\r\nwithout beginning to deal in symbols and similes, and to hear the hog\r\nsqueal of the universe. Was it permitted to believe that there was\r\nnowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where\r\nthey were requited for all this suffering? Each one of these hogs was a\r\nseparate creature. Some were white hogs, some were black; some were\r\nbrown, some were spotted; some were old, some young; some were long and\r\nlean, some were monstrous. And each of them had an individuality of his\r\nown, a will of his own, a hope and a heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire; each was full of\r\nself-confidence, of self-importance, and a sense of dignity. And\r\ntrusting and strong in faith he had gone about his business, the while\r\na black shadow hung over him and a horrid Fate waited in his pathway.\r\nNow suddenly it had swooped upon him, and had seized him by the leg.\r\nRelentless, remorseless, it was; all his protests, his screams, were\r\nnothing to it\xe2\x80\x94it did its cruel will with him, as if his wishes, his\r\nfeelings, had simply no existence at all; it cut his throat and watched\r\nhim gasp out his life. And now was one to believe that there was\r\nnowhere a god of hogs, to whom this hog personality was precious, to\r\nwhom these hog squeals and agonies had a meaning? Who would take this\r\nhog into his arms and comfort him, reward him for his work well done,\r\nand show him the meaning of his sacrifice? Perhaps some glimpse of all\r\nthis was in the thoughts of our humble-minded Jurgis, as he turned to\r\ngo on with the rest of the party, and muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cDieve\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot a hog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carcass hog was scooped out of the vat by machinery, and then it\r\nfell to the second floor, passing on the way through a wonderful\r\nmachine with numerous scrapers, which adjusted themselves to the size\r\nand shape of the animal, and sent it out at the other end with nearly\r\nall of its bristles removed. It was then again strung up by machinery,\r\nand sent upon another trolley ride; this time passing between two lines\r\nof men, who sat upon a raised platform, each doing a certain single\r\nthing to the carcass as it came to him. One scraped the outside of a\r\nleg; another scraped the inside of the same leg. One with a swift\r\nstroke cut the throat; another with two swift strokes severed the head,\r\nwhich fell to the floor and vanished through a hole. Another made a\r\nslit down the body; a second opened the body wider; a third with a saw\r\ncut the breastbone; a fourth loosened the entrails; a fifth pulled them\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94and they also slid through a hole in the floor. There were men to\r\nscrape each side and men to scrape the back; there were men to clean\r\nthe carcass inside, to trim it and wash it. Looking down this room, one\r\nsaw, creeping slowly, a line of dangling hogs a hundred yards in\r\nlength; and for every yard there was a man, working as if a demon were\r\nafter him. At the end of this hog\xe2\x80\x99s progress every inch of the carcass\r\nhad been gone over several times; and then it was rolled into the\r\nchilling room, where it stayed for twenty-four hours, and where a\r\nstranger might lose himself in a forest of freezing hogs.\r\n\r\nBefore the carcass was admitted here, however, it had to pass a\r\ngovernment inspector, who sat in the doorway and felt of the glands in\r\nthe neck for tuberculosis. This government inspector did not have the\r\nmanner of a man who was worked to death; he was apparently not haunted\r\nby a fear that the hog might get by him before he had finished his\r\ntesting. If you were a sociable person, he was quite willing to enter\r\ninto conversation with you, and to explain to you the deadly nature of\r\nthe ptomaines which are found in tubercular pork; and while he was\r\ntalking with you you could hardly be so ungrateful as to notice that a\r\ndozen carcasses were passing him untouched. This inspector wore a blue\r\nuniform, with brass buttons, and he gave an atmosphere of authority to\r\nthe scene, and, as it were, put the stamp of official approval upon the\r\nthings which were done in Durham\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nJurgis went down the line with the rest of the visitors, staring\r\nopen-mouthed, lost in wonder. He had dressed hogs himself in the forest\r\nof Lithuania; but he had never expected to live to see one hog dressed\r\nby several hundred men. It was like a wonderful poem to him, and he\r\ntook it all in guilelessly\xe2\x80\x94even to the conspicuous signs demanding\r\nimmaculate cleanliness of the employees. Jurgis was vexed when the\r\ncynical Jokubas translated these signs with sarcastic comments,\r\noffering to take them to the secret rooms where the spoiled meats went\r\nto be doctored.\r\n\r\nThe party descended to the next floor, where the various waste\r\nmaterials were treated. Here came the entrails, to be scraped and\r\nwashed clean for sausage casings; men and women worked here in the\r\nmidst of a sickening stench, which caused the visitors to hasten by,\r\ngasping. To another room came all the scraps to be \xe2\x80\x9ctanked,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nmeant boiling and pumping off the grease to make soap and lard; below\r\nthey took out the refuse, and this, too, was a region in which the\r\nvisitors did not linger. In still other places men were engaged in\r\ncutting up the carcasses that had been through the chilling rooms.\r\nFirst there were the \xe2\x80\x9csplitters,\xe2\x80\x9d the most expert workmen in the plant,\r\nwho earned as high as fifty cents an hour, and did not a thing all day\r\nexcept chop hogs down the middle. Then there were \xe2\x80\x9ccleaver men,\xe2\x80\x9d great\r\ngiants with muscles of iron; each had two men to attend him\xe2\x80\x94to slide\r\nthe half carcass in front of him on the table, and hold it while he\r\nchopped it, and then turn each piece so that he might chop it once\r\nmore. His cleaver had a blade about two feet long, and he never made\r\nbut one cut; he made it so neatly, too, that his implement did not\r\nsmite through and dull itself\xe2\x80\x94there was just enough force for a perfect\r\ncut, and no more. So through various yawning holes there slipped to the\r\nfloor below\xe2\x80\x94to one room hams, to another forequarters, to another sides\r\nof pork. One might go down to this floor and see the pickling rooms,\r\nwhere the hams were put into vats, and the great smoke rooms, with\r\ntheir airtight iron doors. In other rooms they prepared salt pork\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwere whole cellars full of it, built up in great towers to the ceiling.\r\nIn yet other rooms they were putting up meats in boxes and barrels, and\r\nwrapping hams and bacon in oiled paper, sealing and labeling and sewing\r\nthem. From the doors of these rooms went men with loaded trucks, to the\r\nplatform where freight cars were waiting to be filled; and one went out\r\nthere and realized with a start that he had come at last to the ground\r\nfloor of this enormous building.\r\n\r\nThen the party went across the street to where they did the killing of\r\nbeef\xe2\x80\x94where every hour they turned four or five hundred cattle into\r\nmeat. Unlike the place they had left, all this work was done on one\r\nfloor; and instead of there being one line of carcasses which moved to\r\nthe workmen, there were fifteen or twenty lines, and the men moved from\r\none to another of these. This made a scene of intense activity, a\r\npicture of human power wonderful to watch. It was all in one great\r\nroom, like a circus amphitheater, with a gallery for visitors running\r\nover the center.\r\n\r\nAlong one side of the room ran a narrow gallery, a few feet from the\r\nfloor; into which gallery the cattle were driven by men with goads\r\nwhich gave them electric shocks. Once crowded in here, the creatures\r\nwere prisoned, each in a separate pen, by gates that shut, leaving them\r\nno room to turn around; and while they stood bellowing and plunging,\r\nover the top of the pen there leaned one of the \xe2\x80\x9cknockers,\xe2\x80\x9d armed with\r\na sledge hammer, and watching for a chance to deal a blow. The room\r\nechoed with the thuds in quick succession, and the stamping and kicking\r\nof the steers. The instant the animal had fallen, the \xe2\x80\x9cknocker\xe2\x80\x9d passed\r\non to another; while a second man raised a lever, and the side of the\r\npen was raised, and the animal, still kicking and struggling, slid out\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x9ckilling bed.\xe2\x80\x9d Here a man put shackles about one leg, and\r\npressed another lever, and the body was jerked up into the air. There\r\nwere fifteen or twenty such pens, and it was a matter of only a couple\r\nof minutes to knock fifteen or twenty cattle and roll them out. Then\r\nonce more the gates were opened, and another lot rushed in; and so out\r\nof each pen there rolled a steady stream of carcasses, which the men\r\nupon the killing beds had to get out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which they did this was something to be seen and never\r\nforgotten. They worked with furious intensity, literally upon the\r\nrun\xe2\x80\x94at a pace with which there is nothing to be compared except a\r\nfootball game. It was all highly specialized labor, each man having his\r\ntask to do; generally this would consist of only two or three specific\r\ncuts, and he would pass down the line of fifteen or twenty carcasses,\r\nmaking these cuts upon each. First there came the \xe2\x80\x9cbutcher,\xe2\x80\x9d to bleed\r\nthem; this meant one swift stroke, so swift that you could not see\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94only the flash of the knife; and before you could realize it, the\r\nman had darted on to the next line, and a stream of bright red was\r\npouring out upon the floor. This floor was half an inch deep with\r\nblood, in spite of the best efforts of men who kept shoveling it\r\nthrough holes; it must have made the floor slippery, but no one could\r\nhave guessed this by watching the men at work.\r\n\r\nThe carcass hung for a few minutes to bleed; there was no time lost,\r\nhowever, for there were several hanging in each line, and one was\r\nalways ready. It was let down to the ground, and there came the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cheadsman,\xe2\x80\x9d whose task it was to sever the head, with two or three\r\nswift strokes. Then came the \xe2\x80\x9cfloorsman,\xe2\x80\x9d to make the first cut in the\r\nskin; and then another to finish ripping the skin down the center; and\r\nthen half a dozen more in swift succession, to finish the skinning.\r\nAfter they were through, the carcass was again swung up; and while a\r\nman with a stick examined the skin, to make sure that it had not been\r\ncut, and another rolled it up and tumbled it through one of the\r\ninevitable holes in the floor, the beef proceeded on its journey. There\r\nwere men to cut it, and men to split it, and men to gut it and scrape\r\nit clean inside. There were some with hose which threw jets of boiling\r\nwater upon it, and others who removed the feet and added the final\r\ntouches. In the end, as with the hogs, the finished beef was run into\r\nthe chilling room, to hang its appointed time.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were taken there and shown them, all neatly hung in rows,\r\nlabeled conspicuously with the tags of the government inspectors\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsome, which had been killed by a special process, marked with the sign\r\nof the kosher rabbi, certifying that it was fit for sale to the\r\northodox. And then the visitors were taken to the other parts of the\r\nbuilding, to see what became of each particle of the waste material\r\nthat had vanished through the floor; and to the pickling rooms, and the\r\nsalting rooms, the canning rooms, and the packing rooms, where choice\r\nmeat was prepared for shipping in refrigerator cars, destined to be\r\neaten in all the four corners of civilization. Afterward they went\r\noutside, wandering about among the mazes of buildings in which was done\r\nthe work auxiliary to this great industry. There was scarcely a thing\r\nneeded in the business that Durham and Company did not make for\r\nthemselves. There was a great steam power plant and an electricity\r\nplant. There was a barrel factory, and a boiler-repair shop. There was\r\na building to which the grease was piped, and made into soap and lard;\r\nand then there was a factory for making lard cans, and another for\r\nmaking soap boxes. There was a building in which the bristles were\r\ncleaned and dried, for the making of hair cushions and such things;\r\nthere was a building where the skins were dried and tanned, there was\r\nanother where heads and feet were made into glue, and another where\r\nbones were made into fertilizer. No tiniest particle of organic matter\r\nwas wasted in Durham\xe2\x80\x99s. Out of the horns of the cattle they made combs,\r\nbuttons, hairpins, and imitation ivory; out of the shinbones and other\r\nbig bones they cut knife and toothbrush handles, and mouthpieces for\r\npipes; out of the hoofs they cut hairpins and buttons, before they made\r\nthe rest into glue. From such things as feet, knuckles, hide clippings,\r\nand sinews came such strange and unlikely products as gelatin,\r\nisinglass, and phosphorus, bone black, shoe blacking, and bone oil.\r\nThey had curled-hair works for the cattle tails, and a \xe2\x80\x9cwool pullery\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor the sheepskins; they made pepsin from the stomachs of the pigs, and\r\nalbumen from the blood, and violin strings from the ill-smelling\r\nentrails. When there was nothing else to be done with a thing, they\r\nfirst put it into a tank and got out of it all the tallow and grease,\r\nand then they made it into fertilizer. All these industries were\r\ngathered into buildings near by, connected by galleries and railroads\r\nwith the main establishment; and it was estimated that they had handled\r\nnearly a quarter of a billion of animals since the founding of the\r\nplant by the elder Durham a generation and more ago. If you counted\r\nwith it the other big plants\xe2\x80\x94and they were now really all one\xe2\x80\x94it was,\r\nso Jokubas informed them, the greatest aggregation of labor and capital\r\never gathered in one place. It employed thirty thousand men; it\r\nsupported directly two hundred and fifty thousand people in its\r\nneighborhood, and indirectly it supported half a million. It sent its\r\nproducts to every country in the civilized world, and it furnished the\r\nfood for no less than thirty million people!\r\n\r\nTo all of these things our friends would listen open-mouthed\xe2\x80\x94it seemed\r\nto them impossible of belief that anything so stupendous could have\r\nbeen devised by mortal man. That was why to Jurgis it seemed almost\r\nprofanity to speak about the place as did Jokubas, skeptically; it was\r\na thing as tremendous as the universe\xe2\x80\x94the laws and ways of its working\r\nno more than the universe to be questioned or understood. All that a\r\nmere man could do, it seemed to Jurgis, was to take a thing like this\r\nas he found it, and do as he was told; to be given a place in it and a\r\nshare in its wonderful activities was a blessing to be grateful for, as\r\none was grateful for the sunshine and the rain. Jurgis was even glad\r\nthat he had not seen the place before meeting with his triumph, for he\r\nfelt that the size of it would have overwhelmed him. But now he had\r\nbeen admitted\xe2\x80\x94he was a part of it all! He had the feeling that this\r\nwhole huge establishment had taken him under its protection, and had\r\nbecome responsible for his welfare. So guileless was he, and ignorant\r\nof the nature of business, that he did not even realize that he had\r\nbecome an employee of Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, and that Brown and Durham were supposed\r\nby all the world to be deadly rivals\xe2\x80\x94were even required to be deadly\r\nrivals by the law of the land, and ordered to try to ruin each other\r\nunder penalty of fine and imprisonment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nPromptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work. He came to\r\nthe door that had been pointed out to him, and there he waited for\r\nnearly two hours. The boss had meant for him to enter, but had not said\r\nthis, and so it was only when on his way out to hire another man that\r\nhe came upon Jurgis. He gave him a good cursing, but as Jurgis did not\r\nunderstand a word of it he did not object. He followed the boss, who\r\nshowed him where to put his street clothes, and waited while he donned\r\nthe working clothes he had bought in a secondhand shop and brought with\r\nhim in a bundle; then he led him to the \xe2\x80\x9ckilling beds.\xe2\x80\x9d The work which\r\nJurgis was to do here was very simple, and it took him but a few\r\nminutes to learn it. He was provided with a stiff besom, such as is\r\nused by street sweepers, and it was his place to follow down the line\r\nthe man who drew out the smoking entrails from the carcass of the\r\nsteer; this mass was to be swept into a trap, which was then closed, so\r\nthat no one might slip into it. As Jurgis came in, the first cattle of\r\nthe morning were just making their appearance; and so, with scarcely\r\ntime to look about him, and none to speak to any one, he fell to work.\r\nIt was a sweltering day in July, and the place ran with steaming hot\r\nblood\xe2\x80\x94one waded in it on the floor. The stench was almost overpowering,\r\nbut to Jurgis it was nothing. His whole soul was dancing with joy\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas at work at last! He was at work and earning money! All day long he\r\nwas figuring to himself. He was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and\r\na half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush day and he worked until\r\nnearly seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, he went home to the family with\r\nthe tidings that he had earned more than a dollar and a half in a\r\nsingle day!\r\n\r\nAt home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that\r\nthere was quite a celebration in Aniele\xe2\x80\x99s hall bedroom. Jonas had been\r\nto have an interview with the special policeman to whom Szedvilas had\r\nintroduced him, and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with\r\nthe result that one had promised him a job the beginning of the next\r\nweek. And then there was Marija Berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy\r\nby the success of Jurgis, had set out upon her own responsibility to\r\nget a place. Marija had nothing to take with her save her two brawny\r\narms and the word \xe2\x80\x9cjob,\xe2\x80\x9d laboriously learned; but with these she had\r\nmarched about Packingtown all day, entering every door where there were\r\nsigns of activity. Out of some she had been ordered with curses; but\r\nMarija was not afraid of man or devil, and asked every one she\r\nsaw\xe2\x80\x94visitors and strangers, or work-people like herself, and once or\r\ntwice even high and lofty office personages, who stared at her as if\r\nthey thought she was crazy. In the end, however, she had reaped her\r\nreward. In one of the smaller plants she had stumbled upon a room where\r\nscores of women and girls were sitting at long tables preparing smoked\r\nbeef in cans; and wandering through room after room, Marija came at\r\nlast to the place where the sealed cans were being painted and labeled,\r\nand here she had the good fortune to encounter the \xe2\x80\x9cforelady.\xe2\x80\x9d Marija\r\ndid not understand then, as she was destined to understand later, what\r\nthere was attractive to a \xe2\x80\x9cforelady\xe2\x80\x9d about the combination of a face\r\nfull of boundless good nature and the muscles of a dray horse; but the\r\nwoman had told her to come the next day and she would perhaps give her\r\na chance to learn the trade of painting cans. The painting of cans\r\nbeing skilled piecework, and paying as much as two dollars a day,\r\nMarija burst in upon the family with the yell of a Comanche Indian, and\r\nfell to capering about the room so as to frighten the baby almost into\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nBetter luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was\r\nonly one of them left to seek a place. Jurgis was determined that Teta\r\nElzbieta should stay at home to keep house, and that Ona should help\r\nher. He would not have Ona working\xe2\x80\x94he was not that sort of a man, he\r\nsaid, and she was not that sort of a woman. It would be a strange thing\r\nif a man like him could not support the family, with the help of the\r\nboard of Jonas and Marija. He would not even hear of letting the\r\nchildren go to work\xe2\x80\x94there were schools here in America for children,\r\nJurgis had heard, to which they could go for nothing. That the priest\r\nwould object to these schools was something of which he had as yet no\r\nidea, and for the present his mind was made up that the children of\r\nTeta Elzbieta should have as fair a chance as any other children. The\r\noldest of them, little Stanislovas, was but thirteen, and small for his\r\nage at that; and while the oldest son of Szedvilas was only twelve, and\r\nhad worked for over a year at Jones\xe2\x80\x99s, Jurgis would have it that\r\nStanislovas should learn to speak English, and grow up to be a skilled\r\nman.\r\n\r\nSo there was only old Dede Antanas; Jurgis would have had him rest too,\r\nbut he was forced to acknowledge that this was not possible, and,\r\nbesides, the old man would not hear it spoken of\xe2\x80\x94it was his whim to\r\ninsist that he was as lively as any boy. He had come to America as full\r\nof hope as the best of them; and now he was the chief problem that\r\nworried his son. For every one that Jurgis spoke to assured him that it\r\nwas a waste of time to seek employment for the old man in Packingtown.\r\nSzedvilas told him that the packers did not even keep the men who had\r\ngrown old in their own service\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of taking on new ones.\r\nAnd not only was it the rule here, it was the rule everywhere in\r\nAmerica, so far as he knew. To satisfy Jurgis he had asked the\r\npoliceman, and brought back the message that the thing was not to be\r\nthought of. They had not told this to old Anthony, who had consequently\r\nspent the two days wandering about from one part of the yards to\r\nanother, and had now come home to hear about the triumph of the others,\r\nsmiling bravely and saying that it would be his turn another day.\r\n\r\nTheir good luck, they felt, had given them the right to think about a\r\nhome; and sitting out on the doorstep that summer evening, they held\r\nconsultation about it, and Jurgis took occasion to broach a weighty\r\nsubject. Passing down the avenue to work that morning he had seen two\r\nboys leaving an advertisement from house to house; and seeing that\r\nthere were pictures upon it, Jurgis had asked for one, and had rolled\r\nit up and tucked it into his shirt. At noontime a man with whom he had\r\nbeen talking had read it to him and told him a little about it, with\r\nthe result that Jurgis had conceived a wild idea.\r\n\r\nHe brought out the placard, which was quite a work of art. It was\r\nnearly two feet long, printed on calendered paper, with a selection of\r\ncolors so bright that they shone even in the moonlight. The center of\r\nthe placard was occupied by a house, brilliantly painted, new, and\r\ndazzling. The roof of it was of a purple hue, and trimmed with gold;\r\nthe house itself was silvery, and the doors and windows red. It was a\r\ntwo-story building, with a porch in front, and a very fancy scrollwork\r\naround the edges; it was complete in every tiniest detail, even the\r\ndoorknob, and there was a hammock on the porch and white lace curtains\r\nin the windows. Underneath this, in one corner, was a picture of a\r\nhusband and wife in loving embrace; in the opposite corner was a\r\ncradle, with fluffy curtains drawn over it, and a smiling cherub\r\nhovering upon silver-colored wings. For fear that the significance of\r\nall this should be lost, there was a label, in Polish, Lithuanian, and\r\nGerman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Dom. Namai. Heim._\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy pay rent?\xe2\x80\x9d the linguistic circular\r\nwent on to demand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not own your own home? Do you know that you can\r\nbuy one for less than your rent? We have built thousands of homes which\r\nare now occupied by happy families.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94So it became eloquent, picturing\r\nthe blissfulness of married life in a house with nothing to pay. It\r\neven quoted \xe2\x80\x9cHome, Sweet Home,\xe2\x80\x9d and made bold to translate it into\r\nPolish\xe2\x80\x94though for some reason it omitted the Lithuanian of this.\r\nPerhaps the translator found it a difficult matter to be sentimental in\r\na language in which a sob is known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a\r\nnusiszypsojimas.\r\n\r\nOver this document the family pored long, while Ona spelled out its\r\ncontents. It appeared that this house contained four rooms, besides a\r\nbasement, and that it might be bought for fifteen hundred dollars, the\r\nlot and all. Of this, only three hundred dollars had to be paid down,\r\nthe balance being paid at the rate of twelve dollars a month. These\r\nwere frightful sums, but then they were in America, where people talked\r\nabout such without fear. They had learned that they would have to pay a\r\nrent of nine dollars a month for a flat, and there was no way of doing\r\nbetter, unless the family of twelve was to exist in one or two rooms,\r\nas at present. If they paid rent, of course, they might pay forever,\r\nand be no better off; whereas, if they could only meet the extra\r\nexpense in the beginning, there would at last come a time when they\r\nwould not have any rent to pay for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nThey figured it up. There was a little left of the money belonging to\r\nTeta Elzbieta, and there was a little left to Jurgis. Marija had about\r\nfifty dollars pinned up somewhere in her stockings, and Grandfather\r\nAnthony had part of the money he had gotten for his farm. If they all\r\ncombined, they would have enough to make the first payment; and if they\r\nhad employment, so that they could be sure of the future, it might\r\nreally prove the best plan. It was, of course, not a thing even to be\r\ntalked of lightly; it was a thing they would have to sift to the\r\nbottom. And yet, on the other hand, if they were going to make the\r\nventure, the sooner they did it the better, for were they not paying\r\nrent all the time, and living in a most horrible way besides? Jurgis\r\nwas used to dirt\xe2\x80\x94there was nothing could scare a man who had been with\r\na railroad gang, where one could gather up the fleas off the floor of\r\nthe sleeping room by the handful. But that sort of thing would not do\r\nfor Ona. They must have a better place of some sort soon\xe2\x80\x94Jurgis said it\r\nwith all the assurance of a man who had just made a dollar and\r\nfifty-seven cents in a single day. Jurgis was at a loss to understand\r\nwhy, with wages as they were, so many of the people of this district\r\nshould live the way they did.\r\n\r\nThe next day Marija went to see her \xe2\x80\x9cforelady,\xe2\x80\x9d and was told to report\r\nthe first of the week, and learn the business of can-painter. Marija\r\nwent home, singing out loud all the way, and was just in time to join\r\nOna and her stepmother as they were setting out to go and make inquiry\r\nconcerning the house. That evening the three made their report to the\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94the thing was altogether as represented in the circular, or at any\r\nrate so the agent had said. The houses lay to the south, about a mile\r\nand a half from the yards; they were wonderful bargains, the gentleman\r\nhad assured them\xe2\x80\x94personally, and for their own good. He could do this,\r\nso he explained to them, for the reason that he had himself no interest\r\nin their sale\xe2\x80\x94he was merely the agent for a company that had built\r\nthem. These were the last, and the company was going out of business,\r\nso if any one wished to take advantage of this wonderful no-rent plan,\r\nhe would have to be very quick. As a matter of fact there was just a\r\nlittle uncertainty as to whether there was a single house left; for the\r\nagent had taken so many people to see them, and for all he knew the\r\ncompany might have parted with the last. Seeing Teta Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s evident\r\ngrief at this news, he added, after some hesitation, that if they\r\nreally intended to make a purchase, he would send a telephone message\r\nat his own expense, and have one of the houses kept. So it had finally\r\nbeen arranged\xe2\x80\x94and they were to go and make an inspection the following\r\nSunday morning.\r\n\r\nThat was Thursday; and all the rest of the week the killing gang at\r\nBrown\xe2\x80\x99s worked at full pressure, and Jurgis cleared a dollar\r\nseventy-five every day. That was at the rate of ten and one-half\r\ndollars a week, or forty-five a month. Jurgis was not able to figure,\r\nexcept it was a very simple sum, but Ona was like lightning at such\r\nthings, and she worked out the problem for the family. Marija and Jonas\r\nwere each to pay sixteen dollars a month board, and the old man\r\ninsisted that he could do the same as soon as he got a place\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nmight be any day now. That would make ninety-three dollars. Then Marija\r\nand Jonas were between them to take a third share in the house, which\r\nwould leave only eight dollars a month for Jurgis to contribute to the\r\npayment. So they would have eighty-five dollars a month\xe2\x80\x94or, supposing\r\nthat Dede Antanas did not get work at once, seventy dollars a\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x94which ought surely to be sufficient for the support of a family\r\nof twelve.\r\n\r\nAn hour before the time on Sunday morning the entire party set out.\r\nThey had the address written on a piece of paper, which they showed to\r\nsome one now and then. It proved to be a long mile and a half, but they\r\nwalked it, and half an hour or so later the agent put in an appearance.\r\nHe was a smooth and florid personage, elegantly dressed, and he spoke\r\ntheir language freely, which gave him a great advantage in dealing with\r\nthem. He escorted them to the house, which was one of a long row of the\r\ntypical frame dwellings of the neighborhood, where architecture is a\r\nluxury that is dispensed with. Ona\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank, for the house was not\r\nas it was shown in the picture; the color scheme was different, for one\r\nthing, and then it did not seem quite so big. Still, it was freshly\r\npainted, and made a considerable show. It was all brand-new, so the\r\nagent told them, but he talked so incessantly that they were quite\r\nconfused, and did not have time to ask many questions. There were all\r\nsorts of things they had made up their minds to inquire about, but when\r\nthe time came, they either forgot them or lacked the courage. The other\r\nhouses in the row did not seem to be new, and few of them seemed to be\r\noccupied. When they ventured to hint at this, the agent\xe2\x80\x99s reply was\r\nthat the purchasers would be moving in shortly. To press the matter\r\nwould have seemed to be doubting his word, and never in their lives had\r\nany one of them ever spoken to a person of the class called \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexcept with deference and humility.\r\n\r\nThe house had a basement, about two feet below the street line, and a\r\nsingle story, about six feet above it, reached by a flight of steps. In\r\naddition there was an attic, made by the peak of the roof, and having\r\none small window in each end. The street in front of the house was\r\nunpaved and unlighted, and the view from it consisted of a few exactly\r\nsimilar houses, scattered here and there upon lots grown up with dingy\r\nbrown weeds. The house inside contained four rooms, plastered white;\r\nthe basement was but a frame, the walls being unplastered and the floor\r\nnot laid. The agent explained that the houses were built that way, as\r\nthe purchasers generally preferred to finish the basements to suit\r\ntheir own taste. The attic was also unfinished\xe2\x80\x94the family had been\r\nfiguring that in case of an emergency they could rent this attic, but\r\nthey found that there was not even a floor, nothing but joists, and\r\nbeneath them the lath and plaster of the ceiling below. All of this,\r\nhowever, did not chill their ardor as much as might have been expected,\r\nbecause of the volubility of the agent. There was no end to the\r\nadvantages of the house, as he set them forth, and he was not silent\r\nfor an instant; he showed them everything, down to the locks on the\r\ndoors and the catches on the windows, and how to work them. He showed\r\nthem the sink in the kitchen, with running water and a faucet,\r\nsomething which Teta Elzbieta had never in her wildest dreams hoped to\r\npossess. After a discovery such as that it would have seemed ungrateful\r\nto find any fault, and so they tried to shut their eyes to other\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\nStill, they were peasant people, and they hung on to their money by\r\ninstinct; it was quite in vain that the agent hinted at promptness\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwould see, they would see, they told him, they could not decide until\r\nthey had had more time. And so they went home again, and all day and\r\nevening there was figuring and debating. It was an agony to them to\r\nhave to make up their minds in a matter such as this. They never could\r\nagree all together; there were so many arguments upon each side, and\r\none would be obstinate, and no sooner would the rest have convinced him\r\nthan it would transpire that his arguments had caused another to waver.\r\nOnce, in the evening, when they were all in harmony, and the house was\r\nas good as bought, Szedvilas came in and upset them again. Szedvilas\r\nhad no use for property owning. He told them cruel stories of people\r\nwho had been done to death in this \xe2\x80\x9cbuying a home\xe2\x80\x9d swindle. They would\r\nbe almost sure to get into a tight place and lose all their money; and\r\nthere was no end of expense that one could never foresee; and the house\r\nmight be good-for-nothing from top to bottom\xe2\x80\x94how was a poor man to\r\nknow? Then, too, they would swindle you with the contract\xe2\x80\x94and how was a\r\npoor man to understand anything about a contract? It was all nothing\r\nbut robbery, and there was no safety but in keeping out of it. And pay\r\nrent? asked Jurgis. Ah, yes, to be sure, the other answered, that too\r\nwas robbery. It was all robbery, for a poor man. After half an hour of\r\nsuch depressing conversation, they had their minds quite made up that\r\nthey had been saved at the brink of a precipice; but then Szedvilas\r\nwent away, and Jonas, who was a sharp little man, reminded them that\r\nthe delicatessen business was a failure, according to its proprietor,\r\nand that this might account for his pessimistic views. Which, of\r\ncourse, reopened the subject!\r\n\r\nThe controlling factor was that they could not stay where they\r\nwere\xe2\x80\x94they had to go somewhere. And when they gave up the house plan and\r\ndecided to rent, the prospect of paying out nine dollars a month\r\nforever they found just as hard to face. All day and all night for\r\nnearly a whole week they wrestled with the problem, and then in the end\r\nJurgis took the responsibility. Brother Jonas had gotten his job, and\r\nwas pushing a truck in Durham\xe2\x80\x99s; and the killing gang at Brown\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontinued to work early and late, so that Jurgis grew more confident\r\nevery hour, more certain of his mastership. It was the kind of thing\r\nthe man of the family had to decide and carry through, he told himself.\r\nOthers might have failed at it, but he was not the failing kind\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwould show them how to do it. He would work all day, and all night,\r\ntoo, if need be; he would never rest until the house was paid for and\r\nhis people had a home. So he told them, and so in the end the decision\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nThey had talked about looking at more houses before they made the\r\npurchase; but then they did not know where any more were, and they did\r\nnot know any way of finding out. The one they had seen held the sway in\r\ntheir thoughts; whenever they thought of themselves in a house, it was\r\nthis house that they thought of. And so they went and told the agent\r\nthat they were ready to make the agreement. They knew, as an abstract\r\nproposition, that in matters of business all men are to be accounted\r\nliars; but they could not but have been influenced by all they had\r\nheard from the eloquent agent, and were quite persuaded that the house\r\nwas something they had run a risk of losing by their delay. They drew a\r\ndeep breath when he told them that they were still in time.\r\n\r\nThey were to come on the morrow, and he would have the papers all drawn\r\nup. This matter of papers was one in which Jurgis understood to the\r\nfull the need of caution; yet he could not go himself\xe2\x80\x94every one told\r\nhim that he could not get a holiday, and that he might lose his job by\r\nasking. So there was nothing to be done but to trust it to the women,\r\nwith Szedvilas, who promised to go with them. Jurgis spent a whole\r\nevening impressing upon them the seriousness of the occasion\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nfinally, out of innumerable hiding places about their persons and in\r\ntheir baggage, came forth the precious wads of money, to be done up\r\ntightly in a little bag and sewed fast in the lining of Teta Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning they sallied forth. Jurgis had given them so many\r\ninstructions and warned them against so many perils, that the women\r\nwere quite pale with fright, and even the imperturbable delicatessen\r\nvender, who prided himself upon being a businessman, was ill at ease.\r\nThe agent had the deed all ready, and invited them to sit down and read\r\nit; this Szedvilas proceeded to do\xe2\x80\x94a painful and laborious process,\r\nduring which the agent drummed upon the desk. Teta Elzbieta was so\r\nembarrassed that the perspiration came out upon her forehead in beads;\r\nfor was not this reading as much as to say plainly to the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface that they doubted his honesty? Yet Jokubas Szedvilas read on and\r\non; and presently there developed that he had good reason for doing so.\r\nFor a horrible suspicion had begun dawning in his mind; he knitted his\r\nbrows more and more as he read. This was not a deed of sale at all, so\r\nfar as he could see\xe2\x80\x94it provided only for the renting of the property!\r\nIt was hard to tell, with all this strange legal jargon, words he had\r\nnever heard before; but was not this plain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe party of the first part\r\nhereby covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second\r\npart!\xe2\x80\x9d And then again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca monthly _rental_ of twelve dollars, for a\r\nperiod of eight years and four months!\xe2\x80\x9d Then Szedvilas took off his\r\nspectacles, and looked at the agent, and stammered a question.\r\n\r\nThe agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual\r\nformula; that it was always arranged that the property should be merely\r\nrented. He kept trying to show them something in the next paragraph;\r\nbut Szedvilas could not get by the word \xe2\x80\x9crental\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and when he translated\r\nit to Teta Elzbieta, she too was thrown into a fright. They would not\r\nown the home at all, then, for nearly nine years! The agent, with\r\ninfinite patience, began to explain again; but no explanation would do\r\nnow. Elzbieta had firmly fixed in her mind the last solemn warning of\r\nJurgis: \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is anything wrong, do not give him the money, but go\r\nout and get a lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d It was an agonizing moment, but she sat in the\r\nchair, her hands clenched like death, and made a fearful effort,\r\nsummoning all her powers, and gasped out her purpose.\r\n\r\nJokubas translated her words. She expected the agent to fly into a\r\npassion, but he was, to her bewilderment, as ever imperturbable; he\r\neven offered to go and get a lawyer for her, but she declined this.\r\nThey went a long way, on purpose to find a man who would not be a\r\nconfederate. Then let any one imagine their dismay, when, after half an\r\nhour, they came in with a lawyer, and heard him greet the agent by his\r\nfirst name! They felt that all was lost; they sat like prisoners\r\nsummoned to hear the reading of their death warrant. There was nothing\r\nmore that they could do\xe2\x80\x94they were trapped! The lawyer read over the\r\ndeed, and when he had read it he informed Szedvilas that it was all\r\nperfectly regular, that the deed was a blank deed such as was often\r\nused in these sales. And was the price as agreed? the old man\r\nasked\xe2\x80\x94three hundred dollars down, and the balance at twelve dollars a\r\nmonth, till the total of fifteen hundred dollars had been paid? Yes,\r\nthat was correct. And it was for the sale of such and such a house\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nhouse and lot and everything? Yes,\xe2\x80\x94and the lawyer showed him where that\r\nwas all written. And it was all perfectly regular\xe2\x80\x94there were no tricks\r\nabout it of any sort? They were poor people, and this was all they had\r\nin the world, and if there was anything wrong they would be ruined. And\r\nso Szedvilas went on, asking one trembling question after another,\r\nwhile the eyes of the women folks were fixed upon him in mute agony.\r\nThey could not understand what he was saying, but they knew that upon\r\nit their fate depended. And when at last he had questioned until there\r\nwas no more questioning to be done, and the time came for them to make\r\nup their minds, and either close the bargain or reject it, it was all\r\nthat poor Teta Elzbieta could do to keep from bursting into tears.\r\nJokubas had asked her if she wished to sign; he had asked her twice\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhat could she say? How did she know if this lawyer were telling the\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94that he was not in the conspiracy? And yet, how could she say\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94what excuse could she give? The eyes of every one in the room were\r\nupon her, awaiting her decision; and at last, half blind with her\r\ntears, she began fumbling in her jacket, where she had pinned the\r\nprecious money. And she brought it out and unwrapped it before the men.\r\nAll of this Ona sat watching, from a corner of the room, twisting her\r\nhands together, meantime, in a fever of fright. Ona longed to cry out\r\nand tell her stepmother to stop, that it was all a trap; but there\r\nseemed to be something clutching her by the throat, and she could not\r\nmake a sound. And so Teta Elzbieta laid the money on the table, and the\r\nagent picked it up and counted it, and then wrote them a receipt for it\r\nand passed them the deed. Then he gave a sigh of satisfaction, and rose\r\nand shook hands with them all, still as smooth and polite as at the\r\nbeginning. Ona had a dim recollection of the lawyer telling Szedvilas\r\nthat his charge was a dollar, which occasioned some debate, and more\r\nagony; and then, after they had paid that, too, they went out into the\r\nstreet, her stepmother clutching the deed in her hand. They were so\r\nweak from fright that they could not walk, but had to sit down on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSo they went home, with a deadly terror gnawing at their souls; and\r\nthat evening Jurgis came home and heard their story, and that was the\r\nend. Jurgis was sure that they had been swindled, and were ruined; and\r\nhe tore his hair and cursed like a madman, swearing that he would kill\r\nthe agent that very night. In the end he seized the paper and rushed\r\nout of the house, and all the way across the yards to Halsted Street.\r\nHe dragged Szedvilas out from his supper, and together they rushed to\r\nconsult another lawyer. When they entered his office the lawyer sprang\r\nup, for Jurgis looked like a crazy person, with flying hair and\r\nbloodshot eyes. His companion explained the situation, and the lawyer\r\ntook the paper and began to read it, while Jurgis stood clutching the\r\ndesk with knotted hands, trembling in every nerve.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the lawyer looked up and asked a question of Szedvilas;\r\nthe other did not know a word that he was saying, but his eyes were\r\nfixed upon the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s face, striving in an agony of dread to read his\r\nmind. He saw the lawyer look up and laugh, and he gave a gasp; the man\r\nsaid something to Szedvilas, and Jurgis turned upon his friend, his\r\nheart almost stopping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he panted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says it is all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Szedvilas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he says it is just as it should be.\xe2\x80\x9d And Jurgis, in his relief,\r\nsank down into a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped, and made Szedvilas translate question\r\nafter question. He could not hear it often enough; he could not ask\r\nwith enough variations. Yes, they had bought the house, they had really\r\nbought it. It belonged to them, they had only to pay the money and it\r\nwould be all right. Then Jurgis covered his face with his hands, for\r\nthere were tears in his eyes, and he felt like a fool. But he had had\r\nsuch a horrible fright; strong man as he was, it left him almost too\r\nweak to stand up.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer explained that the rental was a form\xe2\x80\x94the property was said\r\nto be merely rented until the last payment had been made, the purpose\r\nbeing to make it easier to turn the party out if he did not make the\r\npayments. So long as they paid, however, they had nothing to fear, the\r\nhouse was all theirs.\r\n\r\nJurgis was so grateful that he paid the half dollar the lawyer asked\r\nwithout winking an eyelash, and then rushed home to tell the news to\r\nthe family. He found Ona in a faint and the babies screaming, and the\r\nwhole house in an uproar\xe2\x80\x94for it had been believed by all that he had\r\ngone to murder the agent. It was hours before the excitement could be\r\ncalmed; and all through that cruel night Jurgis would wake up now and\r\nthen and hear Ona and her stepmother in the next room, sobbing softly\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had bought their home. It was hard for them to realize that the\r\nwonderful house was theirs to move into whenever they chose. They spent\r\nall their time thinking about it, and what they were going to put into\r\nit. As their week with Aniele was up in three days, they lost no time\r\nin getting ready. They had to make some shift to furnish it, and every\r\ninstant of their leisure was given to discussing this.\r\n\r\nA person who had such a task before him would not need to look very far\r\nin Packingtown\xe2\x80\x94he had only to walk up the avenue and read the signs, or\r\nget into a streetcar, to obtain full information as to pretty much\r\neverything a human creature could need. It was quite touching, the zeal\r\nof people to see that his health and happiness were provided for. Did\r\nthe person wish to smoke? There was a little discourse about cigars,\r\nshowing him exactly why the Thomas Jefferson Five-cent Perfecto was the\r\nonly cigar worthy of the name. Had he, on the other hand, smoked too\r\nmuch? Here was a remedy for the smoking habit, twenty-five doses for a\r\nquarter, and a cure absolutely guaranteed in ten doses. In innumerable\r\nways such as this, the traveler found that somebody had been busied to\r\nmake smooth his paths through the world, and to let him know what had\r\nbeen done for him. In Packingtown the advertisements had a style all of\r\ntheir own, adapted to the peculiar population. One would be tenderly\r\nsolicitous. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your wife pale?\xe2\x80\x9d it would inquire. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she discouraged,\r\ndoes she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?\r\nWhy do you not tell her to try Dr. Lanahan\xe2\x80\x99s Life Preservers?\xe2\x80\x9d Another\r\nwould be jocular in tone, slapping you on the back, so to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe a chump!\xe2\x80\x9d it would exclaim. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and get the Goliath Bunion Cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet a move on you!\xe2\x80\x9d would chime in another. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy, if you wear\r\nthe Eureka Two-fifty Shoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong these importunate signs was one that had caught the attention of\r\nthe family by its pictures. It showed two very pretty little birds\r\nbuilding themselves a home; and Marija had asked an acquaintance to\r\nread it to her, and told them that it related to the furnishing of a\r\nhouse. \xe2\x80\x9cFeather your nest,\xe2\x80\x9d it ran\xe2\x80\x94and went on to say that it could\r\nfurnish all the necessary feathers for a four-room nest for the\r\nludicrously small sum of seventy-five dollars. The particularly\r\nimportant thing about this offer was that only a small part of the\r\nmoney need be had at once\xe2\x80\x94the rest one might pay a few dollars every\r\nmonth. Our friends had to have some furniture, there was no getting\r\naway from that; but their little fund of money had sunk so low that\r\nthey could hardly get to sleep at night, and so they fled to this as\r\ntheir deliverance. There was more agony and another paper for Elzbieta\r\nto sign, and then one night when Jurgis came home, he was told the\r\nbreathless tidings that the furniture had arrived and was safely stowed\r\nin the house: a parlor set of four pieces, a bedroom set of three\r\npieces, a dining room table and four chairs, a toilet set with\r\nbeautiful pink roses painted all over it, an assortment of crockery,\r\nalso with pink roses\xe2\x80\x94and so on. One of the plates in the set had been\r\nfound broken when they unpacked it, and Ona was going to the store the\r\nfirst thing in the morning to make them change it; also they had\r\npromised three saucepans, and there had only two come, and did Jurgis\r\nthink that they were trying to cheat them?\r\n\r\nThe next day they went to the house; and when the men came from work\r\nthey ate a few hurried mouthfuls at Aniele\xe2\x80\x99s, and then set to work at\r\nthe task of carrying their belongings to their new home. The distance\r\nwas in reality over two miles, but Jurgis made two trips that night,\r\neach time with a huge pile of mattresses and bedding on his head, with\r\nbundles of clothing and bags and things tied up inside. Anywhere else\r\nin Chicago he would have stood a good chance of being arrested; but the\r\npolicemen in Packingtown were apparently used to these informal\r\nmovings, and contented themselves with a cursory examination now and\r\nthen. It was quite wonderful to see how fine the house looked, with all\r\nthe things in it, even by the dim light of a lamp: it was really home,\r\nand almost as exciting as the placard had described it. Ona was fairly\r\ndancing, and she and Cousin Marija took Jurgis by the arm and escorted\r\nhim from room to room, sitting in each chair by turns, and then\r\ninsisting that he should do the same. One chair squeaked with his great\r\nweight, and they screamed with fright, and woke the baby and brought\r\neverybody running. Altogether it was a great day; and tired as they\r\nwere, Jurgis and Ona sat up late, contented simply to hold each other\r\nand gaze in rapture about the room. They were going to be married as\r\nsoon as they could get everything settled, and a little spare money put\r\nby; and this was to be their home\xe2\x80\x94that little room yonder would be\r\ntheirs!\r\n\r\nIt was in truth a never-ending delight, the fixing up of this house.\r\nThey had no money to spend for the pleasure of spending, but there were\r\na few absolutely necessary things, and the buying of these was a\r\nperpetual adventure for Ona. It must always be done at night, so that\r\nJurgis could go along; and even if it were only a pepper cruet, or half\r\na dozen glasses for ten cents, that was enough for an expedition. On\r\nSaturday night they came home with a great basketful of things, and\r\nspread them out on the table, while every one stood round, and the\r\nchildren climbed up on the chairs, or howled to be lifted up to see.\r\nThere were sugar and salt and tea and crackers, and a can of lard and a\r\nmilk pail, and a scrubbing brush, and a pair of shoes for the second\r\noldest boy, and a can of oil, and a tack hammer, and a pound of nails.\r\nThese last were to be driven into the walls of the kitchen and the\r\nbedrooms, to hang things on; and there was a family discussion as to\r\nthe place where each one was to be driven. Then Jurgis would try to\r\nhammer, and hit his fingers because the hammer was too small, and get\r\nmad because Ona had refused to let him pay fifteen cents more and get a\r\nbigger hammer; and Ona would be invited to try it herself, and hurt her\r\nthumb, and cry out, which necessitated the thumb\xe2\x80\x99s being kissed by\r\nJurgis. Finally, after every one had had a try, the nails would be\r\ndriven, and something hung up. Jurgis had come home with a big packing\r\nbox on his head, and he sent Jonas to get another that he had bought.\r\nHe meant to take one side out of these tomorrow, and put shelves in\r\nthem, and make them into bureaus and places to keep things for the\r\nbedrooms. The nest which had been advertised had not included feathers\r\nfor quite so many birds as there were in this family.\r\n\r\nThey had, of course, put their dining table in the kitchen, and the\r\ndining room was used as the bedroom of Teta Elzbieta and five of her\r\nchildren. She and the two youngest slept in the only bed, and the other\r\nthree had a mattress on the floor. Ona and her cousin dragged a\r\nmattress into the parlor and slept at night, and the three men and the\r\noldest boy slept in the other room, having nothing but the very level\r\nfloor to rest on for the present. Even so, however, they slept\r\nsoundly\xe2\x80\x94it was necessary for Teta Elzbieta to pound more than once on\r\nthe door at a quarter past five every morning. She would have ready a\r\ngreat pot full of steaming black coffee, and oatmeal and bread and\r\nsmoked sausages; and then she would fix them their dinner pails with\r\nmore thick slices of bread with lard between them\xe2\x80\x94they could not afford\r\nbutter\xe2\x80\x94and some onions and a piece of cheese, and so they would tramp\r\naway to work.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time in his life that he had ever really worked, it\r\nseemed to Jurgis; it was the first time that he had ever had anything\r\nto do which took all he had in him. Jurgis had stood with the rest up\r\nin the gallery and watched the men on the killing beds, marveling at\r\ntheir speed and power as if they had been wonderful machines; it\r\nsomehow never occurred to one to think of the flesh-and-blood side of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that is, not until he actually got down into the pit and took off\r\nhis coat. Then he saw things in a different light, he got at the inside\r\nof them. The pace they set here, it was one that called for every\r\nfaculty of a man\xe2\x80\x94from the instant the first steer fell till the\r\nsounding of the noon whistle, and again from half-past twelve till\r\nheaven only knew what hour in the late afternoon or evening, there was\r\nnever one instant\xe2\x80\x99s rest for a man, for his hand or his eye or his\r\nbrain. Jurgis saw how they managed it; there were portions of the work\r\nwhich determined the pace of the rest, and for these they had picked\r\nmen whom they paid high wages, and whom they changed frequently. You\r\nmight easily pick out these pacemakers, for they worked under the eye\r\nof the bosses, and they worked like men possessed. This was called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspeeding up the gang,\xe2\x80\x9d and if any man could not keep up with the pace,\r\nthere were hundreds outside begging to try.\r\n\r\nYet Jurgis did not mind it; he rather enjoyed it. It saved him the\r\nnecessity of flinging his arms about and fidgeting as he did in most\r\nwork. He would laugh to himself as he ran down the line, darting a\r\nglance now and then at the man ahead of him. It was not the pleasantest\r\nwork one could think of, but it was necessary work; and what more had a\r\nman the right to ask than a chance to do something useful, and to get\r\ngood pay for doing it?\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis thought, and so he spoke, in his bold, free way; very much to\r\nhis surprise, he found that it had a tendency to get him into trouble.\r\nFor most of the men here took a fearfully different view of the thing.\r\nHe was quite dismayed when he first began to find it out\xe2\x80\x94that most of\r\nthe men _hated_ their work. It seemed strange, it was even terrible,\r\nwhen you came to find out the universality of the sentiment; but it was\r\ncertainly the fact\xe2\x80\x94they hated their work. They hated the bosses and\r\nthey hated the owners; they hated the whole place, the whole\r\nneighborhood\xe2\x80\x94even the whole city, with an all-inclusive hatred, bitter\r\nand fierce. Women and little children would fall to cursing about it;\r\nit was rotten, rotten as hell\xe2\x80\x94everything was rotten. When Jurgis would\r\nask them what they meant, they would begin to get suspicious, and\r\ncontent themselves with saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, you stay here and see for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the first problems that Jurgis ran upon was that of the unions.\r\nHe had had no experience with unions, and he had to have it explained\r\nto him that the men were banded together for the purpose of fighting\r\nfor their rights. Jurgis asked them what they meant by their rights, a\r\nquestion in which he was quite sincere, for he had not any idea of any\r\nrights that he had, except the right to hunt for a job, and do as he\r\nwas told when he got it. Generally, however, this harmless question\r\nwould only make his fellow workingmen lose their tempers and call him a\r\nfool. There was a delegate of the butcher-helpers\xe2\x80\x99 union who came to\r\nsee Jurgis to enroll him; and when Jurgis found that this meant that he\r\nwould have to part with some of his money, he froze up directly, and\r\nthe delegate, who was an Irishman and only knew a few words of\r\nLithuanian, lost his temper and began to threaten him. In the end\r\nJurgis got into a fine rage, and made it sufficiently plain that it\r\nwould take more than one Irishman to scare him into a union. Little by\r\nlittle he gathered that the main thing the men wanted was to put a stop\r\nto the habit of \xe2\x80\x9cspeeding-up\xe2\x80\x9d; they were trying their best to force a\r\nlessening of the pace, for there were some, they said, who could not\r\nkeep up with it, whom it was killing. But Jurgis had no sympathy with\r\nsuch ideas as this\xe2\x80\x94he could do the work himself, and so could the rest\r\nof them, he declared, if they were good for anything. If they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo it, let them go somewhere else. Jurgis had not studied the books,\r\nand he would not have known how to pronounce \xe2\x80\x9claissez faire\xe2\x80\x9d; but he\r\nhad been round the world enough to know that a man has to shift for\r\nhimself in it, and that if he gets the worst of it, there is nobody to\r\nlisten to him holler.\r\n\r\nYet there have been known to be philosophers and plain men who swore by\r\nMalthus in the books, and would, nevertheless, subscribe to a relief\r\nfund in time of a famine. It was the same with Jurgis, who consigned\r\nthe unfit to destruction, while going about all day sick at heart\r\nbecause of his poor old father, who was wandering somewhere in the\r\nyards begging for a chance to earn his bread. Old Antanas had been a\r\nworker ever since he was a child; he had run away from home when he was\r\ntwelve, because his father beat him for trying to learn to read. And he\r\nwas a faithful man, too; he was a man you might leave alone for a\r\nmonth, if only you had made him understand what you wanted him to do in\r\nthe meantime. And now here he was, worn out in soul and body, and with\r\nno more place in the world than a sick dog. He had his home, as it\r\nhappened, and some one who would care for him if he never got a job;\r\nbut his son could not help thinking, suppose this had not been the\r\ncase. Antanas Rudkus had been into every building in Packingtown by\r\nthis time, and into nearly every room; he had stood mornings among the\r\ncrowd of applicants till the very policemen had come to know his face\r\nand to tell him to go home and give it up. He had been likewise to all\r\nthe stores and saloons for a mile about, begging for some little thing\r\nto do; and everywhere they had ordered him out, sometimes with curses,\r\nand not once even stopping to ask him a question.\r\n\r\nSo, after all, there was a crack in the fine structure of Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 faith\r\nin things as they are. The crack was wide while Dede Antanas was\r\nhunting a job\xe2\x80\x94and it was yet wider when he finally got it. For one\r\nevening the old man came home in a great state of excitement, with the\r\ntale that he had been approached by a man in one of the corridors of\r\nthe pickle rooms of Durham\xe2\x80\x99s, and asked what he would pay to get a job.\r\nHe had not known what to make of this at first; but the man had gone on\r\nwith matter-of-fact frankness to say that he could get him a job,\r\nprovided that he were willing to pay one-third of his wages for it. Was\r\nhe a boss? Antanas had asked; to which the man had replied that that\r\nwas nobody\xe2\x80\x99s business, but that he could do what he said.\r\n\r\nJurgis had made some friends by this time, and he sought one of them\r\nand asked what this meant. The friend, who was named Tamoszius\r\nKuszleika, was a sharp little man who folded hides on the killing beds,\r\nand he listened to what Jurgis had to say without seeming at all\r\nsurprised. They were common enough, he said, such cases of petty graft.\r\nIt was simply some boss who proposed to add a little to his income.\r\nAfter Jurgis had been there awhile he would know that the plants were\r\nsimply honeycombed with rottenness of that sort\xe2\x80\x94the bosses grafted off\r\nthe men, and they grafted off each other; and some day the\r\nsuperintendent would find out about the boss, and then he would graft\r\noff the boss. Warming to the subject, Tamoszius went on to explain the\r\nsituation. Here was Durham\xe2\x80\x99s, for instance, owned by a man who was\r\ntrying to make as much money out of it as he could, and did not care in\r\nthe least how he did it; and underneath him, ranged in ranks and grades\r\nlike an army, were managers and superintendents and foremen, each one\r\ndriving the man next below him and trying to squeeze out of him as much\r\nwork as possible. And all the men of the same rank were pitted against\r\neach other; the accounts of each were kept separately, and every man\r\nlived in terror of losing his job, if another made a better record than\r\nhe. So from top to bottom the place was simply a seething caldron of\r\njealousies and hatreds; there was no loyalty or decency anywhere about\r\nit, there was no place in it where a man counted for anything against a\r\ndollar. And worse than there being no decency, there was not even any\r\nhonesty. The reason for that? Who could say? It must have been old\r\nDurham in the beginning; it was a heritage which the self-made merchant\r\nhad left to his son, along with his millions.\r\n\r\nJurgis would find out these things for himself, if he stayed there long\r\nenough; it was the men who had to do all the dirty jobs, and so there\r\nwas no deceiving them; and they caught the spirit of the place, and did\r\nlike all the rest. Jurgis had come there, and thought he was going to\r\nmake himself useful, and rise and become a skilled man; but he would\r\nsoon find out his error\xe2\x80\x94for nobody rose in Packingtown by doing good\r\nwork. You could lay that down for a rule\xe2\x80\x94if you met a man who was\r\nrising in Packingtown, you met a knave. That man who had been sent to\r\nJurgis\xe2\x80\x99 father by the boss, _he_ would rise; the man who told tales and\r\nspied upon his fellows would rise; but the man who minded his own\r\nbusiness and did his work\xe2\x80\x94why, they would \xe2\x80\x9cspeed him up\xe2\x80\x9d till they had\r\nworn him out, and then they would throw him into the gutter.\r\n\r\nJurgis went home with his head buzzing. Yet he could not bring himself\r\nto believe such things\xe2\x80\x94no, it could not be so. Tamoszius was simply\r\nanother of the grumblers. He was a man who spent all his time fiddling;\r\nand he would go to parties at night and not get home till sunrise, and\r\nso of course he did not feel like work. Then, too, he was a puny little\r\nchap; and so he had been left behind in the race, and that was why he\r\nwas sore. And yet so many strange things kept coming to Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 notice\r\nevery day!\r\n\r\nHe tried to persuade his father to have nothing to do with the offer.\r\nBut old Antanas had begged until he was worn out, and all his courage\r\nwas gone; he wanted a job, any sort of a job. So the next day he went\r\nand found the man who had spoken to him, and promised to bring him a\r\nthird of all he earned; and that same day he was put to work in\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s cellars. It was a \xe2\x80\x9cpickle room,\xe2\x80\x9d where there was never a dry\r\nspot to stand upon, and so he had to take nearly the whole of his first\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s earnings to buy him a pair of heavy-soled boots. He was a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csqueedgie\xe2\x80\x9d man; his job was to go about all day with a long-handled\r\nmop, swabbing up the floor. Except that it was damp and dark, it was\r\nnot an unpleasant job, in summer.\r\n\r\nNow Antanas Rudkus was the meekest man that God ever put on earth; and\r\nso Jurgis found it a striking confirmation of what the men all said,\r\nthat his father had been at work only two days before he came home as\r\nbitter as any of them, and cursing Durham\xe2\x80\x99s with all the power of his\r\nsoul. For they had set him to cleaning out the traps; and the family\r\nsat round and listened in wonder while he told them what that meant. It\r\nseemed that he was working in the room where the men prepared the beef\r\nfor canning, and the beef had lain in vats full of chemicals, and men\r\nwith great forks speared it out and dumped it into trucks, to be taken\r\nto the cooking room. When they had speared out all they could reach,\r\nthey emptied the vat on the floor, and then with shovels scraped up the\r\nbalance and dumped it into the truck. This floor was filthy, yet they\r\nset Antanas with his mop slopping the \xe2\x80\x9cpickle\xe2\x80\x9d into a hole that\r\nconnected with a sink, where it was caught and used over again forever;\r\nand if that were not enough, there was a trap in the pipe, where all\r\nthe scraps of meat and odds and ends of refuse were caught, and every\r\nfew days it was the old man\xe2\x80\x99s task to clean these out, and shovel their\r\ncontents into one of the trucks with the rest of the meat!\r\n\r\nThis was the experience of Antanas; and then there came also Jonas and\r\nMarija with tales to tell. Marija was working for one of the\r\nindependent packers, and was quite beside herself and outrageous with\r\ntriumph over the sums of money she was making as a painter of cans. But\r\none day she walked home with a pale-faced little woman who worked\r\nopposite to her, Jadvyga Marcinkus by name, and Jadvyga told her how\r\nshe, Marija, had chanced to get her job. She had taken the place of an\r\nIrishwoman who had been working in that factory ever since any one\r\ncould remember. For over fifteen years, so she declared. Mary Dennis\r\nwas her name, and a long time ago she had been seduced, and had a\r\nlittle boy; he was a cripple, and an epileptic, but still he was all\r\nthat she had in the world to love, and they had lived in a little room\r\nalone somewhere back of Halsted Street, where the Irish were. Mary had\r\nhad consumption, and all day long you might hear her coughing as she\r\nworked; of late she had been going all to pieces, and when Marija came,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cforelady\xe2\x80\x9d had suddenly decided to turn her off. The forelady had\r\nto come up to a certain standard herself, and could not stop for sick\r\npeople, Jadvyga explained. The fact that Mary had been there so long\r\nhad not made any difference to her\xe2\x80\x94it was doubtful if she even knew\r\nthat, for both the forelady and the superintendent were new people,\r\nhaving only been there two or three years themselves. Jadvyga did not\r\nknow what had become of the poor creature; she would have gone to see\r\nher, but had been sick herself. She had pains in her back all the time,\r\nJadvyga explained, and feared that she had womb trouble. It was not fit\r\nwork for a woman, handling fourteen-pound cans all day.\r\n\r\nIt was a striking circumstance that Jonas, too, had gotten his job by\r\nthe misfortune of some other person. Jonas pushed a truck loaded with\r\nhams from the smoke rooms on to an elevator, and thence to the packing\r\nrooms. The trucks were all of iron, and heavy, and they put about\r\nthreescore hams on each of them, a load of more than a quarter of a\r\nton. On the uneven floor it was a task for a man to start one of these\r\ntrucks, unless he was a giant; and when it was once started he\r\nnaturally tried his best to keep it going. There was always the boss\r\nprowling about, and if there was a second\xe2\x80\x99s delay he would fall to\r\ncursing; Lithuanians and Slovaks and such, who could not understand\r\nwhat was said to them, the bosses were wont to kick about the place\r\nlike so many dogs. Therefore these trucks went for the most part on the\r\nrun; and the predecessor of Jonas had been jammed against the wall by\r\none and crushed in a horrible and nameless manner.\r\n\r\nAll of these were sinister incidents; but they were trifles compared to\r\nwhat Jurgis saw with his own eyes before long. One curious thing he had\r\nnoticed, the very first day, in his profession of shoveler of guts;\r\nwhich was the sharp trick of the floor bosses whenever there chanced to\r\ncome a \xe2\x80\x9cslunk\xe2\x80\x9d calf. Any man who knows anything about butchering knows\r\nthat the flesh of a cow that is about to calve, or has just calved, is\r\nnot fit for food. A good many of these came every day to the packing\r\nhouses\xe2\x80\x94and, of course, if they had chosen, it would have been an easy\r\nmatter for the packers to keep them till they were fit for food. But\r\nfor the saving of time and fodder, it was the law that cows of that\r\nsort came along with the others, and whoever noticed it would tell the\r\nboss, and the boss would start up a conversation with the government\r\ninspector, and the two would stroll away. So in a trice the carcass of\r\nthe cow would be cleaned out, and entrails would have vanished; it was\r\nJurgis\xe2\x80\x99 task to slide them into the trap, calves and all, and on the\r\nfloor below they took out these \xe2\x80\x9cslunk\xe2\x80\x9d calves, and butchered them for\r\nmeat, and used even the skins of them.\r\n\r\nOne day a man slipped and hurt his leg; and that afternoon, when the\r\nlast of the cattle had been disposed of, and the men were leaving,\r\nJurgis was ordered to remain and do some special work which this\r\ninjured man had usually done. It was late, almost dark, and the\r\ngovernment inspectors had all gone, and there were only a dozen or two\r\nof men on the floor. That day they had killed about four thousand\r\ncattle, and these cattle had come in freight trains from far states,\r\nand some of them had got hurt. There were some with broken legs, and\r\nsome with gored sides; there were some that had died, from what cause\r\nno one could say; and they were all to be disposed of, here in darkness\r\nand silence. \xe2\x80\x9cDowners,\xe2\x80\x9d the men called them; and the packing house had\r\na special elevator upon which they were raised to the killing beds,\r\nwhere the gang proceeded to handle them, with an air of businesslike\r\nnonchalance which said plainer than any words that it was a matter of\r\neveryday routine. It took a couple of hours to get them out of the way,\r\nand in the end Jurgis saw them go into the chilling rooms with the rest\r\nof the meat, being carefully scattered here and there so that they\r\ncould not be identified. When he came home that night he was in a very\r\nsomber mood, having begun to see at last how those might be right who\r\nhad laughed at him for his faith in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis and Ona were very much in love; they had waited a long time\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas now well into the second year, and Jurgis judged everything by the\r\ncriterion of its helping or hindering their union. All his thoughts\r\nwere there; he accepted the family because it was a part of Ona. And he\r\nwas interested in the house because it was to be Ona\xe2\x80\x99s home. Even the\r\ntricks and cruelties he saw at Durham\xe2\x80\x99s had little meaning for him just\r\nthen, save as they might happen to affect his future with Ona.\r\n\r\nThe marriage would have been at once, if they had had their way; but\r\nthis would mean that they would have to do without any wedding feast,\r\nand when they suggested this they came into conflict with the old\r\npeople. To Teta Elzbieta especially the very suggestion was an\r\naffliction. What! she would cry. To be married on the roadside like a\r\nparcel of beggars! No! No!\xe2\x80\x94Elzbieta had some traditions behind her; she\r\nhad been a person of importance in her girlhood\xe2\x80\x94had lived on a big\r\nestate and had servants, and might have married well and been a lady,\r\nbut for the fact that there had been nine daughters and no sons in the\r\nfamily. Even so, however, she knew what was decent, and clung to her\r\ntraditions with desperation. They were not going to lose all caste,\r\neven if they had come to be unskilled laborers in Packingtown; and that\r\nOna had even talked of omitting a _veselija_ was enough to keep her\r\nstepmother lying awake all night. It was in vain for them to say that\r\nthey had so few friends; they were bound to have friends in time, and\r\nthen the friends would talk about it. They must not give up what was\r\nright for a little money\xe2\x80\x94if they did, the money would never do them any\r\ngood, they could depend upon that. And Elzbieta would call upon Dede\r\nAntanas to support her; there was a fear in the souls of these two,\r\nlest this journey to a new country might somehow undermine the old home\r\nvirtues of their children. The very first Sunday they had all been\r\ntaken to mass; and poor as they were, Elzbieta had felt it advisable to\r\ninvest a little of her resources in a representation of the babe of\r\nBethlehem, made in plaster, and painted in brilliant colors. Though it\r\nwas only a foot high, there was a shrine with four snow-white steeples,\r\nand the Virgin standing with her child in her arms, and the kings and\r\nshepherds and wise men bowing down before him. It had cost fifty cents;\r\nbut Elzbieta had a feeling that money spent for such things was not to\r\nbe counted too closely, it would come back in hidden ways. The piece\r\nwas beautiful on the parlor mantel, and one could not have a home\r\nwithout some sort of ornament.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the wedding feast would, of course, be returned to them;\r\nbut the problem was to raise it even temporarily. They had been in the\r\nneighborhood so short a time that they could not get much credit, and\r\nthere was no one except Szedvilas from whom they could borrow even a\r\nlittle. Evening after evening Jurgis and Ona would sit and figure the\r\nexpenses, calculating the term of their separation. They could not\r\npossibly manage it decently for less than two hundred dollars, and even\r\nthough they were welcome to count in the whole of the earnings of\r\nMarija and Jonas, as a loan, they could not hope to raise this sum in\r\nless than four or five months. So Ona began thinking of seeking\r\nemployment herself, saying that if she had even ordinarily good luck,\r\nshe might be able to take two months off the time. They were just\r\nbeginning to adjust themselves to this necessity, when out of the clear\r\nsky there fell a thunderbolt upon them\xe2\x80\x94a calamity that scattered all\r\ntheir hopes to the four winds.\r\n\r\nAbout a block away from them there lived another Lithuanian family,\r\nconsisting of an elderly widow and one grown son; their name was\r\nMajauszkis, and our friends struck up an acquaintance with them before\r\nlong. One evening they came over for a visit, and naturally the first\r\nsubject upon which the conversation turned was the neighborhood and its\r\nhistory; and then Grandmother Majauszkiene, as the old lady was called,\r\nproceeded to recite to them a string of horrors that fairly froze their\r\nblood. She was a wrinkled-up and wizened personage\xe2\x80\x94she must have been\r\neighty\xe2\x80\x94and as she mumbled the grim story through her toothless gums,\r\nshe seemed a very old witch to them. Grandmother Majauszkiene had lived\r\nin the midst of misfortune so long that it had come to be her element,\r\nand she talked about starvation, sickness, and death as other people\r\nmight about weddings and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe thing came gradually. In the first place as to the house they had\r\nbought, it was not new at all, as they had supposed; it was about\r\nfifteen years old, and there was nothing new upon it but the paint,\r\nwhich was so bad that it needed to be put on new every year or two. The\r\nhouse was one of a whole row that was built by a company which existed\r\nto make money by swindling poor people. The family had paid fifteen\r\nhundred dollars for it, and it had not cost the builders five hundred,\r\nwhen it was new. Grandmother Majauszkiene knew that because her son\r\nbelonged to a political organization with a contractor who put up\r\nexactly such houses. They used the very flimsiest and cheapest\r\nmaterial; they built the houses a dozen at a time, and they cared about\r\nnothing at all except the outside shine. The family could take her word\r\nas to the trouble they would have, for she had been through it all\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nand her son had bought their house in exactly the same way. They had\r\nfooled the company, however, for her son was a skilled man, who made as\r\nhigh as a hundred dollars a month, and as he had had sense enough not\r\nto marry, they had been able to pay for the house.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Majauszkiene saw that her friends were puzzled at this\r\nremark; they did not quite see how paying for the house was \xe2\x80\x9cfooling\r\nthe company.\xe2\x80\x9d Evidently they were very inexperienced. Cheap as the\r\nhouses were, they were sold with the idea that the people who bought\r\nthem would not be able to pay for them. When they failed\xe2\x80\x94if it were\r\nonly by a single month\xe2\x80\x94they would lose the house and all that they had\r\npaid on it, and then the company would sell it over again. And did they\r\noften get a chance to do that? _Dieve!_ (Grandmother Majauszkiene\r\nraised her hands.) They did it\xe2\x80\x94how often no one could say, but\r\ncertainly more than half of the time. They might ask any one who knew\r\nanything at all about Packingtown as to that; she had been living here\r\never since this house was built, and she could tell them all about it.\r\nAnd had it ever been sold before? _Susimilkie!_ Why, since it had been\r\nbuilt, no less than four families that their informant could name had\r\ntried to buy it and failed. She would tell them a little about it.\r\n\r\nThe first family had been Germans. The families had all been of\r\ndifferent nationalities\xe2\x80\x94there had been a representative of several\r\nraces that had displaced each other in the stockyards. Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene had come to America with her son at a time when so far as\r\nshe knew there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district;\r\nthe workers had all been Germans then\xe2\x80\x94skilled cattle butchers that the\r\npackers had brought from abroad to start the business. Afterward, as\r\ncheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away. The next were the\r\nIrish\xe2\x80\x94there had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a\r\nregular Irish city. There were a few colonies of them still here,\r\nenough to run all the unions and the police force and get all the\r\ngraft; but most of those who were working in the packing houses had\r\ngone away at the next drop in wages\xe2\x80\x94after the big strike. The Bohemians\r\nhad come then, and after them the Poles. People said that old man\r\nDurham himself was responsible for these immigrations; he had sworn\r\nthat he would fix the people of Packingtown so that they would never\r\nagain call a strike on him, and so he had sent his agents into every\r\ncity and village in Europe to spread the tale of the chances of work\r\nand high wages at the stockyards. The people had come in hordes; and\r\nold Durham had squeezed them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and\r\ngrinding them to pieces and sending for new ones. The Poles, who had\r\ncome by tens of thousands, had been driven to the wall by the\r\nLithuanians, and now the Lithuanians were giving way to the Slovaks.\r\nWho there was poorer and more miserable than the Slovaks, Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene had no idea, but the packers would find them, never fear.\r\nIt was easy to bring them, for wages were really much higher, and it\r\nwas only when it was too late that the poor people found out that\r\neverything else was higher too. They were like rats in a trap, that was\r\nthe truth; and more of them were piling in every day. By and by they\r\nwould have their revenge, though, for the thing was getting beyond\r\nhuman endurance, and the people would rise and murder the packers.\r\nGrandmother Majauszkiene was a socialist, or some such strange thing;\r\nanother son of hers was working in the mines of Siberia, and the old\r\nlady herself had made speeches in her time\xe2\x80\x94which made her seem all the\r\nmore terrible to her present auditors.\r\n\r\nThey called her back to the story of the house. The German family had\r\nbeen a good sort. To be sure there had been a great many of them, which\r\nwas a common failing in Packingtown; but they had worked hard, and the\r\nfather had been a steady man, and they had a good deal more than half\r\npaid for the house. But he had been killed in an elevator accident in\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThen there had come the Irish, and there had been lots of them, too;\r\nthe husband drank and beat the children\xe2\x80\x94the neighbors could hear them\r\nshrieking any night. They were behind with their rent all the time, but\r\nthe company was good to them; there was some politics back of that,\r\nGrandmother Majauszkiene could not say just what, but the Laffertys had\r\nbelonged to the \xe2\x80\x9cWar Whoop League,\xe2\x80\x9d which was a sort of political club\r\nof all the thugs and rowdies in the district; and if you belonged to\r\nthat, you could never be arrested for anything. Once upon a time old\r\nLafferty had been caught with a gang that had stolen cows from several\r\nof the poor people of the neighborhood and butchered them in an old\r\nshanty back of the yards and sold them. He had been in jail only three\r\ndays for it, and had come out laughing, and had not even lost his place\r\nin the packing house. He had gone all to ruin with the drink, however,\r\nand lost his power; one of his sons, who was a good man, had kept him\r\nand the family up for a year or two, but then he had got sick with\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThat was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94this house was unlucky. Every family that lived in it, some one\r\nwas sure to get consumption. Nobody could tell why that was; there must\r\nbe something about the house, or the way it was built\xe2\x80\x94some folks said\r\nit was because the building had been begun in the dark of the moon.\r\nThere were dozens of houses that way in Packingtown. Sometimes there\r\nwould be a particular room that you could point out\xe2\x80\x94if anybody slept in\r\nthat room he was just as good as dead. With this house it had been the\r\nIrish first; and then a Bohemian family had lost a child of it\xe2\x80\x94though,\r\nto be sure, that was uncertain, since it was hard to tell what was the\r\nmatter with children who worked in the yards. In those days there had\r\nbeen no law about the age of children\xe2\x80\x94the packers had worked all but\r\nthe babies. At this remark the family looked puzzled, and Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene again had to make an explanation\xe2\x80\x94that it was against the\r\nlaw for children to work before they were sixteen. What was the sense\r\nof that? they asked. They had been thinking of letting little\r\nStanislovas go to work. Well, there was no need to worry, Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene said\xe2\x80\x94the law made no difference except that it forced\r\npeople to lie about the ages of their children. One would like to know\r\nwhat the lawmakers expected them to do; there were families that had no\r\npossible means of support except the children, and the law provided\r\nthem no other way of getting a living. Very often a man could get no\r\nwork in Packingtown for months, while a child could go and get a place\r\neasily; there was always some new machine, by which the packers could\r\nget as much work out of a child as they had been able to get out of a\r\nman, and for a third of the pay.\r\n\r\nTo come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family\r\nthat had died. That was after they had been there nearly four years,\r\nand this woman had had twins regularly every year\xe2\x80\x94and there had been\r\nmore than you could count when they moved in. After she died the man\r\nwould go to work all day and leave them to shift for themselves\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nneighbors would help them now and then, for they would almost freeze to\r\ndeath. At the end there were three days that they were alone, before it\r\nwas found out that the father was dead. He was a \xe2\x80\x9cfloorsman\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nJones\xe2\x80\x99s, and a wounded steer had broken loose and mashed him against a\r\npillar. Then the children had been taken away, and the company had sold\r\nthe house that very same week to a party of emigrants.\r\n\r\nSo this grim old woman went on with her tale of horrors. How much of it\r\nwas exaggeration\xe2\x80\x94who could tell? It was only too plausible. There was\r\nthat about consumption, for instance. They knew nothing about\r\nconsumption whatever, except that it made people cough; and for two\r\nweeks they had been worrying about a coughing-spell of Antanas. It\r\nseemed to shake him all over, and it never stopped; you could see a red\r\nstain wherever he had spit upon the floor.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all these things were as nothing to what came a little later.\r\nThey had begun to question the old lady as to why one family had been\r\nunable to pay, trying to show her by figures that it ought to have been\r\npossible; and Grandmother Majauszkiene had disputed their figures\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsay twelve dollars a month; but that does not include the interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they stared at her. \xe2\x80\x9cInterest!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInterest on the money you still owe,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay any interest!\xe2\x80\x9d they exclaimed, three or four\r\nat once. \xe2\x80\x9cWe only have to pay twelve dollars each month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd for this she laughed at them. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are like all the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cthey trick you and eat you alive. They never sell the houses\r\nwithout interest. Get your deed, and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, with a horrible sinking of the heart, Teta Elzbieta unlocked her\r\nbureau and brought out the paper that had already caused them so many\r\nagonies. Now they sat round, scarcely breathing, while the old lady,\r\nwho could read English, ran over it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, finally, \xe2\x80\x9chere it\r\nis, of course: \xe2\x80\x98With interest thereon monthly, at the rate of seven per\r\ncent per annum.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd there followed a dead silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jurgis\r\nfinally, almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have to pay them seven\r\ndollars next month, as well as the twelve dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen again there was not a sound. It was sickening, like a nightmare,\r\nin which suddenly something gives way beneath you, and you feel\r\nyourself sinking, sinking, down into bottomless abysses. As if in a\r\nflash of lightning they saw themselves\xe2\x80\x94victims of a relentless fate,\r\ncornered, trapped, in the grip of destruction. All the fair structure\r\nof their hopes came crashing about their ears.\xe2\x80\x94And all the time the old\r\nwoman was going on talking. They wished that she would be still; her\r\nvoice sounded like the croaking of some dismal raven. Jurgis sat with\r\nhis hands clenched and beads of perspiration on his forehead, and there\r\nwas a great lump in Ona\xe2\x80\x99s throat, choking her. Then suddenly Teta\r\nElzbieta broke the silence with a wail, and Marija began to wring her\r\nhands and sob, \xe2\x80\x9c_Ai! Ai! Beda man!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll their outcry did them no good, of course. There sat Grandmother\r\nMajauszkiene, unrelenting, typifying fate. No, of course it was not\r\nfair, but then fairness had nothing to do with it. And of course they\r\nhad not known it. They had not been intended to know it. But it was in\r\nthe deed, and that was all that was necessary, as they would find when\r\nthe time came.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other they got rid of their guest, and then they passed a\r\nnight of lamentation. The children woke up and found out that something\r\nwas wrong, and they wailed and would not be comforted. In the morning,\r\nof course, most of them had to go to work, the packing houses would not\r\nstop for their sorrows; but by seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Ona and her stepmother\r\nwere standing at the door of the office of the agent. Yes, he told\r\nthem, when he came, it was quite true that they would have to pay\r\ninterest. And then Teta Elzbieta broke forth into protestations and\r\nreproaches, so that the people outside stopped and peered in at the\r\nwindow. The agent was as bland as ever. He was deeply pained, he said.\r\nHe had not told them, simply because he had supposed they would\r\nunderstand that they had to pay interest upon their debt, as a matter\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nSo they came away, and Ona went down to the yards, and at noontime saw\r\nJurgis and told him. Jurgis took it stolidly\xe2\x80\x94he had made up his mind to\r\nit by this time. It was part of fate; they would manage it somehow\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nmade his usual answer, \xe2\x80\x9cI will work harder.\xe2\x80\x9d It would upset their plans\r\nfor a time; and it would perhaps be necessary for Ona to get work after\r\nall. Then Ona added that Teta Elzbieta had decided that little\r\nStanislovas would have to work too. It was not fair to let Jurgis and\r\nher support the family\xe2\x80\x94the family would have to help as it could.\r\nPreviously Jurgis had scouted this idea, but now knit his brows and\r\nnodded his head slowly\xe2\x80\x94yes, perhaps it would be best; they would all\r\nhave to make some sacrifices now.\r\n\r\nSo Ona set out that day to hunt for work; and at night Marija came home\r\nsaying that she had met a girl named Jasaityte who had a friend that\r\nworked in one of the wrapping rooms in Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, and might get a place\r\nfor Ona there; only the forelady was the kind that takes presents\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas no use for any one to ask her for a place unless at the same time\r\nthey slipped a ten-dollar bill into her hand. Jurgis was not in the\r\nleast surprised at this now\xe2\x80\x94he merely asked what the wages of the place\r\nwould be. So negotiations were opened, and after an interview Ona came\r\nhome and reported that the forelady seemed to like her, and had said\r\nthat, while she was not sure, she thought she might be able to put her\r\nat work sewing covers on hams, a job at which she would earn as much as\r\neight or ten dollars a week. That was a bid, so Marija reported, after\r\nconsulting her friend; and then there was an anxious conference at\r\nhome. The work was done in one of the cellars, and Jurgis did not want\r\nOna to work in such a place; but then it was easy work, and one could\r\nnot have everything. So in the end Ona, with a ten-dollar bill burning\r\na hole in her palm, had another interview with the forelady.\r\n\r\nMeantime Teta Elzbieta had taken Stanislovas to the priest and gotten a\r\ncertificate to the effect that he was two years older than he was; and\r\nwith it the little boy now sallied forth to make his fortune in the\r\nworld. It chanced that Durham had just put in a wonderful new lard\r\nmachine, and when the special policeman in front of the time station\r\nsaw Stanislovas and his document, he smiled to himself and told him to\r\ngo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCzia! Czia!\xe2\x80\x9d pointing. And so Stanislovas went down a long stone\r\ncorridor, and up a flight of stairs, which took him into a room lighted\r\nby electricity, with the new machines for filling lard cans at work in\r\nit. The lard was finished on the floor above, and it came in little\r\njets, like beautiful, wriggling, snow-white snakes of unpleasant odor.\r\nThere were several kinds and sizes of jets, and after a certain precise\r\nquantity had come out, each stopped automatically, and the wonderful\r\nmachine made a turn, and took the can under another jet, and so on,\r\nuntil it was filled neatly to the brim, and pressed tightly, and\r\nsmoothed off. To attend to all this and fill several hundred cans of\r\nlard per hour, there were necessary two human creatures, one of whom\r\nknew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few\r\nseconds, and the other of whom knew how to take a full lard can off a\r\ncertain spot every few seconds and set it upon a tray.\r\n\r\nAnd so, after little Stanislovas had stood gazing timidly about him for\r\na few minutes, a man approached him, and asked what he wanted, to which\r\nStanislovas said, \xe2\x80\x9cJob.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the man said \xe2\x80\x9cHow old?\xe2\x80\x9d and Stanislovas\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cSixtin.\xe2\x80\x9d Once or twice every year a state inspector would\r\ncome wandering through the packing plants, asking a child here and\r\nthere how old he was; and so the packers were very careful to comply\r\nwith the law, which cost them as much trouble as was now involved in\r\nthe boss\xe2\x80\x99s taking the document from the little boy, and glancing at it,\r\nand then sending it to the office to be filed away. Then he set some\r\none else at a different job, and showed the lad how to place a lard can\r\nevery time the empty arm of the remorseless machine came to him; and so\r\nwas decided the place in the universe of little Stanislovas, and his\r\ndestiny till the end of his days. Hour after hour, day after day, year\r\nafter year, it was fated that he should stand upon a certain square\r\nfoot of floor from seven in the morning until noon, and again from\r\nhalf-past twelve till half-past five, making never a motion and\r\nthinking never a thought, save for the setting of lard cans. In summer\r\nthe stench of the warm lard would be nauseating, and in winter the cans\r\nwould all but freeze to his naked little fingers in the unheated\r\ncellar. Half the year it would be dark as night when he went in to\r\nwork, and dark as night again when he came out, and so he would never\r\nknow what the sun looked like on weekdays. And for this, at the end of\r\nthe week, he would carry home three dollars to his family, being his\r\npay at the rate of five cents per hour\xe2\x80\x94just about his proper share of\r\nthe total earnings of the million and three-quarters of children who\r\nare now engaged in earning their livings in the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd meantime, because they were young, and hope is not to be stifled\r\nbefore its time, Jurgis and Ona were again calculating; for they had\r\ndiscovered that the wages of Stanislovas would a little more than pay\r\nthe interest, which left them just about as they had been before! It\r\nwould be but fair to them to say that the little boy was delighted with\r\nhis work, and at the idea of earning a lot of money; and also that the\r\ntwo were very much in love with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll summer long the family toiled, and in the fall they had money\r\nenough for Jurgis and Ona to be married according to home traditions of\r\ndecency. In the latter part of November they hired a hall, and invited\r\nall their new acquaintances, who came and left them over a hundred\r\ndollars in debt.\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter and cruel experience, and it plunged them into an agony\r\nof despair. Such a time, of all times, for them to have it, when their\r\nhearts were made tender! Such a pitiful beginning it was for their\r\nmarried life; they loved each other so, and they could not have the\r\nbriefest respite! It was a time when everything cried out to them that\r\nthey ought to be happy; when wonder burned in their hearts, and leaped\r\ninto flame at the slightest breath. They were shaken to the depths of\r\nthem, with the awe of love realized\xe2\x80\x94and was it so very weak of them\r\nthat they cried out for a little peace? They had opened their hearts,\r\nlike flowers to the springtime, and the merciless winter had fallen\r\nupon them. They wondered if ever any love that had blossomed in the\r\nworld had been so crushed and trampled!\r\n\r\nOver them, relentless and savage, there cracked the lash of want; the\r\nmorning after the wedding it sought them as they slept, and drove them\r\nout before daybreak to work. Ona was scarcely able to stand with\r\nexhaustion; but if she were to lose her place they would be ruined, and\r\nshe would surely lose it if she were not on time that day. They all had\r\nto go, even little Stanislovas, who was ill from overindulgence in\r\nsausages and sarsaparilla. All that day he stood at his lard machine,\r\nrocking unsteadily, his eyes closing in spite of him; and he all but\r\nlost his place even so, for the foreman booted him twice to waken him.\r\n\r\nIt was fully a week before they were all normal again, and meantime,\r\nwith whining children and cross adults, the house was not a pleasant\r\nplace to live in. Jurgis lost his temper very little, however, all\r\nthings considered. It was because of Ona; the least glance at her was\r\nalways enough to make him control himself. She was so sensitive\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nnot fitted for such a life as this; and a hundred times a day, when he\r\nthought of her, he would clench his hands and fling himself again at\r\nthe task before him. She was too good for him, he told himself, and he\r\nwas afraid, because she was his. So long he had hungered to possess\r\nher, but now that the time had come he knew that he had not earned the\r\nright; that she trusted him so was all her own simple goodness, and no\r\nvirtue of his. But he was resolved that she should never find this out,\r\nand so was always on the watch to see that he did not betray any of his\r\nugly self; he would take care even in little matters, such as his\r\nmanners, and his habit of swearing when things went wrong. The tears\r\ncame so easily into Ona\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and she would look at him so\r\nappealingly\xe2\x80\x94it kept Jurgis quite busy making resolutions, in addition\r\nto all the other things he had on his mind. It was true that more\r\nthings were going on at this time in the mind of Jurgis than ever had\r\nin all his life before.\r\n\r\nHe had to protect her, to do battle for her against the horror he saw\r\nabout them. He was all that she had to look to, and if he failed she\r\nwould be lost; he would wrap his arms about her, and try to hide her\r\nfrom the world. He had learned the ways of things about him now. It was\r\na war of each against all, and the devil take the hindmost. You did not\r\ngive feasts to other people, you waited for them to give feasts to you.\r\nYou went about with your soul full of suspicion and hatred; you\r\nunderstood that you were environed by hostile powers that were trying\r\nto get your money, and who used all the virtues to bait their traps\r\nwith. The store-keepers plastered up their windows with all sorts of\r\nlies to entice you; the very fences by the wayside, the lampposts and\r\ntelegraph poles, were pasted over with lies. The great corporation\r\nwhich employed you lied to you, and lied to the whole country\xe2\x80\x94from top\r\nto bottom it was nothing but one gigantic lie.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis said that he understood it; and yet it was really pitiful,\r\nfor the struggle was so unfair\xe2\x80\x94some had so much the advantage! Here he\r\nwas, for instance, vowing upon his knees that he would save Ona from\r\nharm, and only a week later she was suffering atrociously, and from the\r\nblow of an enemy that he could not possibly have thwarted. There came a\r\nday when the rain fell in torrents; and it being December, to be wet\r\nwith it and have to sit all day long in one of the cold cellars of\r\nBrown\xe2\x80\x99s was no laughing matter. Ona was a working girl, and did not own\r\nwaterproofs and such things, and so Jurgis took her and put her on the\r\nstreetcar. Now it chanced that this car line was owned by gentlemen who\r\nwere trying to make money. And the city having passed an ordinance\r\nrequiring them to give transfers, they had fallen into a rage; and\r\nfirst they had made a rule that transfers could be had only when the\r\nfare was paid; and later, growing still uglier, they had made\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94that the passenger must ask for the transfer, the conductor was\r\nnot allowed to offer it. Now Ona had been told that she was to get a\r\ntransfer; but it was not her way to speak up, and so she merely waited,\r\nfollowing the conductor about with her eyes, wondering when he would\r\nthink of her. When at last the time came for her to get out, she asked\r\nfor the transfer, and was refused. Not knowing what to make of this,\r\nshe began to argue with the conductor, in a language of which he did\r\nnot understand a word. After warning her several times, he pulled the\r\nbell and the car went on\xe2\x80\x94at which Ona burst into tears. At the next\r\ncorner she got out, of course; and as she had no more money, she had to\r\nwalk the rest of the way to the yards in the pouring rain. And so all\r\nday long she sat shivering, and came home at night with her teeth\r\nchattering and pains in her head and back. For two weeks afterward she\r\nsuffered cruelly\xe2\x80\x94and yet every day she had to drag herself to her work.\r\nThe forewoman was especially severe with Ona, because she believed that\r\nshe was obstinate on account of having been refused a holiday the day\r\nafter her wedding. Ona had an idea that her \xe2\x80\x9cforelady\xe2\x80\x9d did not like to\r\nhave her girls marry\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because she was old and ugly and unmarried\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThere were many such dangers, in which the odds were all against them.\r\nTheir children were not as well as they had been at home; but how could\r\nthey know that there was no sewer to their house, and that the drainage\r\nof fifteen years was in a cesspool under it? How could they know that\r\nthe pale-blue milk that they bought around the corner was watered, and\r\ndoctored with formaldehyde besides? When the children were not well at\r\nhome, Teta Elzbieta would gather herbs and cure them; now she was\r\nobliged to go to the drugstore and buy extracts\xe2\x80\x94and how was she to know\r\nthat they were all adulterated? How could they find out that their tea\r\nand coffee, their sugar and flour, had been doctored; that their canned\r\npeas had been colored with copper salts, and their fruit jams with\r\naniline dyes? And even if they had known it, what good would it have\r\ndone them, since there was no place within miles of them where any\r\nother sort was to be had? The bitter winter was coming, and they had to\r\nsave money to get more clothing and bedding; but it would not matter in\r\nthe least how much they saved, they could not get anything to keep them\r\nwarm. All the clothing that was to be had in the stores was made of\r\ncotton and shoddy, which is made by tearing old clothes to pieces and\r\nweaving the fiber again. If they paid higher prices, they might get\r\nfrills and fanciness, or be cheated; but genuine quality they could not\r\nobtain for love nor money. A young friend of Szedvilas\xe2\x80\x99, recently come\r\nfrom abroad, had become a clerk in a store on Ashland Avenue, and he\r\nnarrated with glee a trick that had been played upon an unsuspecting\r\ncountryman by his boss. The customer had desired to purchase an alarm\r\nclock, and the boss had shown him two exactly similar, telling him that\r\nthe price of one was a dollar and of the other a dollar seventy-five.\r\nUpon being asked what the difference was, the man had wound up the\r\nfirst halfway and the second all the way, and showed the customer how\r\nthe latter made twice as much noise; upon which the customer remarked\r\nthat he was a sound sleeper, and had better take the more expensive\r\nclock!\r\n\r\nThere is a poet who sings that\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeeper their heart grows and nobler their bearing,\r\nWhose youth in the fires of anguish hath died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was not likely that he had reference to the kind of anguish that\r\ncomes with destitution, that is so endlessly bitter and cruel, and yet\r\nso sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating\xe2\x80\x94unredeemed by the\r\nslightest touch of dignity or even of pathos. It is a kind of anguish\r\nthat poets have not commonly dealt with; its very words are not\r\nadmitted into the vocabulary of poets\xe2\x80\x94the details of it cannot be told\r\nin polite society at all. How, for instance, could any one expect to\r\nexcite sympathy among lovers of good literature by telling how a family\r\nfound their home alive with vermin, and of all the suffering and\r\ninconvenience and humiliation they were put to, and the hard-earned\r\nmoney they spent, in efforts to get rid of them? After long hesitation\r\nand uncertainty they paid twenty-five cents for a big package of insect\r\npowder\xe2\x80\x94a patent preparation which chanced to be ninety-five per cent\r\ngypsum, a harmless earth which had cost about two cents to prepare. Of\r\ncourse it had not the least effect, except upon a few roaches which had\r\nthe misfortune to drink water after eating it, and so got their inwards\r\nset in a coating of plaster of Paris. The family, having no idea of\r\nthis, and no more money to throw away, had nothing to do but give up\r\nand submit to one more misery for the rest of their days.\r\n\r\nThen there was old Antanas. The winter came, and the place where he\r\nworked was a dark, unheated cellar, where you could see your breath all\r\nday, and where your fingers sometimes tried to freeze. So the old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncough grew every day worse, until there came a time when it hardly ever\r\nstopped, and he had become a nuisance about the place. Then, too, a\r\nstill more dreadful thing happened to him; he worked in a place where\r\nhis feet were soaked in chemicals, and it was not long before they had\r\neaten through his new boots. Then sores began to break out on his feet,\r\nand grow worse and worse. Whether it was that his blood was bad, or\r\nthere had been a cut, he could not say; but he asked the men about it,\r\nand learned that it was a regular thing\xe2\x80\x94it was the saltpeter. Every one\r\nfelt it, sooner or later, and then it was all up with him, at least for\r\nthat sort of work. The sores would never heal\xe2\x80\x94in the end his toes would\r\ndrop off, if he did not quit. Yet old Antanas would not quit; he saw\r\nthe suffering of his family, and he remembered what it had cost him to\r\nget a job. So he tied up his feet, and went on limping about and\r\ncoughing, until at last he fell to pieces, all at once and in a heap,\r\nlike the One-Horse Shay. They carried him to a dry place and laid him\r\non the floor, and that night two of the men helped him home. The poor\r\nold man was put to bed, and though he tried it every morning until the\r\nend, he never could get up again. He would lie there and cough and\r\ncough, day and night, wasting away to a mere skeleton. There came a\r\ntime when there was so little flesh on him that the bones began to poke\r\nthrough\xe2\x80\x94which was a horrible thing to see or even to think of. And one\r\nnight he had a choking fit, and a little river of blood came out of his\r\nmouth. The family, wild with terror, sent for a doctor, and paid half a\r\ndollar to be told that there was nothing to be done. Mercifully the\r\ndoctor did not say this so that the old man could hear, for he was\r\nstill clinging to the faith that tomorrow or next day he would be\r\nbetter, and could go back to his job. The company had sent word to him\r\nthat they would keep it for him\xe2\x80\x94or rather Jurgis had bribed one of the\r\nmen to come one Sunday afternoon and say they had. Dede Antanas\r\ncontinued to believe it, while three more hemorrhages came; and then at\r\nlast one morning they found him stiff and cold. Things were not going\r\nwell with them then, and though it nearly broke Teta Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nthey were forced to dispense with nearly all the decencies of a\r\nfuneral; they had only a hearse, and one hack for the women and\r\nchildren; and Jurgis, who was learning things fast, spent all Sunday\r\nmaking a bargain for these, and he made it in the presence of\r\nwitnesses, so that when the man tried to charge him for all sorts of\r\nincidentals, he did not have to pay. For twenty-five years old Antanas\r\nRudkus and his son had dwelt in the forest together, and it was hard to\r\npart in this way; perhaps it was just as well that Jurgis had to give\r\nall his attention to the task of having a funeral without being\r\nbankrupted, and so had no time to indulge in memories and grief.\r\n\r\nNow the dreadful winter was come upon them. In the forests, all summer\r\nlong, the branches of the trees do battle for light, and some of them\r\nlose and die; and then come the raging blasts, and the storms of snow\r\nand hail, and strew the ground with these weaker branches. Just so it\r\nwas in Packingtown; the whole district braced itself for the struggle\r\nthat was an agony, and those whose time was come died off in hordes.\r\nAll the year round they had been serving as cogs in the great packing\r\nmachine; and now was the time for the renovating of it, and the\r\nreplacing of damaged parts. There came pneumonia and grippe, stalking\r\namong them, seeking for weakened constitutions; there was the annual\r\nharvest of those whom tuberculosis had been dragging down. There came\r\ncruel, cold, and biting winds, and blizzards of snow, all testing\r\nrelentlessly for failing muscles and impoverished blood. Sooner or\r\nlater came the day when the unfit one did not report for work; and\r\nthen, with no time lost in waiting, and no inquiries or regrets, there\r\nwas a chance for a new hand.\r\n\r\nThe new hands were here by the thousands. All day long the gates of the\r\npacking houses were besieged by starving and penniless men; they came,\r\nliterally, by the thousands every single morning, fighting with each\r\nother for a chance for life. Blizzards and cold made no difference to\r\nthem, they were always on hand; they were on hand two hours before the\r\nsun rose, an hour before the work began. Sometimes their faces froze,\r\nsometimes their feet and their hands; sometimes they froze all\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94but still they came, for they had no other place to go. One\r\nday Durham advertised in the paper for two hundred men to cut ice; and\r\nall that day the homeless and starving of the city came trudging\r\nthrough the snow from all over its two hundred square miles. That night\r\nforty score of them crowded into the station house of the stockyards\r\ndistrict\xe2\x80\x94they filled the rooms, sleeping in each other\xe2\x80\x99s laps, toboggan\r\nfashion, and they piled on top of each other in the corridors, till the\r\npolice shut the doors and left some to freeze outside. On the morrow,\r\nbefore daybreak, there were three thousand at Durham\xe2\x80\x99s, and the police\r\nreserves had to be sent for to quell the riot. Then Durham\xe2\x80\x99s bosses\r\npicked out twenty of the biggest; the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo hundred\xe2\x80\x9d proved to have been\r\na printer\xe2\x80\x99s error.\r\n\r\nFour or five miles to the eastward lay the lake, and over this the\r\nbitter winds came raging. Sometimes the thermometer would fall to ten\r\nor twenty degrees below zero at night, and in the morning the streets\r\nwould be piled with snowdrifts up to the first-floor windows. The\r\nstreets through which our friends had to go to their work were all\r\nunpaved and full of deep holes and gullies; in summer, when it rained\r\nhard, a man might have to wade to his waist to get to his house; and\r\nnow in winter it was no joke getting through these places, before light\r\nin the morning and after dark at night. They would wrap up in all they\r\nowned, but they could not wrap up against exhaustion; and many a man\r\ngave out in these battles with the snowdrifts, and lay down and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nAnd if it was bad for the men, one may imagine how the women and\r\nchildren fared. Some would ride in the cars, if the cars were running;\r\nbut when you are making only five cents an hour, as was little\r\nStanislovas, you do not like to spend that much to ride two miles. The\r\nchildren would come to the yards with great shawls about their ears,\r\nand so tied up that you could hardly find them\xe2\x80\x94and still there would be\r\naccidents. One bitter morning in February the little boy who worked at\r\nthe lard machine with Stanislovas came about an hour late, and\r\nscreaming with pain. They unwrapped him, and a man began vigorously\r\nrubbing his ears; and as they were frozen stiff, it took only two or\r\nthree rubs to break them short off. As a result of this, little\r\nStanislovas conceived a terror of the cold that was almost a mania.\r\nEvery morning, when it came time to start for the yards, he would begin\r\nto cry and protest. Nobody knew quite how to manage him, for threats\r\ndid no good\xe2\x80\x94it seemed to be something that he could not control, and\r\nthey feared sometimes that he would go into convulsions. In the end it\r\nhad to be arranged that he always went with Jurgis, and came home with\r\nhim again; and often, when the snow was deep, the man would carry him\r\nthe whole way on his shoulders. Sometimes Jurgis would be working until\r\nlate at night, and then it was pitiful, for there was no place for the\r\nlittle fellow to wait, save in the doorways or in a corner of the\r\nkilling beds, and he would all but fall asleep there, and freeze to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThere was no heat upon the killing beds; the men might exactly as well\r\nhave worked out of doors all winter. For that matter, there was very\r\nlittle heat anywhere in the building, except in the cooking rooms and\r\nsuch places\xe2\x80\x94and it was the men who worked in these who ran the most\r\nrisk of all, because whenever they had to pass to another room they had\r\nto go through ice-cold corridors, and sometimes with nothing on above\r\nthe waist except a sleeveless undershirt. On the killing beds you were\r\napt to be covered with blood, and it would freeze solid; if you leaned\r\nagainst a pillar, you would freeze to that, and if you put your hand\r\nupon the blade of your knife, you would run a chance of leaving your\r\nskin on it. The men would tie up their feet in newspapers and old\r\nsacks, and these would be soaked in blood and frozen, and then soaked\r\nagain, and so on, until by nighttime a man would be walking on great\r\nlumps the size of the feet of an elephant. Now and then, when the\r\nbosses were not looking, you would see them plunging their feet and\r\nankles into the steaming hot carcass of the steer, or darting across\r\nthe room to the hot-water jets. The cruelest thing of all was that\r\nnearly all of them\xe2\x80\x94all of those who used knives\xe2\x80\x94were unable to wear\r\ngloves, and their arms would be white with frost and their hands would\r\ngrow numb, and then of course there would be accidents. Also the air\r\nwould be full of steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that\r\nyou could not see five feet before you; and then, with men rushing\r\nabout at the speed they kept up on the killing beds, and all with\r\nbutcher knives, like razors, in their hands\xe2\x80\x94well, it was to be counted\r\nas a wonder that there were not more men slaughtered than cattle.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all this inconvenience they might have put up with, if only it\r\nhad not been for one thing\xe2\x80\x94if only there had been some place where they\r\nmight eat. Jurgis had either to eat his dinner amid the stench in which\r\nhe had worked, or else to rush, as did all his companions, to any one\r\nof the hundreds of liquor stores which stretched out their arms to him.\r\nTo the west of the yards ran Ashland Avenue, and here was an unbroken\r\nline of saloons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhiskey Row,\xe2\x80\x9d they called it; to the north was\r\nForty-seventh Street, where there were half a dozen to the block, and\r\nat the angle of the two was \xe2\x80\x9cWhiskey Point,\xe2\x80\x9d a space of fifteen or\r\ntwenty acres, and containing one glue factory and about two hundred\r\nsaloons.\r\n\r\nOne might walk among these and take his choice: \xe2\x80\x9cHot pea-soup and\r\nboiled cabbage today.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSauerkraut and hot frankfurters. Walk in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBean soup and stewed lamb. Welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d All of these things were printed\r\nin many languages, as were also the names of the resorts, which were\r\ninfinite in their variety and appeal. There was the \xe2\x80\x9cHome Circle\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cCosey Corner\xe2\x80\x9d; there were \xe2\x80\x9cFiresides\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHearthstones\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasure Palaces\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWonderlands\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDream Castles\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLove\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDelights.\xe2\x80\x9d Whatever else they were called, they were sure to be called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnion Headquarters,\xe2\x80\x9d and to hold out a welcome to workingmen; and\r\nthere was always a warm stove, and a chair near it, and some friends to\r\nlaugh and talk with. There was only one condition attached,\xe2\x80\x94you must\r\ndrink. If you went in not intending to drink, you would be put out in\r\nno time, and if you were slow about going, like as not you would get\r\nyour head split open with a beer bottle in the bargain. But all of the\r\nmen understood the convention and drank; they believed that by it they\r\nwere getting something for nothing\xe2\x80\x94for they did not need to take more\r\nthan one drink, and upon the strength of it they might fill themselves\r\nup with a good hot dinner. This did not always work out in practice,\r\nhowever, for there was pretty sure to be a friend who would treat you,\r\nand then you would have to treat him. Then some one else would come\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94and, anyhow, a few drinks were good for a man who worked hard. As he\r\nwent back he did not shiver so, he had more courage for his task; the\r\ndeadly brutalizing monotony of it did not afflict him so,\xe2\x80\x94he had ideas\r\nwhile he worked, and took a more cheerful view of his circumstances. On\r\nthe way home, however, the shivering was apt to come on him again; and\r\nso he would have to stop once or twice to warm up against the cruel\r\ncold. As there were hot things to eat in this saloon too, he might get\r\nhome late to his supper, or he might not get home at all. And then his\r\nwife might set out to look for him, and she too would feel the cold;\r\nand perhaps she would have some of the children with her\xe2\x80\x94and so a whole\r\nfamily would drift into drinking, as the current of a river drifts\r\ndownstream. As if to complete the chain, the packers all paid their men\r\nin checks, refusing all requests to pay in coin; and where in\r\nPackingtown could a man go to have his check cashed but to a saloon,\r\nwhere he could pay for the favor by spending a part of the money?\r\n\r\nFrom all of these things Jurgis was saved because of Ona. He never\r\nwould take but the one drink at noontime; and so he got the reputation\r\nof being a surly fellow, and was not quite welcome at the saloons, and\r\nhad to drift about from one to another. Then at night he would go\r\nstraight home, helping Ona and Stanislovas, or often putting the former\r\non a car. And when he got home perhaps he would have to trudge several\r\nblocks, and come staggering back through the snowdrifts with a bag of\r\ncoal upon his shoulder. Home was not a very attractive place\xe2\x80\x94at least\r\nnot this winter. They had only been able to buy one stove, and this was\r\na small one, and proved not big enough to warm even the kitchen in the\r\nbitterest weather. This made it hard for Teta Elzbieta all day, and for\r\nthe children when they could not get to school. At night they would sit\r\nhuddled round this stove, while they ate their supper off their laps;\r\nand then Jurgis and Jonas would smoke a pipe, after which they would\r\nall crawl into their beds to get warm, after putting out the fire to\r\nsave the coal. Then they would have some frightful experiences with the\r\ncold. They would sleep with all their clothes on, including their\r\novercoats, and put over them all the bedding and spare clothing they\r\nowned; the children would sleep all crowded into one bed, and yet even\r\nso they could not keep warm. The outside ones would be shivering and\r\nsobbing, crawling over the others and trying to get down into the\r\ncenter, and causing a fight. This old house with the leaky\r\nweatherboards was a very different thing from their cabins at home,\r\nwith great thick walls plastered inside and outside with mud; and the\r\ncold which came upon them was a living thing, a demon-presence in the\r\nroom. They would waken in the midnight hours, when everything was\r\nblack; perhaps they would hear it yelling outside, or perhaps there\r\nwould be deathlike stillness\xe2\x80\x94and that would be worse yet. They could\r\nfeel the cold as it crept in through the cracks, reaching out for them\r\nwith its icy, death-dealing fingers; and they would crouch and cower,\r\nand try to hide from it, all in vain. It would come, and it would come;\r\na grisly thing, a specter born in the black caverns of terror; a power\r\nprimeval, cosmic, shadowing the tortures of the lost souls flung out to\r\nchaos and destruction. It was cruel iron-hard; and hour after hour they\r\nwould cringe in its grasp, alone, alone. There would be no one to hear\r\nthem if they cried out; there would be no help, no mercy. And so on\r\nuntil morning\xe2\x80\x94when they would go out to another day of toil, a little\r\nweaker, a little nearer to the time when it would be their turn to be\r\nshaken from the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nYet even by this deadly winter the germ of hope was not to be kept from\r\nsprouting in their hearts. It was just at this time that the great\r\nadventure befell Marija.\r\n\r\nThe victim was Tamoszius Kuszleika, who played the violin. Everybody\r\nlaughed at them, for Tamoszius was petite and frail, and Marija could\r\nhave picked him up and carried him off under one arm. But perhaps that\r\nwas why she fascinated him; the sheer volume of Marija\xe2\x80\x99s energy was\r\noverwhelming. That first night at the wedding Tamoszius had hardly\r\ntaken his eyes off her; and later on, when he came to find that she had\r\nreally the heart of a baby, her voice and her violence ceased to\r\nterrify him, and he got the habit of coming to pay her visits on Sunday\r\nafternoons. There was no place to entertain company except in the\r\nkitchen, in the midst of the family, and Tamoszius would sit there with\r\nhis hat between his knees, never saying more than half a dozen words at\r\na time, and turning red in the face before he managed to say those;\r\nuntil finally Jurgis would clap him upon the back, in his hearty way,\r\ncrying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome now, brother, give us a tune.\xe2\x80\x9d And then Tamoszius\xe2\x80\x99 face\r\nwould light up and he would get out his fiddle, tuck it under his chin,\r\nand play. And forthwith the soul of him would flame up and become\r\neloquent\xe2\x80\x94it was almost an impropriety, for all the while his gaze would\r\nbe fixed upon Marija\xe2\x80\x99s face, until she would begin to turn red and\r\nlower her eyes. There was no resisting the music of Tamoszius, however;\r\neven the children would sit awed and wondering, and the tears would run\r\ndown Teta Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks. A wonderful privilege it was to be thus\r\nadmitted into the soul of a man of genius, to be allowed to share the\r\necstasies and the agonies of his inmost life.\r\n\r\nThen there were other benefits accruing to Marija from this\r\nfriendship\xe2\x80\x94benefits of a more substantial nature. People paid Tamoszius\r\nbig money to come and make music on state occasions; and also they\r\nwould invite him to parties and festivals, knowing well that he was too\r\ngood-natured to come without his fiddle, and that having brought it, he\r\ncould be made to play while others danced. Once he made bold to ask\r\nMarija to accompany him to such a party, and Marija accepted, to his\r\ngreat delight\xe2\x80\x94after which he never went anywhere without her, while if\r\nthe celebration were given by friends of his, he would invite the rest\r\nof the family also. In any case Marija would bring back a huge\r\npocketful of cakes and sandwiches for the children, and stories of all\r\nthe good things she herself had managed to consume. She was compelled,\r\nat these parties, to spend most of her time at the refreshment table,\r\nfor she could not dance with anybody except other women and very old\r\nmen; Tamoszius was of an excitable temperament, and afflicted with a\r\nfrantic jealousy, and any unmarried man who ventured to put his arm\r\nabout the ample waist of Marija would be certain to throw the orchestra\r\nout of tune.\r\n\r\nIt was a great help to a person who had to toil all the week to be able\r\nto look forward to some such relaxation as this on Saturday nights. The\r\nfamily was too poor and too hardworked to make many acquaintances; in\r\nPackingtown, as a rule, people know only their near neighbors and\r\nshopmates, and so the place is like a myriad of little country\r\nvillages. But now there was a member of the family who was permitted to\r\ntravel and widen her horizon; and so each week there would be new\r\npersonalities to talk about,\xe2\x80\x94how so-and-so was dressed, and where she\r\nworked, and what she got, and whom she was in love with; and how this\r\nman had jilted his girl, and how she had quarreled with the other girl,\r\nand what had passed between them; and how another man beat his wife,\r\nand spent all her earnings upon drink, and pawned her very clothes.\r\nSome people would have scorned this talk as gossip; but then one has to\r\ntalk about what one knows.\r\n\r\nIt was one Saturday night, as they were coming home from a wedding,\r\nthat Tamoszius found courage, and set down his violin case in the\r\nstreet and spoke his heart; and then Marija clasped him in her arms.\r\nShe told them all about it the next day, and fairly cried with\r\nhappiness, for she said that Tamoszius was a lovely man. After that he\r\nno longer made love to her with his fiddle, but they would sit for\r\nhours in the kitchen, blissfully happy in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms; it was the\r\ntacit convention of the family to know nothing of what was going on in\r\nthat corner.\r\n\r\nThey were planning to be married in the spring, and have the garret of\r\nthe house fixed up, and live there. Tamoszius made good wages; and\r\nlittle by little the family were paying back their debt to Marija, so\r\nshe ought soon to have enough to start life upon\xe2\x80\x94only, with her\r\npreposterous softheartedness, she would insist upon spending a good\r\npart of her money every week for things which she saw they needed.\r\nMarija was really the capitalist of the party, for she had become an\r\nexpert can painter by this time\xe2\x80\x94she was getting fourteen cents for\r\nevery hundred and ten cans, and she could paint more than two cans\r\nevery minute. Marija felt, so to speak, that she had her hand on the\r\nthrottle, and the neighborhood was vocal with her rejoicings.\r\n\r\nYet her friends would shake their heads and tell her to go slow; one\r\ncould not count upon such good fortune forever\xe2\x80\x94there were accidents\r\nthat always happened. But Marija was not to be prevailed upon, and went\r\non planning and dreaming of all the treasures she was going to have for\r\nher home; and so, when the crash did come, her grief was painful to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nFor her canning factory shut down! Marija would about as soon have\r\nexpected to see the sun shut down\xe2\x80\x94the huge establishment had been to\r\nher a thing akin to the planets and the seasons. But now it was shut!\r\nAnd they had not given her any explanation, they had not even given her\r\na day\xe2\x80\x99s warning; they had simply posted a notice one Saturday that all\r\nhands would be paid off that afternoon, and would not resume work for\r\nat least a month! And that was all that there was to it\xe2\x80\x94her job was\r\ngone!\r\n\r\nIt was the holiday rush that was over, the girls said in answer to\r\nMarija\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries; after that there was always a slack. Sometimes the\r\nfactory would start up on half time after a while, but there was no\r\ntelling\xe2\x80\x94it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer. The\r\nprospects were bad at present, for truckmen who worked in the\r\nstorerooms said that these were piled up to the ceilings, so that the\r\nfirm could not have found room for another week\xe2\x80\x99s output of cans. And\r\nthey had turned off three-quarters of these men, which was a still\r\nworse sign, since it meant that there were no orders to be filled. It\r\nwas all a swindle, can-painting, said the girls\xe2\x80\x94you were crazy with\r\ndelight because you were making twelve or fourteen dollars a week, and\r\nsaving half of it; but you had to spend it all keeping alive while you\r\nwere out, and so your pay was really only half what you thought.\r\n\r\nMarija came home, and because she was a person who could not rest\r\nwithout danger of explosion, they first had a great house cleaning, and\r\nthen she set out to search Packingtown for a job to fill up the gap. As\r\nnearly all the canning establishments were shut down, and all the girls\r\nhunting work, it will be readily understood that Marija did not find\r\nany. Then she took to trying the stores and saloons, and when this\r\nfailed she even traveled over into the far-distant regions near the\r\nlake front, where lived the rich people in great palaces, and begged\r\nthere for some sort of work that could be done by a person who did not\r\nknow English.\r\n\r\nThe men upon the killing beds felt also the effects of the slump which\r\nhad turned Marija out; but they felt it in a different way, and a way\r\nwhich made Jurgis understand at last all their bitterness. The big\r\npackers did not turn their hands off and close down, like the canning\r\nfactories; but they began to run for shorter and shorter hours. They\r\nhad always required the men to be on the killing beds and ready for\r\nwork at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, although there was almost never any work to be\r\ndone till the buyers out in the yards had gotten to work, and some\r\ncattle had come over the chutes. That would often be ten or eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, which was bad enough, in all conscience; but now, in the slack\r\nseason, they would perhaps not have a thing for their men to do till\r\nlate in the afternoon. And so they would have to loaf around, in a\r\nplace where the thermometer might be twenty degrees below zero! At\r\nfirst one would see them running about, or skylarking with each other,\r\ntrying to keep warm; but before the day was over they would become\r\nquite chilled through and exhausted, and, when the cattle finally came,\r\nso near frozen that to move was an agony. And then suddenly the place\r\nwould spring into activity, and the merciless \xe2\x80\x9cspeeding-up\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nbegin!\r\n\r\nThere were weeks at a time when Jurgis went home after such a day as\r\nthis with not more than two hours\xe2\x80\x99 work to his credit\xe2\x80\x94which meant about\r\nthirty-five cents. There were many days when the total was less than\r\nhalf an hour, and others when there was none at all. The general\r\naverage was six hours a day, which meant for Jurgis about six dollars a\r\nweek; and this six hours of work would be done after standing on the\r\nkilling bed till one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, or perhaps even three or four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in\r\nthe afternoon. Like as not there would come a rush of cattle at the\r\nvery end of the day, which the men would have to dispose of before they\r\nwent home, often working by electric light till nine or ten, or even\r\ntwelve or one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and without a single instant for a bite of\r\nsupper. The men were at the mercy of the cattle. Perhaps the buyers\r\nwould be holding off for better prices\xe2\x80\x94if they could scare the shippers\r\ninto thinking that they meant to buy nothing that day, they could get\r\ntheir own terms. For some reason the cost of fodder for cattle in the\r\nyards was much above the market price\xe2\x80\x94and you were not allowed to bring\r\nyour own fodder! Then, too, a number of cars were apt to arrive late in\r\nthe day, now that the roads were blocked with snow, and the packers\r\nwould buy their cattle that night, to get them cheaper, and then would\r\ncome into play their ironclad rule, that all cattle must be killed the\r\nsame day they were bought. There was no use kicking about this\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nhad been one delegation after another to see the packers about it, only\r\nto be told that it was the rule, and that there was not the slightest\r\nchance of its ever being altered. And so on Christmas Eve Jurgis worked\r\ntill nearly one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and on Christmas Day he was on\r\nthe killing bed at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nAll this was bad; and yet it was not the worst. For after all the hard\r\nwork a man did, he was paid for only part of it. Jurgis had once been\r\namong those who scoffed at the idea of these huge concerns cheating;\r\nand so now he could appreciate the bitter irony of the fact that it was\r\nprecisely their size which enabled them to do it with impunity. One of\r\nthe rules on the killing beds was that a man who was one minute late\r\nwas docked an hour; and this was economical, for he was made to work\r\nthe balance of the hour\xe2\x80\x94he was not allowed to stand round and wait. And\r\non the other hand if he came ahead of time he got no pay for\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94though often the bosses would start up the gang ten or fifteen\r\nminutes before the whistle. And this same custom they carried over to\r\nthe end of the day; they did not pay for any fraction of an hour\xe2\x80\x94for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbroken time.\xe2\x80\x9d A man might work full fifty minutes, but if there was no\r\nwork to fill out the hour, there was no pay for him. Thus the end of\r\nevery day was a sort of lottery\xe2\x80\x94a struggle, all but breaking into open\r\nwar between the bosses and the men, the former trying to rush a job\r\nthrough and the latter trying to stretch it out. Jurgis blamed the\r\nbosses for this, though the truth to be told it was not always their\r\nfault; for the packers kept them frightened for their lives\xe2\x80\x94and when\r\none was in danger of falling behind the standard, what was easier than\r\nto catch up by making the gang work awhile \xe2\x80\x9cfor the church\xe2\x80\x9d? This was a\r\nsavage witticism the men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to\r\nhim. Old man Jones was great on missions and such things, and so\r\nwhenever they were doing some particularly disreputable job, the men\r\nwould wink at each other and say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re working for the church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of all these things was that Jurgis was no\r\nlonger perplexed when he heard men talk of fighting for their rights.\r\nHe felt like fighting now himself; and when the Irish delegate of the\r\nbutcher-helpers\xe2\x80\x99 union came to him a second time, he received him in a\r\nfar different spirit. A wonderful idea it now seemed to Jurgis, this of\r\nthe men\xe2\x80\x94that by combining they might be able to make a stand and\r\nconquer the packers! Jurgis wondered who had first thought of it; and\r\nwhen he was told that it was a common thing for men to do in America,\r\nhe got the first inkling of a meaning in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ca free country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe delegate explained to him how it depended upon their being able to\r\nget every man to join and stand by the organization, and so Jurgis\r\nsignified that he was willing to do his share. Before another month was\r\nby, all the working members of his family had union cards, and wore\r\ntheir union buttons conspicuously and with pride. For fully a week they\r\nwere quite blissfully happy, thinking that belonging to a union meant\r\nan end to all their troubles.\r\n\r\nBut only ten days after she had joined, Marija\xe2\x80\x99s canning factory closed\r\ndown, and that blow quite staggered them. They could not understand why\r\nthe union had not prevented it, and the very first time she attended a\r\nmeeting Marija got up and made a speech about it. It was a business\r\nmeeting, and was transacted in English, but that made no difference to\r\nMarija; she said what was in her, and all the pounding of the\r\nchairman\xe2\x80\x99s gavel and all the uproar and confusion in the room could not\r\nprevail. Quite apart from her own troubles she was boiling over with a\r\ngeneral sense of the injustice of it, and she told what she thought of\r\nthe packers, and what she thought of a world where such things were\r\nallowed to happen; and then, while the echoes of the hall rang with the\r\nshock of her terrible voice, she sat down again and fanned herself, and\r\nthe meeting gathered itself together and proceeded to discuss the\r\nelection of a recording secretary.\r\n\r\nJurgis too had an adventure the first time he attended a union meeting,\r\nbut it was not of his own seeking. Jurgis had gone with the desire to\r\nget into an inconspicuous corner and see what was done; but this\r\nattitude of silent and open-eyed attention had marked him out for a\r\nvictim. Tommy Finnegan was a little Irishman, with big staring eyes and\r\na wild aspect, a \xe2\x80\x9choister\xe2\x80\x9d by trade, and badly cracked. Somewhere back\r\nin the far-distant past Tommy Finnegan had had a strange experience,\r\nand the burden of it rested upon him. All the balance of his life he\r\nhad done nothing but try to make it understood. When he talked he\r\ncaught his victim by the buttonhole, and his face kept coming closer\r\nand closer\xe2\x80\x94which was trying, because his teeth were so bad. Jurgis did\r\nnot mind that, only he was frightened. The method of operation of the\r\nhigher intelligences was Tom Finnegan\xe2\x80\x99s theme, and he desired to find\r\nout if Jurgis had ever considered that the representation of things in\r\ntheir present similarity might be altogether unintelligible upon a more\r\nelevated plane. There were assuredly wonderful mysteries about the\r\ndeveloping of these things; and then, becoming confidential, Mr.\r\nFinnegan proceeded to tell of some discoveries of his own. \xe2\x80\x9cIf ye have\r\niver had onything to do wid shperrits,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and looked inquiringly\r\nat Jurgis, who kept shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNiver mind, niver mind,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the other, \xe2\x80\x9cbut their influences may be operatin\xe2\x80\x99 upon ye;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s shure as I\xe2\x80\x99m tellin\xe2\x80\x99 ye, it\xe2\x80\x99s them that has the reference to the\r\nimmejit surroundin\xe2\x80\x99s that has the most of power. It was vouchsafed to\r\nme in me youthful days to be acquainted with shperrits\xe2\x80\x9d and so Tommy\r\nFinnegan went on, expounding a system of philosophy, while the\r\nperspiration came out on Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 forehead, so great was his agitation\r\nand embarrassment. In the end one of the men, seeing his plight, came\r\nover and rescued him; but it was some time before he was able to find\r\nany one to explain things to him, and meanwhile his fear lest the\r\nstrange little Irishman should get him cornered again was enough to\r\nkeep him dodging about the room the whole evening.\r\n\r\nHe never missed a meeting, however. He had picked up a few words of\r\nEnglish by this time, and friends would help him to understand. They\r\nwere often very turbulent meetings, with half a dozen men declaiming at\r\nonce, in as many dialects of English; but the speakers were all\r\ndesperately in earnest, and Jurgis was in earnest too, for he\r\nunderstood that a fight was on, and that it was his fight. Since the\r\ntime of his disillusionment, Jurgis had sworn to trust no man, except\r\nin his own family; but here he discovered that he had brothers in\r\naffliction, and allies. Their one chance for life was in union, and so\r\nthe struggle became a kind of crusade. Jurgis had always been a member\r\nof the church, because it was the right thing to be, but the church had\r\nnever touched him, he left all that for the women. Here, however, was a\r\nnew religion\xe2\x80\x94one that did touch him, that took hold of every fiber of\r\nhim; and with all the zeal and fury of a convert he went out as a\r\nmissionary. There were many nonunion men among the Lithuanians, and\r\nwith these he would labor and wrestle in prayer, trying to show them\r\nthe right. Sometimes they would be obstinate and refuse to see it, and\r\nJurgis, alas, was not always patient! He forgot how he himself had been\r\nblind, a short time ago\xe2\x80\x94after the fashion of all crusaders since the\r\noriginal ones, who set out to spread the gospel of Brotherhood by force\r\nof arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first consequences of the discovery of the union was that\r\nJurgis became desirous of learning English. He wanted to know what was\r\ngoing on at the meetings, and to be able to take part in them, and so\r\nhe began to look about him, and to try to pick up words. The children,\r\nwho were at school, and learning fast, would teach him a few; and a\r\nfriend loaned him a little book that had some in it, and Ona would read\r\nthem to him. Then Jurgis became sorry that he could not read himself;\r\nand later on in the winter, when some one told him that there was a\r\nnight school that was free, he went and enrolled. After that, every\r\nevening that he got home from the yards in time, he would go to the\r\nschool; he would go even if he were in time for only half an hour. They\r\nwere teaching him both to read and to speak English\xe2\x80\x94and they would have\r\ntaught him other things, if only he had had a little time.\r\n\r\nAlso the union made another great difference with him\xe2\x80\x94it made him begin\r\nto pay attention to the country. It was the beginning of democracy with\r\nhim. It was a little state, the union, a miniature republic; its\r\naffairs were every man\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, and every man had a real say about\r\nthem. In other words, in the union Jurgis learned to talk politics. In\r\nthe place where he had come from there had not been any politics\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nRussia one thought of the government as an affliction like the\r\nlightning and the hail. \xe2\x80\x9cDuck, little brother, duck,\xe2\x80\x9d the wise old\r\npeasants would whisper; \xe2\x80\x9ceverything passes away.\xe2\x80\x9d And when Jurgis had\r\nfirst come to America he had supposed that it was the same. He had\r\nheard people say that it was a free country\xe2\x80\x94but what did that mean? He\r\nfound that here, precisely as in Russia, there were rich men who owned\r\neverything; and if one could not find any work, was not the hunger he\r\nbegan to feel the same sort of hunger?\r\n\r\nWhen Jurgis had been working about three weeks at Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, there had\r\ncome to him one noontime a man who was employed as a night watchman,\r\nand who asked him if he would not like to take out naturalization\r\npapers and become a citizen. Jurgis did not know what that meant, but\r\nthe man explained the advantages. In the first place, it would not cost\r\nhim anything, and it would get him half a day off, with his pay just\r\nthe same; and then when election time came he would be able to vote\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthere was something in that. Jurgis was naturally glad to accept, and\r\nso the night watchman said a few words to the boss, and he was excused\r\nfor the rest of the day. When, later on, he wanted a holiday to get\r\nmarried he could not get it; and as for a holiday with pay just the\r\nsame\xe2\x80\x94what power had wrought that miracle heaven only knew! However, he\r\nwent with the man, who picked up several other newly landed immigrants,\r\nPoles, Lithuanians, and Slovaks, and took them all outside, where stood\r\na great four-horse tallyho coach, with fifteen or twenty men already in\r\nit. It was a fine chance to see the sights of the city, and the party\r\nhad a merry time, with plenty of beer handed up from inside. So they\r\ndrove downtown and stopped before an imposing granite building, in\r\nwhich they interviewed an official, who had the papers all ready, with\r\nonly the names to be filled in. So each man in turn took an oath of\r\nwhich he did not understand a word, and then was presented with a\r\nhandsome ornamented document with a big red seal and the shield of the\r\nUnited States upon it, and was told that he had become a citizen of the\r\nRepublic and the equal of the President himself.\r\n\r\nA month or two later Jurgis had another interview with this same man,\r\nwho told him where to go to \xe2\x80\x9cregister.\xe2\x80\x9d And then finally, when election\r\nday came, the packing houses posted a notice that men who desired to\r\nvote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night\r\nwatchman took Jurgis and the rest of his flock into the back room of a\r\nsaloon, and showed each of them where and how to mark a ballot, and\r\nthen gave each two dollars, and took them to the polling place, where\r\nthere was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through\r\nall right. Jurgis felt quite proud of this good luck till he got home\r\nand met Jonas, who had taken the leader aside and whispered to him,\r\noffering to vote three times for four dollars, which offer had been\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nAnd now in the union Jurgis met men who explained all this mystery to\r\nhim; and he learned that America differed from Russia in that its\r\ngovernment existed under the form of a democracy. The officials who\r\nruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there\r\nwere two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the\r\none got the office which bought the most votes. Now and then, the\r\nelection was very close, and that was the time the poor man came in. In\r\nthe stockyards this was only in national and state elections, for in\r\nlocal elections the Democratic Party always carried everything. The\r\nruler of the district was therefore the Democratic boss, a little\r\nIrishman named Mike Scully. Scully held an important party office in\r\nthe state, and bossed even the mayor of the city, it was said; it was\r\nhis boast that he carried the stockyards in his pocket. He was an\r\nenormously rich man\xe2\x80\x94he had a hand in all the big graft in the\r\nneighborhood. It was Scully, for instance, who owned that dump which\r\nJurgis and Ona had seen the first day of their arrival. Not only did he\r\nown the dump, but he owned the brick factory as well, and first he took\r\nout the clay and made it into bricks, and then he had the city bring\r\ngarbage to fill up the hole, so that he could build houses to sell to\r\nthe people. Then, too, he sold the bricks to the city, at his own\r\nprice, and the city came and got them in its own wagons. And also he\r\nowned the other hole near by, where the stagnant water was; and it was\r\nhe who cut the ice and sold it; and what was more, if the men told\r\ntruth, he had not had to pay any taxes for the water, and he had built\r\nthe ice-house out of city lumber, and had not had to pay anything for\r\nthat. The newspapers had got hold of that story, and there had been a\r\nscandal; but Scully had hired somebody to confess and take all the\r\nblame, and then skip the country. It was said, too, that he had built\r\nhis brick-kiln in the same way, and that the workmen were on the city\r\npayroll while they did it; however, one had to press closely to get\r\nthese things out of the men, for it was not their business, and Mike\r\nScully was a good man to stand in with. A note signed by him was equal\r\nto a job any time at the packing houses; and also he employed a good\r\nmany men himself, and worked them only eight hours a day, and paid them\r\nthe highest wages. This gave him many friends\xe2\x80\x94all of whom he had gotten\r\ntogether into the \xe2\x80\x9cWar Whoop League,\xe2\x80\x9d whose clubhouse you might see\r\njust outside of the yards. It was the biggest clubhouse, and the\r\nbiggest club, in all Chicago; and they had prizefights every now and\r\nthen, and cockfights and even dogfights. The policemen in the district\r\nall belonged to the league, and instead of suppressing the fights, they\r\nsold tickets for them. The man that had taken Jurgis to be naturalized\r\nwas one of these \xe2\x80\x9cIndians,\xe2\x80\x9d as they were called; and on election day\r\nthere would be hundreds of them out, and all with big wads of money in\r\ntheir pockets and free drinks at every saloon in the district. That was\r\nanother thing, the men said\xe2\x80\x94all the saloon-keepers had to be \xe2\x80\x9cIndians,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand to put up on demand, otherwise they could not do business on\r\nSundays, nor have any gambling at all. In the same way Scully had all\r\nthe jobs in the fire department at his disposal, and all the rest of\r\nthe city graft in the stockyards district; he was building a block of\r\nflats somewhere up on Ashland Avenue, and the man who was overseeing it\r\nfor him was drawing pay as a city inspector of sewers. The city\r\ninspector of water pipes had been dead and buried for over a year, but\r\nsomebody was still drawing his pay. The city inspector of sidewalks was\r\na barkeeper at the War Whoop Cafe\xe2\x80\x94and maybe he could make it\r\nuncomfortable for any tradesman who did not stand in with Scully!\r\n\r\nEven the packers were in awe of him, so the men said. It gave them\r\npleasure to believe this, for Scully stood as the people\xe2\x80\x99s man, and\r\nboasted of it boldly when election day came. The packers had wanted a\r\nbridge at Ashland Avenue, but they had not been able to get it till\r\nthey had seen Scully; and it was the same with \xe2\x80\x9cBubbly Creek,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nthe city had threatened to make the packers cover over, till Scully had\r\ncome to their aid. \xe2\x80\x9cBubbly Creek\xe2\x80\x9d is an arm of the Chicago River, and\r\nforms the southern boundary of the yards: all the drainage of the\r\nsquare mile of packing houses empties into it, so that it is really a\r\ngreat open sewer a hundred or two feet wide. One long arm of it is\r\nblind, and the filth stays there forever and a day. The grease and\r\nchemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange\r\ntransformations, which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in\r\nmotion, as if huge fish were feeding in it, or great leviathans\r\ndisporting themselves in its depths. Bubbles of carbonic acid gas will\r\nrise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide.\r\nHere and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek\r\nlooks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding, and many\r\ntimes an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished\r\ntemporarily. The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every\r\nnow and then the surface would catch on fire and burn furiously, and\r\nthe fire department would have to come and put it out. Once, however,\r\nan ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows,\r\nto make lard out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an\r\ninjunction to stop him, and afterward gathered it themselves. The banks\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cBubbly Creek\xe2\x80\x9d are plastered thick with hairs, and this also the\r\npackers gather and clean.\r\n\r\nAnd there were things even stranger than this, according to the gossip\r\nof the men. The packers had secret mains, through which they stole\r\nbillions of gallons of the city\xe2\x80\x99s water. The newspapers had been full\r\nof this scandal\xe2\x80\x94once there had even been an investigation, and an\r\nactual uncovering of the pipes; but nobody had been punished, and the\r\nthing went right on. And then there was the condemned meat industry,\r\nwith its endless horrors. The people of Chicago saw the government\r\ninspectors in Packingtown, and they all took that to mean that they\r\nwere protected from diseased meat; they did not understand that these\r\nhundred and sixty-three inspectors had been appointed at the request of\r\nthe packers, and that they were paid by the United States government to\r\ncertify that all the diseased meat was kept in the state. They had no\r\nauthority beyond that; for the inspection of meat to be sold in the\r\ncity and state the whole force in Packingtown consisted of three\r\nhenchmen of the local political machine![2] And shortly afterward one\r\nof these, a physician, made the discovery that the carcasses of steers\r\nwhich had been condemned as tubercular by the government inspectors,\r\nand which therefore contained ptomaines, which are deadly poisons, were\r\nleft upon an open platform and carted away to be sold in the city; and\r\nso he insisted that these carcasses be treated with an injection of\r\nkerosene\xe2\x80\x94and was ordered to resign the same week! So indignant were the\r\npackers that they went farther, and compelled the mayor to abolish the\r\nwhole bureau of inspection; so that since then there has not been even\r\na pretense of any interference with the graft. There was said to be two\r\nthousand dollars a week hush money from the tubercular steers alone;\r\nand as much again from the hogs which had died of cholera on the\r\ntrains, and which you might see any day being loaded into boxcars and\r\nhauled away to a place called Globe, in Indiana, where they made a\r\nfancy grade of lard.\r\n\r\n [2] Rules and Regulations for the Inspection of Livestock and Their\r\n Products. United States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal\r\n Industries, Order No. 125:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Section 1. Proprietors of slaughterhouses, canning, salting,\r\n    packing, or rendering establishments engaged in the slaughtering of\r\n    cattle, sheep, or swine, or the packing of any of their products,\r\n    _the carcasses or products of which are to become subjects of\r\n    interstate or foreign commerce_, shall make application to the\r\n    Secretary of Agriculture for inspection of said animals and their\r\n    products....\r\n    Section 15. Such rejected or condemned animals shall at once be\r\n    removed by the owners from the pens containing animals which have\r\n    been inspected and found to be free from disease and fit for human\r\n    food, and _shall be disposed of in accordance with the laws,\r\n    ordinances, and regulations of the state and municipality in which\r\n    said rejected or condemned animals are located_....\r\n\r\n    Section 25. A microscopic examination for trichinae shall be made\r\n    of all swine products exported to countries requiring such\r\n    examination. _No microscopic examination will be made of hogs\r\n    slaughtered for interstate trade, but this examination shall be\r\n    confined to those intended for the export trade._\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis heard of these things little by little, in the gossip of those\r\nwho were obliged to perpetrate them. It seemed as if every time you met\r\na person from a new department, you heard of new swindles and new\r\ncrimes. There was, for instance, a Lithuanian who was a cattle butcher\r\nfor the plant where Marija had worked, which killed meat for canning\r\nonly; and to hear this man describe the animals which came to his place\r\nwould have been worthwhile for a Dante or a Zola. It seemed that they\r\nmust have agencies all over the country, to hunt out old and crippled\r\nand diseased cattle to be canned. There were cattle which had been fed\r\non \xe2\x80\x9cwhisky-malt,\xe2\x80\x9d the refuse of the breweries, and had become what the\r\nmen called \xe2\x80\x9csteerly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which means covered with boils. It was a nasty job\r\nkilling these, for when you plunged your knife into them they would\r\nburst and splash foul-smelling stuff into your face; and when a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsleeves were smeared with blood, and his hands steeped in it, how was\r\nhe ever to wipe his face, or to clear his eyes so that he could see? It\r\nwas stuff such as this that made the \xe2\x80\x9cembalmed beef\xe2\x80\x9d that had killed\r\nseveral times as many United States soldiers as all the bullets of the\r\nSpaniards; only the army beef, besides, was not fresh canned, it was\r\nold stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars.\r\n\r\nThen one Sunday evening, Jurgis sat puffing his pipe by the kitchen\r\nstove, and talking with an old fellow whom Jonas had introduced, and\r\nwho worked in the canning rooms at Durham\xe2\x80\x99s; and so Jurgis learned a\r\nfew things about the great and only Durham canned goods, which had\r\nbecome a national institution. They were regular alchemists at\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s; they advertised a mushroom-catsup, and the men who made it\r\ndid not know what a mushroom looked like. They advertised \xe2\x80\x9cpotted\r\nchicken,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and it was like the boardinghouse soup of the comic papers,\r\nthrough which a chicken had walked with rubbers on. Perhaps they had a\r\nsecret process for making chickens chemically\xe2\x80\x94who knows? said Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfriend; the things that went into the mixture were tripe, and the fat\r\nof pork, and beef suet, and hearts of beef, and finally the waste ends\r\nof veal, when they had any. They put these up in several grades, and\r\nsold them at several prices; but the contents of the cans all came out\r\nof the same hopper. And then there was \xe2\x80\x9cpotted game\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpotted\r\ngrouse,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpotted ham,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdeviled ham\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94de-vyled, as the men called\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cDe-vyled\xe2\x80\x9d ham was made out of the waste ends of smoked beef that\r\nwere too small to be sliced by the machines; and also tripe, dyed with\r\nchemicals so that it would not show white; and trimmings of hams and\r\ncorned beef; and potatoes, skins and all; and finally the hard\r\ncartilaginous gullets of beef, after the tongues had been cut out. All\r\nthis ingenious mixture was ground up and flavored with spices to make\r\nit taste like something. Anybody who could invent a new imitation had\r\nbeen sure of a fortune from old Durham, said Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 informant; but it\r\nwas hard to think of anything new in a place where so many sharp wits\r\nhad been at work for so long; where men welcomed tuberculosis in the\r\ncattle they were feeding, because it made them fatten more quickly; and\r\nwhere they bought up all the old rancid butter left over in the grocery\r\nstores of a continent, and \xe2\x80\x9coxidized\xe2\x80\x9d it by a forced-air process, to\r\ntake away the odor, rechurned it with skim milk, and sold it in bricks\r\nin the cities! Up to a year or two ago it had been the custom to kill\r\nhorses in the yards\xe2\x80\x94ostensibly for fertilizer; but after long agitation\r\nthe newspapers had been able to make the public realize that the horses\r\nwere being canned. Now it was against the law to kill horses in\r\nPackingtown, and the law was really complied with\xe2\x80\x94for the present, at\r\nany rate. Any day, however, one might see sharp-horned and\r\nshaggy-haired creatures running with the sheep and yet what a job you\r\nwould have to get the public to believe that a good part of what it\r\nbuys for lamb and mutton is really goat\xe2\x80\x99s flesh!\r\n\r\nThere was another interesting set of statistics that a person might\r\nhave gathered in Packingtown\xe2\x80\x94those of the various afflictions of the\r\nworkers. When Jurgis had first inspected the packing plants with\r\nSzedvilas, he had marveled while he listened to the tale of all the\r\nthings that were made out of the carcasses of animals, and of all the\r\nlesser industries that were maintained there; now he found that each\r\none of these lesser industries was a separate little inferno, in its\r\nway as horrible as the killing beds, the source and fountain of them\r\nall. The workers in each of them had their own peculiar diseases. And\r\nthe wandering visitor might be skeptical about all the swindles, but he\r\ncould not be skeptical about these, for the worker bore the evidence of\r\nthem about on his own person\xe2\x80\x94generally he had only to hold out his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThere were the men in the pickle rooms, for instance, where old Antanas\r\nhad gotten his death; scarce a one of these that had not some spot of\r\nhorror on his person. Let a man so much as scrape his finger pushing a\r\ntruck in the pickle rooms, and he might have a sore that would put him\r\nout of the world; all the joints in his fingers might be eaten by the\r\nacid, one by one. Of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and\r\ntrimmers, and all those who used knives, you could scarcely find a\r\nperson who had the use of his thumb; time and time again the base of it\r\nhad been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the\r\nman pressed the knife to hold it. The hands of these men would be\r\ncriss-crossed with cuts, until you could no longer pretend to count\r\nthem or to trace them. They would have no nails,\xe2\x80\x94they had worn them off\r\npulling hides; their knuckles were swollen so that their fingers spread\r\nout like a fan. There were men who worked in the cooking rooms, in the\r\nmidst of steam and sickening odors, by artificial light; in these rooms\r\nthe germs of tuberculosis might live for two years, but the supply was\r\nrenewed every hour. There were the beef-luggers, who carried\r\ntwo-hundred-pound quarters into the refrigerator-cars; a fearful kind\r\nof work, that began at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and that wore out\r\nthe most powerful men in a few years. There were those who worked in\r\nthe chilling rooms, and whose special disease was rheumatism; the time\r\nlimit that a man could work in the chilling rooms was said to be five\r\nyears. There were the wool-pluckers, whose hands went to pieces even\r\nsooner than the hands of the pickle men; for the pelts of the sheep had\r\nto be painted with acid to loosen the wool, and then the pluckers had\r\nto pull out this wool with their bare hands, till the acid had eaten\r\ntheir fingers off. There were those who made the tins for the canned\r\nmeat; and their hands, too, were a maze of cuts, and each cut\r\nrepresented a chance for blood poisoning. Some worked at the stamping\r\nmachines, and it was very seldom that one could work long there at the\r\npace that was set, and not give out and forget himself and have a part\r\nof his hand chopped off. There were the \xe2\x80\x9choisters,\xe2\x80\x9d as they were\r\ncalled, whose task it was to press the lever which lifted the dead\r\ncattle off the floor. They ran along upon a rafter, peering down\r\nthrough the damp and the steam; and as old Durham\xe2\x80\x99s architects had not\r\nbuilt the killing room for the convenience of the hoisters, at every\r\nfew feet they would have to stoop under a beam, say four feet above the\r\none they ran on; which got them into the habit of stooping, so that in\r\na few years they would be walking like chimpanzees. Worst of any,\r\nhowever, were the fertilizer men, and those who served in the cooking\r\nrooms. These people could not be shown to the visitor,\xe2\x80\x94for the odor of\r\na fertilizer man would scare any ordinary visitor at a hundred yards,\r\nand as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full of steam, and\r\nin some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor,\r\ntheir peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they\r\nwere fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth\r\nexhibiting,\xe2\x80\x94sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all but\r\nthe bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham\xe2\x80\x99s Pure Leaf Lard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the winter the family had had money enough to\r\nlive and a little over to pay their debts with; but when the earnings\r\nof Jurgis fell from nine or ten dollars a week to five or six, there\r\nwas no longer anything to spare. The winter went, and the spring came,\r\nand found them still living thus from hand to mouth, hanging on day by\r\nday, with literally not a month\xe2\x80\x99s wages between them and starvation.\r\nMarija was in despair, for there was still no word about the reopening\r\nof the canning factory, and her savings were almost entirely gone. She\r\nhad had to give up all idea of marrying then; the family could not get\r\nalong without her\xe2\x80\x94though for that matter she was likely soon to become\r\na burden even upon them, for when her money was all gone, they would\r\nhave to pay back what they owed her in board. So Jurgis and Ona and\r\nTeta Elzbieta would hold anxious conferences until late at night,\r\ntrying to figure how they could manage this too without starving.\r\n\r\nSuch were the cruel terms upon which their life was possible, that they\r\nmight never have nor expect a single instant\xe2\x80\x99s respite from worry, a\r\nsingle instant in which they were not haunted by the thought of money.\r\nThey would no sooner escape, as by a miracle, from one difficulty, than\r\na new one would come into view. In addition to all their physical\r\nhardships, there was thus a constant strain upon their minds; they were\r\nharried all day and nearly all night by worry and fear. This was in\r\ntruth not living; it was scarcely even existing, and they felt that it\r\nwas too little for the price they paid. They were willing to work all\r\nthe time; and when people did their best, ought they not to be able to\r\nkeep alive?\r\n\r\nThere seemed never to be an end to the things they had to buy and to\r\nthe unforeseen contingencies. Once their water pipes froze and burst;\r\nand when, in their ignorance, they thawed them out, they had a\r\nterrifying flood in their house. It happened while the men were away,\r\nand poor Elzbieta rushed out into the street screaming for help, for\r\nshe did not even know whether the flood could be stopped, or whether\r\nthey were ruined for life. It was nearly as bad as the latter, they\r\nfound in the end, for the plumber charged them seventy-five cents an\r\nhour, and seventy-five cents for another man who had stood and watched\r\nhim, and included all the time the two had been going and coming, and\r\nalso a charge for all sorts of material and extras. And then again,\r\nwhen they went to pay their January\xe2\x80\x99s installment on the house, the\r\nagent terrified them by asking them if they had had the insurance\r\nattended to yet. In answer to their inquiry he showed them a clause in\r\nthe deed which provided that they were to keep the house insured for\r\none thousand dollars, as soon as the present policy ran out, which\r\nwould happen in a few days. Poor Elzbieta, upon whom again fell the\r\nblow, demanded how much it would cost them. Seven dollars, the man\r\nsaid; and that night came Jurgis, grim and determined, requesting that\r\nthe agent would be good enough to inform him, once for all, as to all\r\nthe expenses they were liable for. The deed was signed now, he said,\r\nwith sarcasm proper to the new way of life he had learned\xe2\x80\x94the deed was\r\nsigned, and so the agent had no longer anything to gain by keeping\r\nquiet. And Jurgis looked the fellow squarely in the eye, and so the\r\nfellow wasted no time in conventional protests, but read him the deed.\r\nThey would have to renew the insurance every year; they would have to\r\npay the taxes, about ten dollars a year; they would have to pay the\r\nwater tax, about six dollars a year\xe2\x80\x94(Jurgis silently resolved to shut\r\noff the hydrant). This, besides the interest and the monthly\r\ninstallments, would be all\xe2\x80\x94unless by chance the city should happen to\r\ndecide to put in a sewer or to lay a sidewalk. Yes, said the agent,\r\nthey would have to have these, whether they wanted them or not, if the\r\ncity said so. The sewer would cost them about twenty-two dollars, and\r\nthe sidewalk fifteen if it were wood, twenty-five if it were cement.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went home again; it was a relief to know the worst, at any\r\nrate, so that he could no more be surprised by fresh demands. He saw\r\nnow how they had been plundered; but they were in for it, there was no\r\nturning back. They could only go on and make the fight and win\xe2\x80\x94for\r\ndefeat was a thing that could not even be thought of.\r\n\r\nWhen the springtime came, they were delivered from the dreadful cold,\r\nand that was a great deal; but in addition they had counted on the\r\nmoney they would not have to pay for coal\xe2\x80\x94and it was just at this time\r\nthat Marija\xe2\x80\x99s board began to fail. Then, too, the warm weather brought\r\ntrials of its own; each season had its trials, as they found. In the\r\nspring there were cold rains, that turned the streets into canals and\r\nbogs; the mud would be so deep that wagons would sink up to the hubs,\r\nso that half a dozen horses could not move them. Then, of course, it\r\nwas impossible for any one to get to work with dry feet; and this was\r\nbad for men that were poorly clad and shod, and still worse for women\r\nand children. Later came midsummer, with the stifling heat, when the\r\ndingy killing beds of Durham\xe2\x80\x99s became a very purgatory; one time, in a\r\nsingle day, three men fell dead from sunstroke. All day long the rivers\r\nof hot blood poured forth, until, with the sun beating down, and the\r\nair motionless, the stench was enough to knock a man over; all the old\r\nsmells of a generation would be drawn out by this heat\xe2\x80\x94for there was\r\nnever any washing of the walls and rafters and pillars, and they were\r\ncaked with the filth of a lifetime. The men who worked on the killing\r\nbeds would come to reek with foulness, so that you could smell one of\r\nthem fifty feet away; there was simply no such thing as keeping decent,\r\nthe most careful man gave it up in the end, and wallowed in\r\nuncleanness. There was not even a place where a man could wash his\r\nhands, and the men ate as much raw blood as food at dinnertime. When\r\nthey were at work they could not even wipe off their faces\xe2\x80\x94they were as\r\nhelpless as newly born babes in that respect; and it may seem like a\r\nsmall matter, but when the sweat began to run down their necks and\r\ntickle them, or a fly to bother them, it was a torture like being\r\nburned alive. Whether it was the slaughterhouses or the dumps that were\r\nresponsible, one could not say, but with the hot weather there\r\ndescended upon Packingtown a veritable Egyptian plague of flies; there\r\ncould be no describing this\xe2\x80\x94the houses would be black with them. There\r\nwas no escaping; you might provide all your doors and windows with\r\nscreens, but their buzzing outside would be like the swarming of bees,\r\nand whenever you opened the door they would rush in as if a storm of\r\nwind were driving them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions\r\nof green fields and mountains and sparkling lakes. It had no such\r\nsuggestion for the people in the yards. The great packing machine\r\nground on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields; and the men\r\nand women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing,\r\nnot even a flower. Four or five miles to the east of them lay the blue\r\nwaters of Lake Michigan; but for all the good it did them it might have\r\nbeen as far away as the Pacific Ocean. They had only Sundays, and then\r\nthey were too tired to walk. They were tied to the great packing\r\nmachine, and tied to it for life. The managers and superintendents and\r\nclerks of Packingtown were all recruited from another class, and never\r\nfrom the workers; they scorned the workers, the very meanest of them. A\r\npoor devil of a bookkeeper who had been working in Durham\xe2\x80\x99s for twenty\r\nyears at a salary of six dollars a week, and might work there for\r\ntwenty more and do no better, would yet consider himself a gentleman,\r\nas far removed as the poles from the most skilled worker on the killing\r\nbeds; he would dress differently, and live in another part of the town,\r\nand come to work at a different hour of the day, and in every way make\r\nsure that he never rubbed elbows with a laboring man. Perhaps this was\r\ndue to the repulsiveness of the work; at any rate, the people who\r\nworked with their hands were a class apart, and were made to feel it.\r\n\r\nIn the late spring the canning factory started up again, and so once\r\nmore Marija was heard to sing, and the love-music of Tamoszius took on\r\na less melancholy tone. It was not for long, however; for a month or\r\ntwo later a dreadful calamity fell upon Marija. Just one year and three\r\ndays after she had begun work as a can-painter, she lost her job.\r\n\r\nIt was a long story. Marija insisted that it was because of her\r\nactivity in the union. The packers, of course, had spies in all the\r\nunions, and in addition they made a practice of buying up a certain\r\nnumber of the union officials, as many as they thought they needed. So\r\nevery week they received reports as to what was going on, and often\r\nthey knew things before the members of the union knew them. Any one who\r\nwas considered to be dangerous by them would find that he was not a\r\nfavorite with his boss; and Marija had been a great hand for going\r\nafter the foreign people and preaching to them. However that might be,\r\nthe known facts were that a few weeks before the factory closed, Marija\r\nhad been cheated out of her pay for three hundred cans. The girls\r\nworked at a long table, and behind them walked a woman with pencil and\r\nnotebook, keeping count of the number they finished. This woman was, of\r\ncourse, only human, and sometimes made mistakes; when this happened,\r\nthere was no redress\xe2\x80\x94if on Saturday you got less money than you had\r\nearned, you had to make the best of it. But Marija did not understand\r\nthis, and made a disturbance. Marija\xe2\x80\x99s disturbances did not mean\r\nanything, and while she had known only Lithuanian and Polish, they had\r\ndone no harm, for people only laughed at her and made her cry. But now\r\nMarija was able to call names in English, and so she got the woman who\r\nmade the mistake to disliking her. Probably, as Marija claimed, she\r\nmade mistakes on purpose after that; at any rate, she made them, and\r\nthe third time it happened Marija went on the warpath and took the\r\nmatter first to the forelady, and when she got no satisfaction there,\r\nto the superintendent. This was unheard-of presumption, but the\r\nsuperintendent said he would see about it, which Marija took to mean\r\nthat she was going to get her money; after waiting three days, she went\r\nto see the superintendent again. This time the man frowned, and said\r\nthat he had not had time to attend to it; and when Marija, against the\r\nadvice and warning of every one, tried it once more, he ordered her\r\nback to her work in a passion. Just how things happened after that\r\nMarija was not sure, but that afternoon the forelady told her that her\r\nservices would not be any longer required. Poor Marija could not have\r\nbeen more dumfounded had the woman knocked her over the head; at first\r\nshe could not believe what she heard, and then she grew furious and\r\nswore that she would come anyway, that her place belonged to her. In\r\nthe end she sat down in the middle of the floor and wept and wailed.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel lesson; but then Marija was headstrong\xe2\x80\x94she should have\r\nlistened to those who had had experience. The next time she would know\r\nher place, as the forelady expressed it; and so Marija went out, and\r\nthe family faced the problem of an existence again.\r\n\r\nIt was especially hard this time, for Ona was to be confined before\r\nlong, and Jurgis was trying hard to save up money for this. He had\r\nheard dreadful stories of the midwives, who grow as thick as fleas in\r\nPackingtown; and he had made up his mind that Ona must have a\r\nman-doctor. Jurgis could be very obstinate when he wanted to, and he\r\nwas in this case, much to the dismay of the women, who felt that a\r\nman-doctor was an impropriety, and that the matter really belonged to\r\nthem. The cheapest doctor they could find would charge them fifteen\r\ndollars, and perhaps more when the bill came in; and here was Jurgis,\r\ndeclaring that he would pay it, even if he had to stop eating in the\r\nmeantime!\r\n\r\nMarija had only about twenty-five dollars left. Day after day she\r\nwandered about the yards begging a job, but this time without hope of\r\nfinding it. Marija could do the work of an able-bodied man, when she\r\nwas cheerful, but discouragement wore her out easily, and she would\r\ncome home at night a pitiable object. She learned her lesson this time,\r\npoor creature; she learned it ten times over. All the family learned it\r\nalong with her\xe2\x80\x94that when you have once got a job in Packingtown, you\r\nhang on to it, come what will.\r\n\r\nFour weeks Marija hunted, and half of a fifth week. Of course she\r\nstopped paying her dues to the union. She lost all interest in the\r\nunion, and cursed herself for a fool that she had ever been dragged\r\ninto one. She had about made up her mind that she was a lost soul, when\r\nsomebody told her of an opening, and she went and got a place as a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbeef-trimmer.\xe2\x80\x9d She got this because the boss saw that she had the\r\nmuscles of a man, and so he discharged a man and put Marija to do his\r\nwork, paying her a little more than half what he had been paying\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhen she first came to Packingtown, Marija would have scorned such work\r\nas this. She was in another canning factory, and her work was to trim\r\nthe meat of those diseased cattle that Jurgis had been told about not\r\nlong before. She was shut up in one of the rooms where the people\r\nseldom saw the daylight; beneath her were the chilling rooms, where the\r\nmeat was frozen, and above her were the cooking rooms; and so she stood\r\non an ice-cold floor, while her head was often so hot that she could\r\nscarcely breathe. Trimming beef off the bones by the hundred-weight,\r\nwhile standing up from early morning till late at night, with heavy\r\nboots on and the floor always damp and full of puddles, liable to be\r\nthrown out of work indefinitely because of a slackening in the trade,\r\nliable again to be kept overtime in rush seasons, and be worked till\r\nshe trembled in every nerve and lost her grip on her slimy knife, and\r\ngave herself a poisoned wound\xe2\x80\x94that was the new life that unfolded\r\nitself before Marija. But because Marija was a human horse she merely\r\nlaughed and went at it; it would enable her to pay her board again, and\r\nkeep the family going. And as for Tamoszius\xe2\x80\x94well, they had waited a\r\nlong time, and they could wait a little longer. They could not possibly\r\nget along upon his wages alone, and the family could not live without\r\nhers. He could come and visit her, and sit in the kitchen and hold her\r\nhand, and he must manage to be content with that. But day by day the\r\nmusic of Tamoszius\xe2\x80\x99 violin became more passionate and heartbreaking;\r\nand Marija would sit with her hands clasped and her cheeks wet and all\r\nher body a-tremble, hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the\r\nunborn generations which cried out in her for life.\r\n\r\nMarija\xe2\x80\x99s lesson came just in time to save Ona from a similar fate. Ona,\r\ntoo, was dissatisfied with her place, and had far more reason than\r\nMarija. She did not tell half of her story at home, because she saw it\r\nwas a torment to Jurgis, and she was afraid of what he might do. For a\r\nlong time Ona had seen that Miss Henderson, the forelady in her\r\ndepartment, did not like her. At first she thought it was the old-time\r\nmistake she had made in asking for a holiday to get married. Then she\r\nconcluded it must be because she did not give the forelady a present\r\noccasionally\xe2\x80\x94she was the kind that took presents from the girls, Ona\r\nlearned, and made all sorts of discriminations in favor of those who\r\ngave them. In the end, however, Ona discovered that it was even worse\r\nthan that. Miss Henderson was a newcomer, and it was some time before\r\nrumor made her out; but finally it transpired that she was a kept\r\nwoman, the former mistress of the superintendent of a department in the\r\nsame building. He had put her there to keep her quiet, it seemed\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat not altogether with success, for once or twice they had been heard\r\nquarreling. She had the temper of a hyena, and soon the place she ran\r\nwas a witch\xe2\x80\x99s caldron. There were some of the girls who were of her own\r\nsort, who were willing to toady to her and flatter her; and these would\r\ncarry tales about the rest, and so the furies were unchained in the\r\nplace. Worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdy-house downtown, with\r\na coarse, red-faced Irishman named Connor, who was the boss of the\r\nloading-gang outside, and would make free with the girls as they went\r\nto and from their work. In the slack seasons some of them would go with\r\nMiss Henderson to this house downtown\xe2\x80\x94in fact, it would not be too much\r\nto say that she managed her department at Brown\xe2\x80\x99s in conjunction with\r\nit. Sometimes women from the house would be given places alongside of\r\ndecent girls, and after other decent girls had been turned off to make\r\nroom for them. When you worked in this woman\xe2\x80\x99s department the house\r\ndowntown was never out of your thoughts all day\xe2\x80\x94there were always\r\nwhiffs of it to be caught, like the odor of the Packingtown rendering\r\nplants at night, when the wind shifted suddenly. There would be stories\r\nabout it going the rounds; the girls opposite you would be telling them\r\nand winking at you. In such a place Ona would not have stayed a day,\r\nbut for starvation; and, as it was, she was never sure that she could\r\nstay the next day. She understood now that the real reason that Miss\r\nHenderson hated her was that she was a decent married girl; and she\r\nknew that the talebearers and the toadies hated her for the same\r\nreason, and were doing their best to make her life miserable.\r\n\r\nBut there was no place a girl could go in Packingtown, if she was\r\nparticular about things of this sort; there was no place in it where a\r\nprostitute could not get along better than a decent girl. Here was a\r\npopulation, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge\r\nof starvation, and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the\r\nwhim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave\r\ndrivers; under such circumstances immorality was exactly as inevitable,\r\nand as prevalent, as it was under the system of chattel slavery. Things\r\nthat were quite unspeakable went on there in the packing houses all the\r\ntime, and were taken for granted by everybody; only they did not show,\r\nas in the old slavery times, because there was no difference in color\r\nbetween master and slave.\r\n\r\nOne morning Ona stayed home, and Jurgis had the man-doctor, according\r\nto his whim, and she was safely delivered of a fine baby. It was an\r\nenormous big boy, and Ona was such a tiny creature herself, that it\r\nseemed quite incredible. Jurgis would stand and gaze at the stranger by\r\nthe hour, unable to believe that it had really happened.\r\n\r\nThe coming of this boy was a decisive event with Jurgis. It made him\r\nirrevocably a family man; it killed the last lingering impulse that he\r\nmight have had to go out in the evenings and sit and talk with the men\r\nin the saloons. There was nothing he cared for now so much as to sit\r\nand look at the baby. This was very curious, for Jurgis had never been\r\ninterested in babies before. But then, this was a very unusual sort of\r\na baby. He had the brightest little black eyes, and little black\r\nringlets all over his head; he was the living image of his father,\r\neverybody said\xe2\x80\x94and Jurgis found this a fascinating circumstance. It was\r\nsufficiently perplexing that this tiny mite of life should have come\r\ninto the world at all in the manner that it had; that it should have\r\ncome with a comical imitation of its father\xe2\x80\x99s nose was simply uncanny.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, Jurgis thought, this was intended to signify that it was his\r\nbaby; that it was his and Ona\xe2\x80\x99s, to care for all its life. Jurgis had\r\nnever possessed anything nearly so interesting\xe2\x80\x94a baby was, when you\r\ncame to think about it, assuredly a marvelous possession. It would grow\r\nup to be a man, a human soul, with a personality all its own, a will of\r\nits own! Such thoughts would keep haunting Jurgis, filling him with all\r\nsorts of strange and almost painful excitements. He was wonderfully\r\nproud of little Antanas; he was curious about all the details of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94the washing and the dressing and the eating and the sleeping of\r\nhim, and asked all sorts of absurd questions. It took him quite a while\r\nto get over his alarm at the incredible shortness of the little\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\nJurgis had, alas, very little time to see his baby; he never felt the\r\nchains about him more than just then. When he came home at night, the\r\nbaby would be asleep, and it would be the merest chance if he awoke\r\nbefore Jurgis had to go to sleep himself. Then in the morning there was\r\nno time to look at him, so really the only chance the father had was on\r\nSundays. This was more cruel yet for Ona, who ought to have stayed home\r\nand nursed him, the doctor said, for her own health as well as the\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s; but Ona had to go to work, and leave him for Teta Elzbieta to\r\nfeed upon the pale blue poison that was called milk at the corner\r\ngrocery. Ona\xe2\x80\x99s confinement lost her only a week\xe2\x80\x99s wages\xe2\x80\x94she would go to\r\nthe factory the second Monday, and the best that Jurgis could persuade\r\nher was to ride in the car, and let him run along behind and help her\r\nto Brown\xe2\x80\x99s when she alighted. After that it would be all right, said\r\nOna, it was no strain sitting still sewing hams all day; and if she\r\nwaited longer she might find that her dreadful forelady had put some\r\none else in her place. That would be a greater calamity than ever now,\r\nOna continued, on account of the baby. They would all have to work\r\nharder now on his account. It was such a responsibility\xe2\x80\x94they must not\r\nhave the baby grow up to suffer as they had. And this indeed had been\r\nthe first thing that Jurgis had thought of himself\xe2\x80\x94he had clenched his\r\nhands and braced himself anew for the struggle, for the sake of that\r\ntiny mite of human possibility.\r\n\r\nAnd so Ona went back to Brown\xe2\x80\x99s and saved her place and a week\xe2\x80\x99s wages;\r\nand so she gave herself some one of the thousand ailments that women\r\ngroup under the title of \xe2\x80\x9cwomb trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d and was never again a well\r\nperson as long as she lived. It is difficult to convey in words all\r\nthat this meant to Ona; it seemed such a slight offense, and the\r\npunishment was so out of all proportion, that neither she nor any one\r\nelse ever connected the two. \xe2\x80\x9cWomb trouble\xe2\x80\x9d to Ona did not mean a\r\nspecialist\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis, and a course of treatment, and perhaps an\r\noperation or two; it meant simply headaches and pains in the back, and\r\ndepression and heartsickness, and neuralgia when she had to go to work\r\nin the rain. The great majority of the women who worked in Packingtown\r\nsuffered in the same way, and from the same cause, so it was not deemed\r\na thing to see the doctor about; instead Ona would try patent\r\nmedicines, one after another, as her friends told her about them. As\r\nthese all contained alcohol, or some other stimulant, she found that\r\nthey all did her good while she took them; and so she was always\r\nchasing the phantom of good health, and losing it because she was too\r\npoor to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the packing houses were in full activity again, and\r\nJurgis made more money. He did not make so much, however, as he had the\r\nprevious summer, for the packers took on more hands. There were new men\r\nevery week, it seemed\xe2\x80\x94it was a regular system; and this number they\r\nwould keep over to the next slack season, so that every one would have\r\nless than ever. Sooner or later, by this plan, they would have all the\r\nfloating labor of Chicago trained to do their work. And how very\r\ncunning a trick was that! The men were to teach new hands, who would\r\nsome day come and break their strike; and meantime they were kept so\r\npoor that they could not prepare for the trial!\r\n\r\nBut let no one suppose that this superfluity of employees meant easier\r\nwork for any one! On the contrary, the speeding-up seemed to be growing\r\nmore savage all the time; they were continually inventing new devices\r\nto crowd the work on\xe2\x80\x94it was for all the world like the thumbscrew of\r\nthe medi\xc3\xa6val torture chamber. They would get new pacemakers and pay\r\nthem more; they would drive the men on with new machinery\xe2\x80\x94it was said\r\nthat in the hog-killing rooms the speed at which the hogs moved was\r\ndetermined by clockwork, and that it was increased a little every day.\r\nIn piecework they would reduce the time, requiring the same work in a\r\nshorter time, and paying the same wages; and then, after the workers\r\nhad accustomed themselves to this new speed, they would reduce the rate\r\nof payment to correspond with the reduction in time! They had done this\r\nso often in the canning establishments that the girls were fairly\r\ndesperate; their wages had gone down by a full third in the past two\r\nyears, and a storm of discontent was brewing that was likely to break\r\nany day. Only a month after Marija had become a beef-trimmer the\r\ncanning factory that she had left posted a cut that would divide the\r\ngirls\xe2\x80\x99 earnings almost squarely in half; and so great was the\r\nindignation at this that they marched out without even a parley, and\r\norganized in the street outside. One of the girls had read somewhere\r\nthat a red flag was the proper symbol for oppressed workers, and so\r\nthey mounted one, and paraded all about the yards, yelling with rage. A\r\nnew union was the result of this outburst, but the impromptu strike\r\nwent to pieces in three days, owing to the rush of new labor. At the\r\nend of it the girl who had carried the red flag went downtown and got a\r\nposition in a great department store, at a salary of two dollars and a\r\nhalf a week.\r\n\r\nJurgis and Ona heard these stories with dismay, for there was no\r\ntelling when their own time might come. Once or twice there had been\r\nrumors that one of the big houses was going to cut its unskilled men to\r\nfifteen cents an hour, and Jurgis knew that if this was done, his turn\r\nwould come soon. He had learned by this time that Packingtown was\r\nreally not a number of firms at all, but one great firm, the Beef\r\nTrust. And every week the managers of it got together and compared\r\nnotes, and there was one scale for all the workers in the yards and one\r\nstandard of efficiency. Jurgis was told that they also fixed the price\r\nthey would pay for beef on the hoof and the price of all dressed meat\r\nin the country; but that was something he did not understand or care\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThe only one who was not afraid of a cut was Marija, who congratulated\r\nherself, somewhat na\xc3\xafvely, that there had been one in her place only a\r\nshort time before she came. Marija was getting to be a skilled\r\nbeef-trimmer, and was mounting to the heights again. During the summer\r\nand fall Jurgis and Ona managed to pay her back the last penny they\r\nowed her, and so she began to have a bank account. Tamoszius had a bank\r\naccount also, and they ran a race, and began to figure upon household\r\nexpenses once more.\r\n\r\nThe possession of vast wealth entails cares and responsibilities,\r\nhowever, as poor Marija found out. She had taken the advice of a friend\r\nand invested her savings in a bank on Ashland Avenue. Of course she\r\nknew nothing about it, except that it was big and imposing\xe2\x80\x94what\r\npossible chance has a poor foreign working girl to understand the\r\nbanking business, as it is conducted in this land of frenzied finance?\r\nSo Marija lived in a continual dread lest something should happen to\r\nher bank, and would go out of her way mornings to make sure that it was\r\nstill there. Her principal thought was of fire, for she had deposited\r\nher money in bills, and was afraid that if they were burned up the bank\r\nwould not give her any others. Jurgis made fun of her for this, for he\r\nwas a man and was proud of his superior knowledge, telling her that the\r\nbank had fireproof vaults, and all its millions of dollars hidden\r\nsafely away in them.\r\n\r\nHowever, one morning Marija took her usual detour, and, to her horror\r\nand dismay, saw a crowd of people in front of the bank, filling the\r\navenue solid for half a block. All the blood went out of her face for\r\nterror. She broke into a run, shouting to the people to ask what was\r\nthe matter, but not stopping to hear what they answered, till she had\r\ncome to where the throng was so dense that she could no longer advance.\r\nThere was a \xe2\x80\x9crun on the bank,\xe2\x80\x9d they told her then, but she did not know\r\nwhat that was, and turned from one person to another, trying in an\r\nagony of fear to make out what they meant. Had something gone wrong\r\nwith the bank? Nobody was sure, but they thought so. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she get\r\nher money? There was no telling; the people were afraid not, and they\r\nwere all trying to get it. It was too early yet to tell anything\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbank would not open for nearly three hours. So in a frenzy of despair\r\nMarija began to claw her way toward the doors of this building, through\r\na throng of men, women, and children, all as excited as herself. It was\r\na scene of wild confusion, women shrieking and wringing their hands and\r\nfainting, and men fighting and trampling down everything in their way.\r\nIn the midst of the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e Marija recollected that she did not have her\r\nbankbook, and could not get her money anyway, so she fought her way out\r\nand started on a run for home. This was fortunate for her, for a few\r\nminutes later the police reserves arrived.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour Marija was back, Teta Elzbieta with her, both of them\r\nbreathless with running and sick with fear. The crowd was now formed in\r\na line, extending for several blocks, with half a hundred policemen\r\nkeeping guard, and so there was nothing for them to do but to take\r\ntheir places at the end of it. At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the bank opened and\r\nbegan to pay the waiting throng; but then, what good did that do\r\nMarija, who saw three thousand people before her\xe2\x80\x94enough to take out the\r\nlast penny of a dozen banks?\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse a drizzling rain came up, and soaked them to the\r\nskin; yet all the morning they stood there, creeping slowly toward the\r\ngoal\xe2\x80\x94all the afternoon they stood there, heartsick, seeing that the\r\nhour of closing was coming, and that they were going to be left out.\r\nMarija made up her mind that, come what might, she would stay there and\r\nkeep her place; but as nearly all did the same, all through the long,\r\ncold night, she got very little closer to the bank for that. Toward\r\nevening Jurgis came; he had heard the story from the children, and he\r\nbrought some food and dry wraps, which made it a little easier.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before daybreak, came a bigger crowd than ever, and\r\nmore policemen from downtown. Marija held on like grim death, and\r\ntoward afternoon she got into the bank and got her money\xe2\x80\x94all in big\r\nsilver dollars, a handkerchief full. When she had once got her hands on\r\nthem her fear vanished, and she wanted to put them back again; but the\r\nman at the window was savage, and said that the bank would receive no\r\nmore deposits from those who had taken part in the run. So Marija was\r\nforced to take her dollars home with her, watching to right and left,\r\nexpecting every instant that some one would try to rob her; and when\r\nshe got home she was not much better off. Until she could find another\r\nbank there was nothing to do but sew them up in her clothes, and so\r\nMarija went about for a week or more, loaded down with bullion, and\r\nafraid to cross the street in front of the house, because Jurgis told\r\nher she would sink out of sight in the mud. Weighted this way she made\r\nher way to the yards, again in fear, this time to see if she had lost\r\nher place; but fortunately about ten per cent of the working people of\r\nPackingtown had been depositors in that bank, and it was not convenient\r\nto discharge that many at once. The cause of the panic had been the\r\nattempt of a policeman to arrest a drunken man in a saloon next door,\r\nwhich had drawn a crowd at the hour the people were on their way to\r\nwork, and so started the \xe2\x80\x9crun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout this time Jurgis and Ona also began a bank account. Besides\r\nhaving paid Jonas and Marija, they had almost paid for their furniture,\r\nand could have that little sum to count on. So long as each of them\r\ncould bring home nine or ten dollars a week, they were able to get\r\nalong finely. Also election day came round again, and Jurgis made half\r\na week\xe2\x80\x99s wages out of that, all net profit. It was a very close\r\nelection that year, and the echoes of the battle reached even to\r\nPackingtown. The two rival sets of grafters hired halls and set off\r\nfireworks and made speeches, to try to get the people interested in the\r\nmatter. Although Jurgis did not understand it all, he knew enough by\r\nthis time to realize that it was not supposed to be right to sell your\r\nvote. However, as every one did it, and his refusal to join would not\r\nhave made the slightest difference in the results, the idea of refusing\r\nwould have seemed absurd, had it ever come into his head.\r\n\r\nNow chill winds and shortening days began to warn them that the winter\r\nwas coming again. It seemed as if the respite had been too short\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nhad not had time enough to get ready for it; but still it came,\r\ninexorably, and the hunted look began to come back into the eyes of\r\nlittle Stanislovas. The prospect struck fear to the heart of Jurgis\r\nalso, for he knew that Ona was not fit to face the cold and the\r\nsnowdrifts this year. And suppose that some day when a blizzard struck\r\nthem and the cars were not running, Ona should have to give up, and\r\nshould come the next day to find that her place had been given to some\r\none who lived nearer and could be depended on?\r\n\r\nIt was the week before Christmas that the first storm came, and then\r\nthe soul of Jurgis rose up within him like a sleeping lion. There were\r\nfour days that the Ashland Avenue cars were stalled, and in those days,\r\nfor the first time in his life, Jurgis knew what it was to be really\r\nopposed. He had faced difficulties before, but they had been child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplay; now there was a death struggle, and all the furies were unchained\r\nwithin him. The first morning they set out two hours before dawn, Ona\r\nwrapped all in blankets and tossed upon his shoulder like a sack of\r\nmeal, and the little boy, bundled nearly out of sight, hanging by his\r\ncoat-tails. There was a raging blast beating in his face, and the\r\nthermometer stood below zero; the snow was never short of his knees,\r\nand in some of the drifts it was nearly up to his armpits. It would\r\ncatch his feet and try to trip him; it would build itself into a wall\r\nbefore him to beat him back; and he would fling himself into it,\r\nplunging like a wounded buffalo, puffing and snorting in rage. So foot\r\nby foot he drove his way, and when at last he came to Durham\xe2\x80\x99s he was\r\nstaggering and almost blind, and leaned against a pillar, gasping, and\r\nthanking God that the cattle came late to the killing beds that day. In\r\nthe evening the same thing had to be done again; and because Jurgis\r\ncould not tell what hour of the night he would get off, he got a\r\nsaloon-keeper to let Ona sit and wait for him in a corner. Once it was\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, and black as the pit, but still they got home.\r\n\r\nThat blizzard knocked many a man out, for the crowd outside begging for\r\nwork was never greater, and the packers would not wait long for any\r\none. When it was over, the soul of Jurgis was a song, for he had met\r\nthe enemy and conquered, and felt himself the master of his fate.\xe2\x80\x94So it\r\nmight be with some monarch of the forest that has vanquished his foes\r\nin fair fight, and then falls into some cowardly trap in the\r\nnight-time.\r\n\r\nA time of peril on the killing beds was when a steer broke loose.\r\nSometimes, in the haste of speeding-up, they would dump one of the\r\nanimals out on the floor before it was fully stunned, and it would get\r\nupon its feet and run amuck. Then there would be a yell of warning\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmen would drop everything and dash for the nearest pillar, slipping\r\nhere and there on the floor, and tumbling over each other. This was bad\r\nenough in the summer, when a man could see; in wintertime it was enough\r\nto make your hair stand up, for the room would be so full of steam that\r\nyou could not make anything out five feet in front of you. To be sure,\r\nthe steer was generally blind and frantic, and not especially bent on\r\nhurting any one; but think of the chances of running upon a knife,\r\nwhile nearly every man had one in his hand! And then, to cap the\r\nclimax, the floor boss would come rushing up with a rifle and begin\r\nblazing away!\r\n\r\nIt was in one of these m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9es that Jurgis fell into his trap. That is\r\nthe only word to describe it; it was so cruel, and so utterly not to be\r\nforeseen. At first he hardly noticed it, it was such a slight\r\naccident\xe2\x80\x94simply that in leaping out of the way he turned his ankle.\r\nThere was a twinge of pain, but Jurgis was used to pain, and did not\r\ncoddle himself. When he came to walk home, however, he realized that it\r\nwas hurting him a great deal; and in the morning his ankle was swollen\r\nout nearly double its size, and he could not get his foot into his\r\nshoe. Still, even then, he did nothing more than swear a little, and\r\nwrapped his foot in old rags, and hobbled out to take the car. It\r\nchanced to be a rush day at Durham\xe2\x80\x99s, and all the long morning he\r\nlimped about with his aching foot; by noontime the pain was so great\r\nthat it made him faint, and after a couple of hours in the afternoon he\r\nwas fairly beaten, and had to tell the boss. They sent for the company\r\ndoctor, and he examined the foot and told Jurgis to go home to bed,\r\nadding that he had probably laid himself up for months by his folly.\r\nThe injury was not one that Durham and Company could be held\r\nresponsible for, and so that was all there was to it, so far as the\r\ndoctor was concerned.\r\n\r\nJurgis got home somehow, scarcely able to see for the pain, and with an\r\nawful terror in his soul, Elzbieta helped him into bed and bandaged his\r\ninjured foot with cold water and tried hard not to let him see her\r\ndismay; when the rest came home at night she met them outside and told\r\nthem, and they, too, put on a cheerful face, saying it would only be\r\nfor a week or two, and that they would pull him through.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gotten him to sleep, however, they sat by the kitchen\r\nfire and talked it over in frightened whispers. They were in for a\r\nsiege, that was plainly to be seen. Jurgis had only about sixty dollars\r\nin the bank, and the slack season was upon them. Both Jonas and Marija\r\nmight soon be earning no more than enough to pay their board, and\r\nbesides that there were only the wages of Ona and the pittance of the\r\nlittle boy. There was the rent to pay, and still some on the furniture;\r\nthere was the insurance just due, and every month there was sack after\r\nsack of coal. It was January, midwinter, an awful time to have to face\r\nprivation. Deep snows would come again, and who would carry Ona to her\r\nwork now? She might lose her place\xe2\x80\x94she was almost certain to lose it.\r\nAnd then little Stanislovas began to whimper\xe2\x80\x94who would take care of\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nIt was dreadful that an accident of this sort, that no man can help,\r\nshould have meant such suffering. The bitterness of it was the daily\r\nfood and drink of Jurgis. It was of no use for them to try to deceive\r\nhim; he knew as much about the situation as they did, and he knew that\r\nthe family might literally starve to death. The worry of it fairly ate\r\nhim up\xe2\x80\x94he began to look haggard the first two or three days of it. In\r\ntruth, it was almost maddening for a strong man like him, a fighter, to\r\nhave to lie there helpless on his back. It was for all the world the\r\nold story of Prometheus bound. As Jurgis lay on his bed, hour after\r\nhour there came to him emotions that he had never known before. Before\r\nthis he had met life with a welcome\xe2\x80\x94it had its trials, but none that a\r\nman could not face. But now, in the nighttime, when he lay tossing\r\nabout, there would come stalking into his chamber a grisly phantom, the\r\nsight of which made his flesh curl and his hair to bristle up. It was\r\nlike seeing the world fall away from underneath his feet; like plunging\r\ndown into a bottomless abyss into yawning caverns of despair. It might\r\nbe true, then, after all, what others had told him about life, that the\r\nbest powers of a man might not be equal to it! It might be true that,\r\nstrive as he would, toil as he would, he might fail, and go down and be\r\ndestroyed! The thought of this was like an icy hand at his heart; the\r\nthought that here, in this ghastly home of all horror, he and all those\r\nwho were dear to him might lie and perish of starvation and cold, and\r\nthere would be no ear to hear their cry, no hand to help them! It was\r\ntrue, it was true,\xe2\x80\x94that here in this huge city, with its stores of\r\nheaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by\r\nthe wild-beast powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the\r\ndays of the cave men!\r\n\r\nOna was now making about thirty dollars a month, and Stanislovas about\r\nthirteen. To add to this there was the board of Jonas and Marija, about\r\nforty-five dollars. Deducting from this the rent, interest, and\r\ninstallments on the furniture, they had left sixty dollars, and\r\ndeducting the coal, they had fifty. They did without everything that\r\nhuman beings could do without; they went in old and ragged clothing,\r\nthat left them at the mercy of the cold, and when the children\xe2\x80\x99s shoes\r\nwore out, they tied them up with string. Half invalid as she was, Ona\r\nwould do herself harm by walking in the rain and cold when she ought to\r\nhave ridden; they bought literally nothing but food\xe2\x80\x94and still they\r\ncould not keep alive on fifty dollars a month. They might have done it,\r\nif only they could have gotten pure food, and at fair prices; or if\r\nonly they had known what to get\xe2\x80\x94if they had not been so pitifully\r\nignorant! But they had come to a new country, where everything was\r\ndifferent, including the food. They had always been accustomed to eat a\r\ngreat deal of smoked sausage, and how could they know that what they\r\nbought in America was not the same\xe2\x80\x94that its color was made by\r\nchemicals, and its smoky flavor by more chemicals, and that it was full\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cpotato flour\xe2\x80\x9d besides? Potato flour is the waste of potato after\r\nthe starch and alcohol have been extracted; it has no more food value\r\nthan so much wood, and as its use as a food adulterant is a penal\r\noffense in Europe, thousands of tons of it are shipped to America every\r\nyear. It was amazing what quantities of food such as this were needed\r\nevery day, by eleven hungry persons. A dollar sixty-five a day was\r\nsimply not enough to feed them, and there was no use trying; and so\r\neach week they made an inroad upon the pitiful little bank account that\r\nOna had begun. Because the account was in her name, it was possible for\r\nher to keep this a secret from her husband, and to keep the\r\nheartsickness of it for her own.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better if Jurgis had been really ill; if he had not\r\nbeen able to think. For he had no resources such as most invalids have;\r\nall he could do was to lie there and toss about from side to side. Now\r\nand then he would break into cursing, regardless of everything; and now\r\nand then his impatience would get the better of him, and he would try\r\nto get up, and poor Teta Elzbieta would have to plead with him in a\r\nfrenzy. Elzbieta was all alone with him the greater part of the time.\r\nShe would sit and smooth his forehead by the hour, and talk to him and\r\ntry to make him forget. Sometimes it would be too cold for the children\r\nto go to school, and they would have to play in the kitchen, where\r\nJurgis was, because it was the only room that was half warm. These were\r\ndreadful times, for Jurgis would get as cross as any bear; he was\r\nscarcely to be blamed, for he had enough to worry him, and it was hard\r\nwhen he was trying to take a nap to be kept awake by noisy and peevish\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nElzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s only resource in those times was little Antanas; indeed, it\r\nwould be hard to say how they could have gotten along at all if it had\r\nnot been for little Antanas. It was the one consolation of Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 long\r\nimprisonment that now he had time to look at his baby. Teta Elzbieta\r\nwould put the clothes-basket in which the baby slept alongside of his\r\nmattress, and Jurgis would lie upon one elbow and watch him by the\r\nhour, imagining things. Then little Antanas would open his eyes\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nbeginning to take notice of things now; and he would smile\xe2\x80\x94how he would\r\nsmile! So Jurgis would begin to forget and be happy because he was in a\r\nworld where there was a thing so beautiful as the smile of little\r\nAntanas, and because such a world could not but be good at the heart of\r\nit. He looked more like his father every hour, Elzbieta would say, and\r\nsaid it many times a day, because she saw that it pleased Jurgis; the\r\npoor little terror-stricken woman was planning all day and all night to\r\nsoothe the prisoned giant who was intrusted to her care. Jurgis, who\r\nknew nothing about the age-long and everlasting hypocrisy of woman,\r\nwould take the bait and grin with delight; and then he would hold his\r\nfinger in front of little Antanas\xe2\x80\x99 eyes, and move it this way and that,\r\nand laugh with glee to see the baby follow it. There is no pet quite so\r\nfascinating as a baby; he would look into Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 face with such\r\nuncanny seriousness, and Jurgis would start and cry: \xe2\x80\x9c_Palauk!_ Look,\r\nMuma, he knows his papa! He does, he does! _Tu mano szirdele_, the\r\nlittle rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor three weeks after his injury Jurgis never got up from bed. It was a\r\nvery obstinate sprain; the swelling would not go down, and the pain\r\nstill continued. At the end of that time, however, he could contain\r\nhimself no longer, and began trying to walk a little every day,\r\nlaboring to persuade himself that he was better. No arguments could\r\nstop him, and three or four days later he declared that he was going\r\nback to work. He limped to the cars and got to Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, where he found\r\nthat the boss had kept his place\xe2\x80\x94that is, was willing to turn out into\r\nthe snow the poor devil he had hired in the meantime. Every now and\r\nthen the pain would force Jurgis to stop work, but he stuck it out till\r\nnearly an hour before closing. Then he was forced to acknowledge that\r\nhe could not go on without fainting; it almost broke his heart to do\r\nit, and he stood leaning against a pillar and weeping like a child. Two\r\nof the men had to help him to the car, and when he got out he had to\r\nsit down and wait in the snow till some one came along.\r\n\r\nSo they put him to bed again, and sent for the doctor, as they ought to\r\nhave done in the beginning. It transpired that he had twisted a tendon\r\nout of place, and could never have gotten well without attention. Then\r\nhe gripped the sides of the bed, and shut his teeth together, and\r\nturned white with agony, while the doctor pulled and wrenched away at\r\nhis swollen ankle. When finally the doctor left, he told him that he\r\nwould have to lie quiet for two months, and that if he went to work\r\nbefore that time he might lame himself for life.\r\n\r\nThree days later there came another heavy snowstorm, and Jonas and\r\nMarija and Ona and little Stanislovas all set out together, an hour\r\nbefore daybreak, to try to get to the yards. About noon the last two\r\ncame back, the boy screaming with pain. His fingers were all frosted,\r\nit seemed. They had had to give up trying to get to the yards, and had\r\nnearly perished in a drift. All that they knew how to do was to hold\r\nthe frozen fingers near the fire, and so little Stanislovas spent most\r\nof the day dancing about in horrible agony, till Jurgis flew into a\r\npassion of nervous rage and swore like a madman, declaring that he\r\nwould kill him if he did not stop. All that day and night the family\r\nwas half-crazed with fear that Ona and the boy had lost their places;\r\nand in the morning they set out earlier than ever, after the little\r\nfellow had been beaten with a stick by Jurgis. There could be no\r\ntrifling in a case like this, it was a matter of life and death; little\r\nStanislovas could not be expected to realize that he might a great deal\r\nbetter freeze in the snowdrift than lose his job at the lard machine.\r\nOna was quite certain that she would find her place gone, and was all\r\nunnerved when she finally got to Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, and found that the forelady\r\nherself had failed to come, and was therefore compelled to be lenient.\r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of this episode was that the first joints of\r\nthree of the little boy\xe2\x80\x99s fingers were permanently disabled, and\r\nanother that thereafter he always had to be beaten before he set out to\r\nwork, whenever there was fresh snow on the ground. Jurgis was called\r\nupon to do the beating, and as it hurt his foot he did it with a\r\nvengeance; but it did not tend to add to the sweetness of his temper.\r\nThey say that the best dog will turn cross if he be kept chained all\r\nthe time, and it was the same with the man; he had not a thing to do\r\nall day but lie and curse his fate, and the time came when he wanted to\r\ncurse everything.\r\n\r\nThis was never for very long, however, for when Ona began to cry,\r\nJurgis could not stay angry. The poor fellow looked like a homeless\r\nghost, with his cheeks sunken in and his long black hair straggling\r\ninto his eyes; he was too discouraged to cut it, or to think about his\r\nappearance. His muscles were wasting away, and what were left were soft\r\nand flabby. He had no appetite, and they could not afford to tempt him\r\nwith delicacies. It was better, he said, that he should not eat, it was\r\na saving. About the end of March he had got hold of Ona\xe2\x80\x99s bankbook, and\r\nlearned that there was only three dollars left to them in the world.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the worst of the consequences of this long siege was that\r\nthey lost another member of their family; Brother Jonas disappeared.\r\nOne Saturday night he did not come home, and thereafter all their\r\nefforts to get trace of him were futile. It was said by the boss at\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s that he had gotten his week\xe2\x80\x99s money and left there. That might\r\nnot be true, of course, for sometimes they would say that when a man\r\nhad been killed; it was the easiest way out of it for all concerned.\r\nWhen, for instance, a man had fallen into one of the rendering tanks\r\nand had been made into pure leaf lard and peerless fertilizer, there\r\nwas no use letting the fact out and making his family unhappy. More\r\nprobable, however, was the theory that Jonas had deserted them, and\r\ngone on the road, seeking happiness. He had been discontented for a\r\nlong time, and not without some cause. He paid good board, and was yet\r\nobliged to live in a family where nobody had enough to eat. And Marija\r\nwould keep giving them all her money, and of course he could not but\r\nfeel that he was called upon to do the same. Then there were crying\r\nbrats, and all sorts of misery; a man would have had to be a good deal\r\nof a hero to stand it all without grumbling, and Jonas was not in the\r\nleast a hero\xe2\x80\x94he was simply a weatherbeaten old fellow who liked to have\r\na good supper and sit in the corner by the fire and smoke his pipe in\r\npeace before he went to bed. Here there was not room by the fire, and\r\nthrough the winter the kitchen had seldom been warm enough for comfort.\r\nSo, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea\r\nof escaping had come to him? Two years he had been yoked like a horse\r\nto a half-ton truck in Durham\xe2\x80\x99s dark cellars, with never a rest, save\r\non Sundays and four holidays in the year, and with never a word of\r\nthanks\xe2\x80\x94only kicks and blows and curses, such as no decent dog would\r\nhave stood. And now the winter was over, and the spring winds were\r\nblowing\xe2\x80\x94and with a day\xe2\x80\x99s walk a man might put the smoke of Packingtown\r\nbehind him forever, and be where the grass was green and the flowers\r\nall the colors of the rainbow!\r\n\r\nBut now the income of the family was cut down more than one-third, and\r\nthe food demand was cut only one-eleventh, so that they were worse off\r\nthan ever. Also they were borrowing money from Marija, and eating up\r\nher bank account, and spoiling once again her hopes of marriage and\r\nhappiness. And they were even going into debt to Tamoszius Kuszleika\r\nand letting him impoverish himself. Poor Tamoszius was a man without\r\nany relatives, and with a wonderful talent besides, and he ought to\r\nhave made money and prospered; but he had fallen in love, and so given\r\nhostages to fortune, and was doomed to be dragged down too.\r\n\r\nSo it was finally decided that two more of the children would have to\r\nleave school. Next to Stanislovas, who was now fifteen, there was a\r\ngirl, little Kotrina, who was two years younger, and then two boys,\r\nVilimas, who was eleven, and Nikalojus, who was ten. Both of these last\r\nwere bright boys, and there was no reason why their family should\r\nstarve when tens of thousands of children no older were earning their\r\nown livings. So one morning they were given a quarter apiece and a roll\r\nwith a sausage in it, and, with their minds top-heavy with good advice,\r\nwere sent out to make their way to the city and learn to sell\r\nnewspapers. They came back late at night in tears, having walked for\r\nthe five or six miles to report that a man had offered to take them to\r\na place where they sold newspapers, and had taken their money and gone\r\ninto a store to get them, and nevermore been seen. So they both\r\nreceived a whipping, and the next morning set out again. This time they\r\nfound the newspaper place, and procured their stock; and after\r\nwandering about till nearly noontime, saying \xe2\x80\x9cPaper?\xe2\x80\x9d to every one they\r\nsaw, they had all their stock taken away and received a thrashing\r\nbesides from a big newsman upon whose territory they had trespassed.\r\nFortunately, however, they had already sold some papers, and came back\r\nwith nearly as much as they started with.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of mishaps such as these, the two little fellows began to\r\nlearn the ways of the trade\xe2\x80\x94the names of the different papers, and how\r\nmany of each to get, and what sort of people to offer them to, and\r\nwhere to go and where to stay away from. After this, leaving home at\r\nfour o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and running about the streets, first with\r\nmorning papers and then with evening, they might come home late at\r\nnight with twenty or thirty cents apiece\xe2\x80\x94possibly as much as forty\r\ncents. From this they had to deduct their carfare, since the distance\r\nwas so great; but after a while they made friends, and learned still\r\nmore, and then they would save their carfare. They would get on a car\r\nwhen the conductor was not looking, and hide in the crowd; and three\r\ntimes out of four he would not ask for their fares, either not seeing\r\nthem, or thinking they had already paid; or if he did ask, they would\r\nhunt through their pockets, and then begin to cry, and either have\r\ntheir fares paid by some kind old lady, or else try the trick again on\r\na new car. All this was fair play, they felt. Whose fault was it that\r\nat the hours when workingmen were going to their work and back, the\r\ncars were so crowded that the conductors could not collect all the\r\nfares? And besides, the companies were thieves, people said\xe2\x80\x94had stolen\r\nall their franchises with the help of scoundrelly politicians!\r\n\r\nNow that the winter was by, and there was no more danger of snow, and\r\nno more coal to buy, and another room warm enough to put the children\r\ninto when they cried, and enough money to get along from week to week\r\nwith, Jurgis was less terrible than he had been. A man can get used to\r\nanything in the course of time, and Jurgis had gotten used to lying\r\nabout the house. Ona saw this, and was very careful not to destroy his\r\npeace of mind, by letting him know how very much pain she was\r\nsuffering. It was now the time of the spring rains, and Ona had often\r\nto ride to her work, in spite of the expense; she was getting paler\r\nevery day, and sometimes, in spite of her good resolutions, it pained\r\nher that Jurgis did not notice it. She wondered if he cared for her as\r\nmuch as ever, if all this misery was not wearing out his love. She had\r\nto be away from him all the time, and bear her own troubles while he\r\nwas bearing his; and then, when she came home, she was so worn out; and\r\nwhenever they talked they had only their worries to talk of\xe2\x80\x94truly it\r\nwas hard, in such a life, to keep any sentiment alive. The woe of this\r\nwould flame up in Ona sometimes\xe2\x80\x94at night she would suddenly clasp her\r\nbig husband in her arms and break into passionate weeping, demanding to\r\nknow if he really loved her. Poor Jurgis, who had in truth grown more\r\nmatter-of-fact, under the endless pressure of penury, would not know\r\nwhat to make of these things, and could only try to recollect when he\r\nhad last been cross; and so Ona would have to forgive him and sob\r\nherself to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of April Jurgis went to see the doctor, and was given a\r\nbandage to lace about his ankle, and told that he might go back to\r\nwork. It needed more than the permission of the doctor, however, for\r\nwhen he showed up on the killing floor of Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, he was told by the\r\nforeman that it had not been possible to keep his job for him. Jurgis\r\nknew that this meant simply that the foreman had found some one else to\r\ndo the work as well and did not want to bother to make a change. He\r\nstood in the doorway, looking mournfully on, seeing his friends and\r\ncompanions at work, and feeling like an outcast. Then he went out and\r\ntook his place with the mob of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, Jurgis did not have the same fine confidence, nor\r\nthe same reason for it. He was no longer the finest-looking man in the\r\nthrong, and the bosses no longer made for him; he was thin and haggard,\r\nand his clothes were seedy, and he looked miserable. And there were\r\nhundreds who looked and felt just like him, and who had been wandering\r\nabout Packingtown for months begging for work. This was a critical time\r\nin Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 life, and if he had been a weaker man he would have gone the\r\nway the rest did. Those out-of-work wretches would stand about the\r\npacking houses every morning till the police drove them away, and then\r\nthey would scatter among the saloons. Very few of them had the nerve to\r\nface the rebuffs that they would encounter by trying to get into the\r\nbuildings to interview the bosses; if they did not get a chance in the\r\nmorning, there would be nothing to do but hang about the saloons the\r\nrest of the day and night. Jurgis was saved from all this\xe2\x80\x94partly, to be\r\nsure, because it was pleasant weather, and there was no need to be\r\nindoors; but mainly because he carried with him always the pitiful\r\nlittle face of his wife. He must get work, he told himself, fighting\r\nthe battle with despair every hour of the day. He must get work! He\r\nmust have a place again and some money saved up, before the next winter\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nBut there was no work for him. He sought out all the members of his\r\nunion\xe2\x80\x94Jurgis had stuck to the union through all this\xe2\x80\x94and begged them to\r\nspeak a word for him. He went to every one he knew, asking for a\r\nchance, there or anywhere. He wandered all day through the buildings;\r\nand in a week or two, when he had been all over the yards, and into\r\nevery room to which he had access, and learned that there was not a job\r\nanywhere, he persuaded himself that there might have been a change in\r\nthe places he had first visited, and began the round all over; till\r\nfinally the watchmen and the \xe2\x80\x9cspotters\xe2\x80\x9d of the companies came to know\r\nhim by sight and to order him out with threats. Then there was nothing\r\nmore for him to do but go with the crowd in the morning, and keep in\r\nthe front row and look eager, and when he failed, go back home, and\r\nplay with little Kotrina and the baby.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar bitterness of all this was that Jurgis saw so plainly the\r\nmeaning of it. In the beginning he had been fresh and strong, and he\r\nhad gotten a job the first day; but now he was second-hand, a damaged\r\narticle, so to speak, and they did not want him. They had got the best\r\nof him\xe2\x80\x94they had worn him out, with their speeding-up and their\r\ncarelessness, and now they had thrown him away! And Jurgis would make\r\nthe acquaintance of others of these unemployed men and find that they\r\nhad all had the same experience. There were some, of course, who had\r\nwandered in from other places, who had been ground up in other mills;\r\nthere were others who were out from their own fault\xe2\x80\x94some, for instance,\r\nwho had not been able to stand the awful grind without drink. The vast\r\nmajority, however, were simply the worn-out parts of the great\r\nmerciless packing machine; they had toiled there, and kept up with the\r\npace, some of them for ten or twenty years, until finally the time had\r\ncome when they could not keep up with it any more. Some had been\r\nfrankly told that they were too old, that a sprier man was needed;\r\nothers had given occasion, by some act of carelessness or incompetence;\r\nwith most, however, the occasion had been the same as with Jurgis. They\r\nhad been overworked and underfed so long, and finally some disease had\r\nlaid them on their backs; or they had cut themselves, and had blood\r\npoisoning, or met with some other accident. When a man came back after\r\nthat, he would get his place back only by the courtesy of the boss. To\r\nthis there was no exception, save when the accident was one for which\r\nthe firm was liable; in that case they would send a slippery lawyer to\r\nsee him, first to try to get him to sign away his claims, but if he was\r\ntoo smart for that, to promise him that he and his should always be\r\nprovided with work. This promise they would keep, strictly and to the\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x94for two years. Two years was the \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nafter that the victim could not sue.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to a man after any of these things, all depended upon the\r\ncircumstances. If he were of the highly skilled workers, he would\r\nprobably have enough saved up to tide him over. The best paid men, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csplitters,\xe2\x80\x9d made fifty cents an hour, which would be five or six\r\ndollars a day in the rush seasons, and one or two in the dullest. A man\r\ncould live and save on that; but then there were only half a dozen\r\nsplitters in each place, and one of them that Jurgis knew had a family\r\nof twenty-two children, all hoping to grow up to be splitters like\r\ntheir father. For an unskilled man, who made ten dollars a week in the\r\nrush seasons and five in the dull, it all depended upon his age and the\r\nnumber he had dependent upon him. An unmarried man could save, if he\r\ndid not drink, and if he was absolutely selfish\xe2\x80\x94that is, if he paid no\r\nheed to the demands of his old parents, or of his little brothers and\r\nsisters, or of any other relatives he might have, as well as of the\r\nmembers of his union, and his chums, and the people who might be\r\nstarving to death next door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this time that Jurgis was looking for work occurred the death of\r\nlittle Kristoforas, one of the children of Teta Elzbieta. Both\r\nKristoforas and his brother, Juozapas, were cripples, the latter having\r\nlost one leg by having it run over, and Kristoforas having congenital\r\ndislocation of the hip, which made it impossible for him ever to walk.\r\nHe was the last of Teta Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s children, and perhaps he had been\r\nintended by nature to let her know that she had had enough. At any rate\r\nhe was wretchedly sick and undersized; he had the rickets, and though\r\nhe was over three years old, he was no bigger than an ordinary child of\r\none. All day long he would crawl around the floor in a filthy little\r\ndress, whining and fretting; because the floor was full of drafts he\r\nwas always catching cold, and snuffling because his nose ran. This made\r\nhim a nuisance, and a source of endless trouble in the family. For his\r\nmother, with unnatural perversity, loved him best of all her children,\r\nand made a perpetual fuss over him\xe2\x80\x94would let him do anything\r\nundisturbed, and would burst into tears when his fretting drove Jurgis\r\nwild.\r\n\r\nAnd now he died. Perhaps it was the smoked sausage he had eaten that\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94which may have been made out of some of the tubercular pork\r\nthat was condemned as unfit for export. At any rate, an hour after\r\neating it, the child had begun to cry with pain, and in another hour he\r\nwas rolling about on the floor in convulsions. Little Kotrina, who was\r\nall alone with him, ran out screaming for help, and after a while a\r\ndoctor came, but not until Kristoforas had howled his last howl. No one\r\nwas really sorry about this except poor Elzbieta, who was inconsolable.\r\nJurgis announced that so far as he was concerned the child would have\r\nto be buried by the city, since they had no money for a funeral; and at\r\nthis the poor woman almost went out of her senses, wringing her hands\r\nand screaming with grief and despair. Her child to be buried in a\r\npauper\xe2\x80\x99s grave! And her stepdaughter to stand by and hear it said\r\nwithout protesting! It was enough to make Ona\xe2\x80\x99s father rise up out of\r\nhis grave to rebuke her! If it had come to this, they might as well\r\ngive up at once, and be buried all of them together! . . . In the end\r\nMarija said that she would help with ten dollars; and Jurgis being\r\nstill obdurate, Elzbieta went in tears and begged the money from the\r\nneighbors, and so little Kristoforas had a mass and a hearse with white\r\nplumes on it, and a tiny plot in a graveyard with a wooden cross to\r\nmark the place. The poor mother was not the same for months after that;\r\nthe mere sight of the floor where little Kristoforas had crawled about\r\nwould make her weep. He had never had a fair chance, poor little\r\nfellow, she would say. He had been handicapped from his birth. If only\r\nshe had heard about it in time, so that she might have had that great\r\ndoctor to cure him of his lameness! . . . Some time ago, Elzbieta was\r\ntold, a Chicago billionaire had paid a fortune to bring a great\r\nEuropean surgeon over to cure his little daughter of the same disease\r\nfrom which Kristoforas had suffered. And because this surgeon had to\r\nhave bodies to demonstrate upon, he announced that he would treat the\r\nchildren of the poor, a piece of magnanimity over which the papers\r\nbecame quite eloquent. Elzbieta, alas, did not read the papers, and no\r\none had told her; but perhaps it was as well, for just then they would\r\nnot have had the carfare to spare to go every day to wait upon the\r\nsurgeon, nor for that matter anybody with the time to take the child.\r\n\r\nAll this while that he was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow\r\nhanging over Jurgis; as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the\r\npathway of his life, and he knew it, and yet could not help approaching\r\nthe place. There are all stages of being out of work in Packingtown,\r\nand he faced in dread the prospect of reaching the lowest. There is a\r\nplace that waits for the lowest man\xe2\x80\x94the fertilizer plant!\r\n\r\nThe men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers. Not more than one\r\nin ten had ever really tried it; the other nine had contented\r\nthemselves with hearsay evidence and a peep through the door. There\r\nwere some things worse than even starving to death. They would ask\r\nJurgis if he had worked there yet, and if he meant to; and Jurgis would\r\ndebate the matter with himself. As poor as they were, and making all\r\nthe sacrifices that they were, would he dare to refuse any sort of work\r\nthat was offered to him, be it as horrible as ever it could? Would he\r\ndare to go home and eat bread that had been earned by Ona, weak and\r\ncomplaining as she was, knowing that he had been given a chance, and\r\nhad not had the nerve to take it?\xe2\x80\x94And yet he might argue that way with\r\nhimself all day, and one glimpse into the fertilizer works would send\r\nhim away again shuddering. He was a man, and he would do his duty; he\r\nwent and made application\xe2\x80\x94but surely he was not also required to hope\r\nfor success!\r\n\r\nThe fertilizer works of Durham\xe2\x80\x99s lay away from the rest of the plant.\r\nFew visitors ever saw them, and the few who did would come out looking\r\nlike Dante, of whom the peasants declared that he had been into hell.\r\nTo this part of the yards came all the \xe2\x80\x9ctankage\xe2\x80\x9d and the waste products\r\nof all sorts; here they dried out the bones,\xe2\x80\x94and in suffocating cellars\r\nwhere the daylight never came you might see men and women and children\r\nbending over whirling machines and sawing bits of bone into all sorts\r\nof shapes, breathing their lungs full of the fine dust, and doomed to\r\ndie, every one of them, within a certain definite time. Here they made\r\nthe blood into albumen, and made other foul-smelling things into things\r\nstill more foul-smelling. In the corridors and caverns where it was\r\ndone you might lose yourself as in the great caves of Kentucky. In the\r\ndust and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off\r\ntwinkling stars\xe2\x80\x94red and blue-green and purple stars, according to the\r\ncolor of the mist and the brew from which it came. For the odors of\r\nthese ghastly charnel houses there may be words in Lithuanian, but\r\nthere are none in English. The person entering would have to summon his\r\ncourage as for a cold-water plunge. He would go in like a man swimming\r\nunder water; he would put his handkerchief over his face, and begin to\r\ncough and choke; and then, if he were still obstinate, he would find\r\nhis head beginning to ring, and the veins in his forehead to throb,\r\nuntil finally he would be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia\r\nfumes, and would turn and run for his life, and come out half-dazed.\r\n\r\nOn top of this were the rooms where they dried the \xe2\x80\x9ctankage,\xe2\x80\x9d the mass\r\nof brown stringy stuff that was left after the waste portions of the\r\ncarcasses had had the lard and tallow dried out of them. This dried\r\nmaterial they would then grind to a fine powder, and after they had\r\nmixed it up well with a mysterious but inoffensive brown rock which\r\nthey brought in and ground up by the hundreds of carloads for that\r\npurpose, the substance was ready to be put into bags and sent out to\r\nthe world as any one of a hundred different brands of standard bone\r\nphosphate. And then the farmer in Maine or California or Texas would\r\nbuy this, at say twenty-five dollars a ton, and plant it with his corn;\r\nand for several days after the operation the fields would have a strong\r\nodor, and the farmer and his wagon and the very horses that had hauled\r\nit would all have it too. In Packingtown the fertilizer is pure,\r\ninstead of being a flavoring, and instead of a ton or so spread out on\r\nseveral acres under the open sky, there are hundreds and thousands of\r\ntons of it in one building, heaped here and there in haystack piles,\r\ncovering the floor several inches deep, and filling the air with a\r\nchoking dust that becomes a blinding sandstorm when the wind stirs.\r\n\r\nIt was to this building that Jurgis came daily, as if dragged by an\r\nunseen hand. The month of May was an exceptionally cool one, and his\r\nsecret prayers were granted; but early in June there came a\r\nrecord-breaking hot spell, and after that there were men wanted in the\r\nfertilizer mill.\r\n\r\nThe boss of the grinding room had come to know Jurgis by this time, and\r\nhad marked him for a likely man; and so when he came to the door about\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock this breathless hot day, he felt a sudden spasm of pain\r\nshoot through him\xe2\x80\x94the boss beckoned to him! In ten minutes more Jurgis\r\nhad pulled off his coat and overshirt, and set his teeth together and\r\ngone to work. Here was one more difficulty for him to meet and conquer!\r\n\r\nHis labor took him about one minute to learn. Before him was one of the\r\nvents of the mill in which the fertilizer was being ground\xe2\x80\x94rushing\r\nforth in a great brown river, with a spray of the finest dust flung\r\nforth in clouds. Jurgis was given a shovel, and along with half a dozen\r\nothers it was his task to shovel this fertilizer into carts. That\r\nothers were at work he knew by the sound, and by the fact that he\r\nsometimes collided with them; otherwise they might as well not have\r\nbeen there, for in the blinding dust storm a man could not see six feet\r\nin front of his face. When he had filled one cart he had to grope\r\naround him until another came, and if there was none on hand he\r\ncontinued to grope till one arrived. In five minutes he was, of course,\r\na mass of fertilizer from head to feet; they gave him a sponge to tie\r\nover his mouth, so that he could breathe, but the sponge did not\r\nprevent his lips and eyelids from caking up with it and his ears from\r\nfilling solid. He looked like a brown ghost at twilight\xe2\x80\x94from hair to\r\nshoes he became the color of the building and of everything in it, and\r\nfor that matter a hundred yards outside it. The building had to be left\r\nopen, and when the wind blew Durham and Company lost a great deal of\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nWorking in his shirt sleeves, and with the thermometer at over a\r\nhundred, the phosphates soaked in through every pore of Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 skin,\r\nand in five minutes he had a headache, and in fifteen was almost dazed.\r\nThe blood was pounding in his brain like an engine\xe2\x80\x99s throbbing; there\r\nwas a frightful pain in the top of his skull, and he could hardly\r\ncontrol his hands. Still, with the memory of his four months\xe2\x80\x99 siege\r\nbehind him, he fought on, in a frenzy of determination; and half an\r\nhour later he began to vomit\xe2\x80\x94he vomited until it seemed as if his\r\ninwards must be torn into shreds. A man could get used to the\r\nfertilizer mill, the boss had said, if he would make up his mind to it;\r\nbut Jurgis now began to see that it was a question of making up his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that day of horror, he could scarcely stand. He had to\r\ncatch himself now and then, and lean against a building and get his\r\nbearings. Most of the men, when they came out, made straight for a\r\nsaloon\xe2\x80\x94they seemed to place fertilizer and rattlesnake poison in one\r\nclass. But Jurgis was too ill to think of drinking\xe2\x80\x94he could only make\r\nhis way to the street and stagger on to a car. He had a sense of humor,\r\nand later on, when he became an old hand, he used to think it fun to\r\nboard a streetcar and see what happened. Now, however, he was too ill\r\nto notice it\xe2\x80\x94how the people in the car began to gasp and sputter, to\r\nput their handkerchiefs to their noses, and transfix him with furious\r\nglances. Jurgis only knew that a man in front of him immediately got up\r\nand gave him a seat; and that half a minute later the two people on\r\neach side of him got up; and that in a full minute the crowded car was\r\nnearly empty\xe2\x80\x94those passengers who could not get room on the platform\r\nhaving gotten out to walk.\r\n\r\nOf course Jurgis had made his home a miniature fertilizer mill a minute\r\nafter entering. The stuff was half an inch deep in his skin\xe2\x80\x94his whole\r\nsystem was full of it, and it would have taken a week not merely of\r\nscrubbing, but of vigorous exercise, to get it out of him. As it was,\r\nhe could be compared with nothing known to men, save that newest\r\ndiscovery of the savants, a substance which emits energy for an\r\nunlimited time, without being itself in the least diminished in power.\r\nHe smelled so that he made all the food at the table taste, and set the\r\nwhole family to vomiting; for himself it was three days before he could\r\nkeep anything upon his stomach\xe2\x80\x94he might wash his hands, and use a knife\r\nand fork, but were not his mouth and throat filled with the poison?\r\n\r\nAnd still Jurgis stuck it out! In spite of splitting headaches he would\r\nstagger down to the plant and take up his stand once more, and begin to\r\nshovel in the blinding clouds of dust. And so at the end of the week he\r\nwas a fertilizer man for life\xe2\x80\x94he was able to eat again, and though his\r\nhead never stopped aching, it ceased to be so bad that he could not\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nSo there passed another summer. It was a summer of prosperity, all over\r\nthe country, and the country ate generously of packing house products,\r\nand there was plenty of work for all the family, in spite of the\r\npackers\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to keep a superfluity of labor. They were again able\r\nto pay their debts and to begin to save a little sum; but there were\r\none or two sacrifices they considered too heavy to be made for long\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas too bad that the boys should have to sell papers at their age. It\r\nwas utterly useless to caution them and plead with them; quite without\r\nknowing it, they were taking on the tone of their new environment. They\r\nwere learning to swear in voluble English; they were learning to pick\r\nup cigar stumps and smoke them, to pass hours of their time gambling\r\nwith pennies and dice and cigarette cards; they were learning the\r\nlocation of all the houses of prostitution on the \xe2\x80\x9cL\xc3\xaav\xc3\xa9e,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nnames of the \xe2\x80\x9cmadames\xe2\x80\x9d who kept them, and the days when they gave their\r\nstate banquets, which the police captains and the big politicians all\r\nattended. If a visiting \xe2\x80\x9ccountry customer\xe2\x80\x9d were to ask them, they could\r\nshow him which was \xe2\x80\x9cHinkydink\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d famous saloon, and could even point\r\nout to him by name the different gamblers and thugs and \xe2\x80\x9chold-up men\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwho made the place their headquarters. And worse yet, the boys were\r\ngetting out of the habit of coming home at night. What was the use,\r\nthey would ask, of wasting time and energy and a possible carfare\r\nriding out to the stockyards every night when the weather was pleasant\r\nand they could crawl under a truck or into an empty doorway and sleep\r\nexactly as well? So long as they brought home a half dollar for each\r\nday, what mattered it when they brought it? But Jurgis declared that\r\nfrom this to ceasing to come at all would not be a very long step, and\r\nso it was decided that Vilimas and Nikalojus should return to school in\r\nthe fall, and that instead Elzbieta should go out and get some work,\r\nher place at home being taken by her younger daughter.\r\n\r\nLittle Kotrina was like most children of the poor, prematurely made\r\nold; she had to take care of her little brother, who was a cripple, and\r\nalso of the baby; she had to cook the meals and wash the dishes and\r\nclean house, and have supper ready when the workers came home in the\r\nevening. She was only thirteen, and small for her age, but she did all\r\nthis without a murmur; and her mother went out, and after trudging a\r\ncouple of days about the yards, settled down as a servant of a \xe2\x80\x9csausage\r\nmachine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElzbieta was used to working, but she found this change a hard one, for\r\nthe reason that she had to stand motionless upon her feet from seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning till half-past twelve, and again from one till\r\nhalf-past five. For the first few days it seemed to her that she could\r\nnot stand it\xe2\x80\x94she suffered almost as much as Jurgis had from the\r\nfertilizer, and would come out at sundown with her head fairly reeling.\r\nBesides this, she was working in one of the dark holes, by electric\r\nlight, and the dampness, too, was deadly\xe2\x80\x94there were always puddles of\r\nwater on the floor, and a sickening odor of moist flesh in the room.\r\nThe people who worked here followed the ancient custom of nature,\r\nwhereby the ptarmigan is the color of dead leaves in the fall and of\r\nsnow in the winter, and the chameleon, who is black when he lies upon a\r\nstump and turns green when he moves to a leaf. The men and women who\r\nworked in this department were precisely the color of the \xe2\x80\x9cfresh\r\ncountry sausage\xe2\x80\x9d they made.\r\n\r\nThe sausage-room was an interesting place to visit, for two or three\r\nminutes, and provided that you did not look at the people; the machines\r\nwere perhaps the most wonderful things in the entire plant. Presumably\r\nsausages were once chopped and stuffed by hand, and if so it would be\r\ninteresting to know how many workers had been displaced by these\r\ninventions. On one side of the room were the hoppers, into which men\r\nshoveled loads of meat and wheelbarrows full of spices; in these great\r\nbowls were whirling knives that made two thousand revolutions a minute,\r\nand when the meat was ground fine and adulterated with potato flour,\r\nand well mixed with water, it was forced to the stuffing machines on\r\nthe other side of the room. The latter were tended by women; there was\r\na sort of spout, like the nozzle of a hose, and one of the women would\r\ntake a long string of \xe2\x80\x9ccasing\xe2\x80\x9d and put the end over the nozzle and then\r\nwork the whole thing on, as one works on the finger of a tight glove.\r\nThis string would be twenty or thirty feet long, but the woman would\r\nhave it all on in a jiffy; and when she had several on, she would press\r\na lever, and a stream of sausage meat would be shot out, taking the\r\ncasing with it as it came. Thus one might stand and see appear,\r\nmiraculously born from the machine, a wriggling snake of sausage of\r\nincredible length. In front was a big pan which caught these creatures,\r\nand two more women who seized them as fast as they appeared and twisted\r\nthem into links. This was for the uninitiated the most perplexing work\r\nof all; for all that the woman had to give was a single turn of the\r\nwrist; and in some way she contrived to give it so that instead of an\r\nendless chain of sausages, one after another, there grew under her\r\nhands a bunch of strings, all dangling from a single center. It was\r\nquite like the feat of a prestidigitator\xe2\x80\x94for the woman worked so fast\r\nthat the eye could literally not follow her, and there was only a mist\r\nof motion, and tangle after tangle of sausages appearing. In the midst\r\nof the mist, however, the visitor would suddenly notice the tense set\r\nface, with the two wrinkles graven in the forehead, and the ghastly\r\npallor of the cheeks; and then he would suddenly recollect that it was\r\ntime he was going on. The woman did not go on; she stayed right\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94hour after hour, day after day, year after year, twisting sausage\r\nlinks and racing with death. It was piecework, and she was apt to have\r\na family to keep alive; and stern and ruthless economic laws had\r\narranged it that she could only do this by working just as she did,\r\nwith all her soul upon her work, and with never an instant for a glance\r\nat the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who came to stare at her, as\r\nat some wild beast in a menagerie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWith one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a\r\nsausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge of the great\r\nmajority of Packingtown swindles. For it was the custom, as they found,\r\nwhenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything\r\nelse, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage. With what\r\nhad been told them by Jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they\r\ncould now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside,\r\nand read a new and grim meaning into that old Packingtown jest\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthey use everything of the pig except the squeal.\r\n\r\nJonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would\r\noften be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take\r\naway the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of\r\nall the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort\r\nof meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor\r\nand any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious\r\napparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the\r\nplant\xe2\x80\x94a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by\r\nplunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man\r\ncould fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of\r\nthis, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so\r\nbad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump\r\ninto these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which\r\ndestroyed the odor\xe2\x80\x94a process known to the workers as \xe2\x80\x9cgiving them\r\nthirty per cent.\xe2\x80\x9d Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be\r\nfound some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumber Three Grade,\xe2\x80\x9d but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a\r\nnew device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad\r\npart generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this\r\ninvention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such\r\nschemes\xe2\x80\x94they had what they called \xe2\x80\x9cboneless hams,\xe2\x80\x9d which were all the\r\nodds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia hams,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the\r\nmeat cut out; and fancy \xe2\x80\x9cskinned hams,\xe2\x80\x9d which were made of the oldest\r\nhogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chead cheese!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the\r\ndepartment of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute\r\nflyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was\r\nin a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention\r\npaid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back\r\nfrom Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and\r\nwhite\xe2\x80\x94it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the\r\nhoppers, and made over again for home consumption. There would be meat\r\nthat had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the\r\nworkers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.\r\nThere would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from\r\nleaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about\r\non it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man\r\ncould run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of\r\nthe dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers\r\nwould put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats,\r\nbread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy\r\nstory and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man\r\nwho did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he\r\nsaw one\xe2\x80\x94there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with\r\nwhich a poisoned rat was a tidbit. There was no place for the men to\r\nwash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a\r\npractice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the\r\nsausage. There were the butt-ends of smoked meat, and the scraps of\r\ncorned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, that\r\nwould be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there. Under\r\nthe system of rigid economy which the packers enforced, there were some\r\njobs that it only paid to do once in a long time, and among these was\r\nthe cleaning out of the waste barrels. Every spring they did it; and in\r\nthe barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ncartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the\r\nhoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast. Some\r\nof it they would make into \xe2\x80\x9csmoked\xe2\x80\x9d sausage\xe2\x80\x94but as the smoking took\r\ntime, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry\r\ndepartment, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatine to\r\nmake it brown. All of their sausage came out of the same bowl, but when\r\nthey came to wrap it they would stamp some of it \xe2\x80\x9cspecial,\xe2\x80\x9d and for\r\nthis they would charge two cents more a pound.\r\n\r\nSuch were the new surroundings in which Elzbieta was placed, and such\r\nwas the work she was compelled to do. It was stupefying, brutalizing\r\nwork; it left her no time to think, no strength for anything. She was\r\npart of the machine she tended, and every faculty that was not needed\r\nfor the machine was doomed to be crushed out of existence. There was\r\nonly one mercy about the cruel grind\xe2\x80\x94that it gave her the gift of\r\ninsensibility. Little by little she sank into a torpor\xe2\x80\x94she fell silent.\r\nShe would meet Jurgis and Ona in the evening, and the three would walk\r\nhome together, often without saying a word. Ona, too, was falling into\r\na habit of silence\xe2\x80\x94Ona, who had once gone about singing like a bird.\r\nShe was sick and miserable, and often she would barely have strength\r\nenough to drag herself home. And there they would eat what they had to\r\neat, and afterward, because there was only their misery to talk of,\r\nthey would crawl into bed and fall into a stupor and never stir until\r\nit was time to get up again, and dress by candlelight, and go back to\r\nthe machines. They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much\r\nfrom hunger, now; only the children continued to fret when the food ran\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nYet the soul of Ona was not dead\xe2\x80\x94the souls of none of them were dead,\r\nbut only sleeping; and now and then they would waken, and these were\r\ncruel times. The gates of memory would roll open\xe2\x80\x94old joys would stretch\r\nout their arms to them, old hopes and dreams would call to them, and\r\nthey would stir beneath the burden that lay upon them, and feel its\r\nforever immeasurable weight. They could not even cry out beneath it;\r\nbut anguish would seize them, more dreadful than the agony of death. It\r\nwas a thing scarcely to be spoken\xe2\x80\x94a thing never spoken by all the\r\nworld, that will not know its own defeat.\r\n\r\nThey were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside. It was\r\nnot less tragic because it was so sordid, because it had to do with\r\nwages and grocery bills and rents. They had dreamed of freedom; of a\r\nchance to look about them and learn something; to be decent and clean,\r\nto see their child grow up to be strong. And now it was all gone\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould never be! They had played the game and they had lost. Six years\r\nmore of toil they had to face before they could expect the least\r\nrespite, the cessation of the payments upon the house; and how cruelly\r\ncertain it was that they could never stand six years of such a life as\r\nthey were living! They were lost, they were going down\xe2\x80\x94and there was no\r\ndeliverance for them, no hope; for all the help it gave them the vast\r\ncity in which they lived might have been an ocean waste, a wilderness,\r\na desert, a tomb. So often this mood would come to Ona, in the\r\nnighttime, when something wakened her; she would lie, afraid of the\r\nbeating of her own heart, fronting the blood-red eyes of the old\r\nprimeval terror of life. Once she cried aloud, and woke Jurgis, who was\r\ntired and cross. After that she learned to weep silently\xe2\x80\x94their moods so\r\nseldom came together now! It was as if their hopes were buried in\r\nseparate graves.\r\n\r\nJurgis, being a man, had troubles of his own. There was another specter\r\nfollowing him. He had never spoken of it, nor would he allow any one\r\nelse to speak of it\xe2\x80\x94he had never acknowledged its existence to himself.\r\nYet the battle with it took all the manhood that he had\xe2\x80\x94and once or\r\ntwice, alas, a little more. Jurgis had discovered drink.\r\n\r\nHe was working in the steaming pit of hell; day after day, week after\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x94until now, there was not an organ of his body that did its work\r\nwithout pain, until the sound of ocean breakers echoed in his head day\r\nand night, and the buildings swayed and danced before him as he went\r\ndown the street. And from all the unending horror of this there was a\r\nrespite, a deliverance\xe2\x80\x94he could drink! He could forget the pain, he\r\ncould slip off the burden; he would see clearly again, he would be\r\nmaster of his brain, of his thoughts, of his will. His dead self would\r\nstir in him, and he would find himself laughing and cracking jokes with\r\nhis companions\xe2\x80\x94he would be a man again, and master of his life.\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy thing for Jurgis to take more than two or three\r\ndrinks. With the first drink he could eat a meal, and he could persuade\r\nhimself that that was economy; with the second he could eat another\r\nmeal\xe2\x80\x94but there would come a time when he could eat no more, and then to\r\npay for a drink was an unthinkable extravagance, a defiance of the\r\nage-long instincts of his hunger-haunted class. One day, however, he\r\ntook the plunge, and drank up all that he had in his pockets, and went\r\nhome half \xe2\x80\x9cpiped,\xe2\x80\x9d as the men phrase it. He was happier than he had\r\nbeen in a year; and yet, because he knew that the happiness would not\r\nlast, he was savage, too with those who would wreck it, and with the\r\nworld, and with his life; and then again, beneath this, he was sick\r\nwith the shame of himself. Afterward, when he saw the despair of his\r\nfamily, and reckoned up the money he had spent, the tears came into his\r\neyes, and he began the long battle with the specter.\r\n\r\nIt was a battle that had no end, that never could have one. But Jurgis\r\ndid not realize that very clearly; he was not given much time for\r\nreflection. He simply knew that he was always fighting. Steeped in\r\nmisery and despair as he was, merely to walk down the street was to be\r\nput upon the rack. There was surely a saloon on the corner\xe2\x80\x94perhaps on\r\nall four corners, and some in the middle of the block as well; and each\r\none stretched out a hand to him each one had a personality of its own,\r\nallurements unlike any other. Going and coming\xe2\x80\x94before sunrise and after\r\ndark\xe2\x80\x94there was warmth and a glow of light, and the steam of hot food,\r\nand perhaps music, or a friendly face, and a word of good cheer. Jurgis\r\ndeveloped a fondness for having Ona on his arm whenever he went out on\r\nthe street, and he would hold her tightly, and walk fast. It was\r\npitiful to have Ona know of this\xe2\x80\x94it drove him wild to think of it; the\r\nthing was not fair, for Ona had never tasted drink, and so could not\r\nunderstand. Sometimes, in desperate hours, he would find himself\r\nwishing that she might learn what it was, so that he need not be\r\nashamed in her presence. They might drink together, and escape from the\r\nhorror\xe2\x80\x94escape for a while, come what would.\r\n\r\nSo there came a time when nearly all the conscious life of Jurgis\r\nconsisted of a struggle with the craving for liquor. He would have ugly\r\nmoods, when he hated Ona and the whole family, because they stood in\r\nhis way. He was a fool to have married; he had tied himself down, had\r\nmade himself a slave. It was all because he was a married man that he\r\nwas compelled to stay in the yards; if it had not been for that he\r\nmight have gone off like Jonas, and to hell with the packers. There\r\nwere few single men in the fertilizer mill\xe2\x80\x94and those few were working\r\nonly for a chance to escape. Meantime, too, they had something to think\r\nabout while they worked,\xe2\x80\x94they had the memory of the last time they had\r\nbeen drunk, and the hope of the time when they would be drunk again. As\r\nfor Jurgis, he was expected to bring home every penny; he could not\r\neven go with the men at noontime\xe2\x80\x94he was supposed to sit down and eat\r\nhis dinner on a pile of fertilizer dust.\r\n\r\nThis was not always his mood, of course; he still loved his family. But\r\njust now was a time of trial. Poor little Antanas, for instance\xe2\x80\x94who had\r\nnever failed to win him with a smile\xe2\x80\x94little Antanas was not smiling\r\njust now, being a mass of fiery red pimples. He had had all the\r\ndiseases that babies are heir to, in quick succession, scarlet fever,\r\nmumps, and whooping cough in the first year, and now he was down with\r\nthe measles. There was no one to attend him but Kotrina; there was no\r\ndoctor to help him, because they were too poor, and children did not\r\ndie of the measles\xe2\x80\x94at least not often. Now and then Kotrina would find\r\ntime to sob over his woes, but for the greater part of the time he had\r\nto be left alone, barricaded upon the bed. The floor was full of\r\ndrafts, and if he caught cold he would die. At night he was tied down,\r\nlest he should kick the covers off him, while the family lay in their\r\nstupor of exhaustion. He would lie and scream for hours, almost in\r\nconvulsions; and then, when he was worn out, he would lie whimpering\r\nand wailing in his torment. He was burning up with fever, and his eyes\r\nwere running sores; in the daytime he was a thing uncanny and impish to\r\nbehold, a plaster of pimples and sweat, a great purple lump of misery.\r\n\r\nYet all this was not really as cruel as it sounds, for, sick as he was,\r\nlittle Antanas was the least unfortunate member of that family. He was\r\nquite able to bear his sufferings\xe2\x80\x94it was as if he had all these\r\ncomplaints to show what a prodigy of health he was. He was the child of\r\nhis parents\xe2\x80\x99 youth and joy; he grew up like the conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s rosebush,\r\nand all the world was his oyster. In general, he toddled around the\r\nkitchen all day with a lean and hungry look\xe2\x80\x94the portion of the family\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nallowance that fell to him was not enough, and he was unrestrainable in\r\nhis demand for more. Antanas was but little over a year old, and\r\nalready no one but his father could manage him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if he had taken all of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s strength\xe2\x80\x94had left\r\nnothing for those that might come after him. Ona was with child again\r\nnow, and it was a dreadful thing to contemplate; even Jurgis, dumb and\r\ndespairing as he was, could not but understand that yet other agonies\r\nwere on the way, and shudder at the thought of them.\r\n\r\nFor Ona was visibly going to pieces. In the first place she was\r\ndeveloping a cough, like the one that had killed old Dede Antanas. She\r\nhad had a trace of it ever since that fatal morning when the greedy\r\nstreetcar corporation had turned her out into the rain; but now it was\r\nbeginning to grow serious, and to wake her up at night. Even worse than\r\nthat was the fearful nervousness from which she suffered; she would\r\nhave frightful headaches and fits of aimless weeping; and sometimes she\r\nwould come home at night shuddering and moaning, and would fling\r\nherself down upon the bed and burst into tears. Several times she was\r\nquite beside herself and hysterical; and then Jurgis would go half-mad\r\nwith fright. Elzbieta would explain to him that it could not be helped,\r\nthat a woman was subject to such things when she was pregnant; but he\r\nwas hardly to be persuaded, and would beg and plead to know what had\r\nhappened. She had never been like this before, he would argue\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nmonstrous and unthinkable. It was the life she had to live, the\r\naccursed work she had to do, that was killing her by inches. She was\r\nnot fitted for it\xe2\x80\x94no woman was fitted for it, no woman ought to be\r\nallowed to do such work; if the world could not keep them alive any\r\nother way it ought to kill them at once and be done with it. They ought\r\nnot to marry, to have children; no workingman ought to marry\xe2\x80\x94if he,\r\nJurgis, had known what a woman was like, he would have had his eyes\r\ntorn out first. So he would carry on, becoming half hysterical himself,\r\nwhich was an unbearable thing to see in a big man; Ona would pull\r\nherself together and fling herself into his arms, begging him to stop,\r\nto be still, that she would be better, it would be all right. So she\r\nwould lie and sob out her grief upon his shoulder, while he gazed at\r\nher, as helpless as a wounded animal, the target of unseen enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of these perplexing things was in the summer; and each\r\ntime Ona would promise him with terror in her voice that it would not\r\nhappen again\xe2\x80\x94but in vain. Each crisis would leave Jurgis more and more\r\nfrightened, more disposed to distrust Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s consolations, and to\r\nbelieve that there was some terrible thing about all this that he was\r\nnot allowed to know. Once or twice in these outbreaks he caught Ona\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye, and it seemed to him like the eye of a hunted animal; there were\r\nbroken phrases of anguish and despair now and then, amid her frantic\r\nweeping. It was only because he was so numb and beaten himself that\r\nJurgis did not worry more about this. But he never thought of it,\r\nexcept when he was dragged to it\xe2\x80\x94he lived like a dumb beast of burden,\r\nknowing only the moment in which he was.\r\n\r\nThe winter was coming on again, more menacing and cruel than ever. It\r\nwas October, and the holiday rush had begun. It was necessary for the\r\npacking machines to grind till late at night to provide food that would\r\nbe eaten at Christmas breakfasts; and Marija and Elzbieta and Ona, as\r\npart of the machine, began working fifteen or sixteen hours a day.\r\nThere was no choice about this\xe2\x80\x94whatever work there was to be done they\r\nhad to do, if they wished to keep their places; besides that, it added\r\nanother pittance to their incomes. So they staggered on with the awful\r\nload. They would start work every morning at seven, and eat their\r\ndinners at noon, and then work until ten or eleven at night without\r\nanother mouthful of food. Jurgis wanted to wait for them, to help them\r\nhome at night, but they would not think of this; the fertilizer mill\r\nwas not running overtime, and there was no place for him to wait save\r\nin a saloon. Each would stagger out into the darkness, and make her way\r\nto the corner, where they met; or if the others had already gone, would\r\nget into a car, and begin a painful struggle to keep awake. When they\r\ngot home they were always too tired either to eat or to undress; they\r\nwould crawl into bed with their shoes on, and lie like logs. If they\r\nshould fail, they would certainly be lost; if they held out, they might\r\nhave enough coal for the winter.\r\n\r\nA day or two before Thanksgiving Day there came a snowstorm. It began\r\nin the afternoon, and by evening two inches had fallen. Jurgis tried to\r\nwait for the women, but went into a saloon to get warm, and took two\r\ndrinks, and came out and ran home to escape from the demon; there he\r\nlay down to wait for them, and instantly fell asleep. When he opened\r\nhis eyes again he was in the midst of a nightmare, and found Elzbieta\r\nshaking him and crying out. At first he could not realize what she was\r\nsaying\xe2\x80\x94Ona had not come home. What time was it, he asked. It was\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94time to be up. Ona had not been home that night! And it was\r\nbitter cold, and a foot of snow on the ground.\r\n\r\nJurgis sat up with a start. Marija was crying with fright and the\r\nchildren were wailing in sympathy\xe2\x80\x94little Stanislovas in addition,\r\nbecause the terror of the snow was upon him. Jurgis had nothing to put\r\non but his shoes and his coat, and in half a minute he was out of the\r\ndoor. Then, however, he realized that there was no need of haste, that\r\nhe had no idea where to go. It was still dark as midnight, and the\r\nthick snowflakes were sifting down\xe2\x80\x94everything was so silent that he\r\ncould hear the rustle of them as they fell. In the few seconds that he\r\nstood there hesitating he was covered white.\r\n\r\nHe set off at a run for the yards, stopping by the way to inquire in\r\nthe saloons that were open. Ona might have been overcome on the way; or\r\nelse she might have met with an accident in the machines. When he got\r\nto the place where she worked he inquired of one of the watchmen\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nhad not been any accident, so far as the man had heard. At the time\r\noffice, which he found already open, the clerk told him that Ona\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheck had been turned in the night before, showing that she had left\r\nher work.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was nothing for him to do but wait, pacing back and\r\nforth in the snow, meantime, to keep from freezing. Already the yards\r\nwere full of activity; cattle were being unloaded from the cars in the\r\ndistance, and across the way the \xe2\x80\x9cbeef-luggers\xe2\x80\x9d were toiling in the\r\ndarkness, carrying two-hundred-pound quarters of bullocks into the\r\nrefrigerator cars. Before the first streaks of daylight there came the\r\ncrowding throngs of workingmen, shivering, and swinging their dinner\r\npails as they hurried by. Jurgis took up his stand by the time-office\r\nwindow, where alone there was light enough for him to see; the snow\r\nfell so quick that it was only by peering closely that he could make\r\nsure that Ona did not pass him.\r\n\r\nSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock came, the hour when the great packing machine began to\r\nmove. Jurgis ought to have been at his place in the fertilizer mill;\r\nbut instead he was waiting, in an agony of fear, for Ona. It was\r\nfifteen minutes after the hour when he saw a form emerge from the snow\r\nmist, and sprang toward it with a cry. It was she, running swiftly; as\r\nshe saw him, she staggered forward, and half fell into his outstretched\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has been the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was several seconds before she could get breath to answer him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get home,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe snow\xe2\x80\x94the cars had stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where were you then?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to go home with a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwith Jadvyga.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis drew a deep breath; but then he noticed that she was sobbing and\r\ntrembling\xe2\x80\x94as if in one of those nervous crises that he dreaded so. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jurgis, I was so frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clinging to him wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been so worried!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were near the time station window, and people were staring at\r\nthem. Jurgis led her away. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid\xe2\x80\x94I was just afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Ona. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere I was, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you might do. I tried to get home,\r\nbut I was so tired. Oh, Jurgis, Jurgis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was so glad to get her back that he could not think clearly about\r\nanything else. It did not seem strange to him that she should be so\r\nvery much upset; all her fright and incoherent protestations did not\r\nmatter since he had her back. He let her cry away her tears; and then,\r\nbecause it was nearly eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and they would lose another hour\r\nif they delayed, he left her at the packing house door, with her\r\nghastly white face and her haunted eyes of terror.\r\n\r\nThere was another brief interval. Christmas was almost come; and\r\nbecause the snow still held, and the searching cold, morning after\r\nmorning Jurgis half carried his wife to her post, staggering with her\r\nthrough the darkness; until at last, one night, came the end.\r\n\r\nIt lacked but three days of the holidays. About midnight Marija and\r\nElzbieta came home, exclaiming in alarm when they found that Ona had\r\nnot come. The two had agreed to meet her; and, after waiting, had gone\r\nto the room where she worked; only to find that the ham-wrapping girls\r\nhad quit work an hour before, and left. There was no snow that night,\r\nnor was it especially cold; and still Ona had not come! Something more\r\nserious must be wrong this time.\r\n\r\nThey aroused Jurgis, and he sat up and listened crossly to the story.\r\nShe must have gone home again with Jadvyga, he said; Jadvyga lived only\r\ntwo blocks from the yards, and perhaps she had been tired. Nothing\r\ncould have happened to her\xe2\x80\x94and even if there had, there was nothing\r\ncould be done about it until morning. Jurgis turned over in his bed,\r\nand was snoring again before the two had closed the door.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, however, he was up and out nearly an hour before the\r\nusual time. Jadvyga Marcinkus lived on the other side of the yards,\r\nbeyond Halsted Street, with her mother and sisters, in a single\r\nbasement room\xe2\x80\x94for Mikolas had recently lost one hand from blood\r\npoisoning, and their marriage had been put off forever. The door of the\r\nroom was in the rear, reached by a narrow court, and Jurgis saw a light\r\nin the window and heard something frying as he passed; he knocked, half\r\nexpecting that Ona would answer.\r\n\r\nInstead there was one of Jadvyga\xe2\x80\x99s little sisters, who gazed at him\r\nthrough a crack in the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Ona?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded; and the child\r\nlooked at him in perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cOna?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t she here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child, and Jurgis gave a start. A moment later came\r\nJadvyga, peering over the child\xe2\x80\x99s head. When she saw who it was, she\r\nslid around out of sight, for she was not quite dressed. Jurgis must\r\nexcuse her, she began, her mother was very ill\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOna isn\xe2\x80\x99t here?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis demanded, too alarmed to wait for her to\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jadvyga. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you think she would be here? Had\r\nshe said she was coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come home\xe2\x80\x94and I thought she would be\r\nhere the same as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs before?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Jadvyga, in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time she spent the night here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be some mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cOna has never\r\nspent the night here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was only half able to realize the words. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo weeks ago. Jadvyga! She told me so the night it snowed, and she\r\ncould not get home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be some mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the girl, again; \xe2\x80\x9cshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe steadied himself by the door-sill; and Jadvyga in her anxiety\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nshe was fond of Ona\xe2\x80\x94opened the door wide, holding her jacket across her\r\nthroat. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you didn\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand her?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nmust have meant somewhere else. She\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said here,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me all about you, and how\r\nyou were, and what you said. Are you sure? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten? You\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94and then came a peevish voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJadvyga, you are\r\ngiving the baby a cold. Shut the door!\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis stood for half a minute\r\nmore, stammering his perplexity through an eighth of an inch of crack;\r\nand then, as there was really nothing more to be said, he excused\r\nhimself and went away.\r\n\r\nHe walked on half dazed, without knowing where he went. Ona had\r\ndeceived him! She had lied to him! And what could it mean\xe2\x80\x94where had she\r\nbeen? Where was she now? He could hardly grasp the thing\xe2\x80\x94much less try\r\nto solve it; but a hundred wild surmises came to him, a sense of\r\nimpending calamity overwhelmed him.\r\n\r\nBecause there was nothing else to do, he went back to the time office\r\nto watch again. He waited until nearly an hour after seven, and then\r\nwent to the room where Ona worked to make inquiries of Ona\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cforelady.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cforelady,\xe2\x80\x9d he found, had not yet come; all the lines\r\nof cars that came from downtown were stalled\xe2\x80\x94there had been an accident\r\nin the powerhouse, and no cars had been running since last night.\r\nMeantime, however, the ham-wrappers were working away, with some one\r\nelse in charge of them. The girl who answered Jurgis was busy, and as\r\nshe talked she looked to see if she were being watched. Then a man came\r\nup, wheeling a truck; he knew Jurgis for Ona\xe2\x80\x99s husband, and was curious\r\nabout the mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the cars had something to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmaybe she\r\nhad gone down-town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cshe never went down-town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. Jurgis thought he saw him exchange a swift\r\nglance with the girl as he spoke, and he demanded quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nknow about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the man had seen that the boss was watching him; he started on\r\nagain, pushing his truck. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nover his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know where your wife goes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Jurgis went out again and paced up and down before the building.\r\nAll the morning he stayed there, with no thought of his work. About\r\nnoon he went to the police station to make inquiries, and then came\r\nback again for another anxious vigil. Finally, toward the middle of the\r\nafternoon, he set out for home once more.\r\n\r\nHe was walking out Ashland Avenue. The streetcars had begun running\r\nagain, and several passed him, packed to the steps with people. The\r\nsight of them set Jurgis to thinking again of the man\xe2\x80\x99s sarcastic\r\nremark; and half involuntarily he found himself watching the cars\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe result that he gave a sudden startled exclamation, and stopped\r\nshort in his tracks.\r\n\r\nThen he broke into a run. For a whole block he tore after the car, only\r\na little ways behind. That rusty black hat with the drooping red\r\nflower, it might not be Ona\xe2\x80\x99s, but there was very little likelihood of\r\nit. He would know for certain very soon, for she would get out two\r\nblocks ahead. He slowed down, and let the car go on.\r\n\r\nShe got out: and as soon as she was out of sight on the side street\r\nJurgis broke into a run. Suspicion was rife in him now, and he was not\r\nashamed to shadow her: he saw her turn the corner near their home, and\r\nthen he ran again, and saw her as she went up the porch steps of the\r\nhouse. After that he turned back, and for five minutes paced up and\r\ndown, his hands clenched tightly and his lips set, his mind in a\r\nturmoil. Then he went home and entered.\r\n\r\nAs he opened the door, he saw Elzbieta, who had also been looking for\r\nOna, and had come home again. She was now on tiptoe, and had a finger\r\non her lips. Jurgis waited until she was close to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make any noise,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOna is asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen very ill. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid her mind\xe2\x80\x99s been wandering, Jurgis. She was\r\nlost on the street all night, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve only just succeeded in getting\r\nher quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did she come in?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon after you left this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elzbieta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has she been out since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of course not. She\xe2\x80\x99s so weak, Jurgis, she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he set his teeth hard together. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are lying to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nElzbieta started, and turned pale. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Jurgis did not answer. He pushed her aside, and strode to the\r\nbedroom door and opened it.\r\n\r\nOna was sitting on the bed. She turned a startled look upon him as he\r\nentered. He closed the door in Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s face, and went toward his\r\nwife. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\nShe had her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and he saw that her face\r\nwas as white as paper, and drawn with pain. She gasped once or twice as\r\nshe tried to answer him, and then began, speaking low, and swiftly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJurgis, I\xe2\x80\x94I think I have been out of my mind. I started to come last\r\nnight, and I could not find the way. I walked\xe2\x80\x94I walked all night, I\r\nthink, and\xe2\x80\x94and I only got home\xe2\x80\x94this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needed a rest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a hard tone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you go out\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking her fairly in the face, and he could read the sudden\r\nfear and wild uncertainty that leaped into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I had to go\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94to the store,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, almost in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cI had to go\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are lying to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis. Then he clenched his hands and took\r\na step toward her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you lie to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nare you doing that you have to lie to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJurgis!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, starting up in fright. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jurgis, how can\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have lied to me, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told me you had been to\r\nJadvyga\xe2\x80\x99s house that other night, and you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. You had been where\r\nyou were last night\xe2\x80\x94somewheres downtown, for I saw you get off the car.\r\nWhere were you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if he had struck a knife into her. She seemed to go all to\r\npieces. For half a second she stood, reeling and swaying, staring at\r\nhim with horror in her eyes; then, with a cry of anguish, she tottered\r\nforward, stretching out her arms to him. But he stepped aside,\r\ndeliberately, and let her fall. She caught herself at the side of the\r\nbed, and then sank down, burying her face in her hands and bursting\r\ninto frantic weeping.\r\n\r\nThere came one of those hysterical crises that had so often dismayed\r\nhim. Ona sobbed and wept, her fear and anguish building themselves up\r\ninto long climaxes. Furious gusts of emotion would come sweeping over\r\nher, shaking her as the tempest shakes the trees upon the hills; all\r\nher frame would quiver and throb with them\xe2\x80\x94it was as if some dreadful\r\nthing rose up within her and took possession of her, torturing her,\r\ntearing her. This thing had been wont to set Jurgis quite beside\r\nhimself; but now he stood with his lips set tightly and his hands\r\nclenched\xe2\x80\x94she might weep till she killed herself, but she should not\r\nmove him this time\xe2\x80\x94not an inch, not an inch. Because the sounds she\r\nmade set his blood to running cold and his lips to quivering in spite\r\nof himself, he was glad of the diversion when Teta Elzbieta, pale with\r\nfright, opened the door and rushed in; yet he turned upon her with an\r\noath. \xe2\x80\x9cGo out!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cgo out!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, as she stood hesitating,\r\nabout to speak, he seized her by the arm, and half flung her from the\r\nroom, slamming the door and barring it with a table. Then he turned\r\nagain and faced Ona, crying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow, answer me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet she did not hear him\xe2\x80\x94she was still in the grip of the fiend. Jurgis\r\ncould see her outstretched hands, shaking and twitching, roaming here\r\nand there over the bed at will, like living things; he could see\r\nconvulsive shudderings start in her body and run through her limbs. She\r\nwas sobbing and choking\xe2\x80\x94it was as if there were too many sounds for one\r\nthroat, they came chasing each other, like waves upon the sea. Then her\r\nvoice would begin to rise into screams, louder and louder until it\r\nbroke in wild, horrible peals of laughter. Jurgis bore it until he\r\ncould bear it no longer, and then he sprang at her, seizing her by the\r\nshoulders and shaking her, shouting into her ear: \xe2\x80\x9cStop it, I say! Stop\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, out of her agony; then she fell forward at his\r\nfeet. She caught them in her hands, in spite of his efforts to step\r\naside, and with her face upon the floor lay writhing. It made a choking\r\nin Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 throat to hear her, and he cried again, more savagely than\r\nbefore: \xe2\x80\x9cStop it, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time she heeded him, and caught her breath and lay silent, save\r\nfor the gasping sobs that wrenched all her frame. For a long minute she\r\nlay there, perfectly motionless, until a cold fear seized her husband,\r\nthinking that she was dying. Suddenly, however, he heard her voice,\r\nfaintly: \xe2\x80\x9cJurgis! Jurgis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe had to bend down to her, she was so weak. She was pleading with him,\r\nin broken phrases, painfully uttered: \xe2\x80\x9cHave faith in me! Believe me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve what?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve that I\xe2\x80\x94that I know best\xe2\x80\x94that I love you! And do not ask\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94what you did. Oh, Jurgis, please, please! It is for the best\xe2\x80\x94it is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started to speak again, but she rushed on frantically, heading him\r\noff. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will only do it! If you will only\xe2\x80\x94only believe me! It\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it\xe2\x80\x94it will be all right\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94it is no harm. Oh, Jurgis\xe2\x80\x94please, please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had hold of him, and was trying to raise herself to look at him; he\r\ncould feel the palsied shaking of her hands and the heaving of the\r\nbosom she pressed against him. She managed to catch one of his hands\r\nand gripped it convulsively, drawing it to her face, and bathing it in\r\nher tears. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, believe me, believe me!\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed again; and he\r\nshouted in fury, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut still she clung to him, wailing aloud in her despair: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jurgis,\r\nthink what you are doing! It will ruin us\xe2\x80\x94it will ruin us! Oh, no, you\r\nmust not do it! No, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. You must not do it! It will\r\ndrive me mad\xe2\x80\x94it will kill me\xe2\x80\x94no, no, Jurgis, I am crazy\xe2\x80\x94it is nothing.\r\nYou do not really need to know. We can be happy\xe2\x80\x94we can love each other\r\njust the same. Oh, please, please, believe me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer words fairly drove him wild. He tore his hands loose, and flung her\r\noff. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cGod damn it, I say\xe2\x80\x94answer me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sank down upon the floor, beginning to cry again. It was like\r\nlistening to the moan of a damned soul, and Jurgis could not stand it.\r\nHe smote his fist upon the table by his side, and shouted again at her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to scream aloud, her voice like the voice of some wild beast:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Ah! I can\xe2\x80\x99t! I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sprang and caught her by the arm, lifting her up, and glaring into\r\nher face. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me where you were last night!\xe2\x80\x9d he panted. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick, out\r\nwith it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she began to whisper, one word at a time: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94was in\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94downtown\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat house? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to hide her eyes away, but he held her. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. He did not understand at first. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed. And then suddenly, as in an explosion, the horrible\r\ntruth burst over him, and he reeled and staggered back with a scream.\r\nHe caught himself against the wall, and put his hand to his forehead,\r\nstaring about him, and whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cJesus! Jesus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn instant later he leaped at her, as she lay groveling at his feet. He\r\nseized her by the throat. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped, hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick! Who\r\ntook you to that place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to get away, making him furious; he thought it was fear, of\r\nthe pain of his clutch\xe2\x80\x94he did not understand that it was the agony of\r\nher shame. Still she answered him, \xe2\x80\x9cConnor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConnor,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is Connor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boss,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tightened his grip, in his frenzy, and only when he saw her eyes\r\nclosing did he realize that he was choking her. Then he relaxed his\r\nfingers, and crouched, waiting, until she opened her lids again. His\r\nbreath beat hot into her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, at last, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lay perfectly motionless, and he had to hold his breath to catch\r\nher words. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not want\xe2\x80\x94to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI tried\xe2\x80\x94I tried not to\r\ndo it. I only did it\xe2\x80\x94to save us. It was our only chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, for a space, there was no sound but his panting. Ona\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nclosed and when she spoke again she did not open them. \xe2\x80\x9cHe told me\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwould have me turned off. He told me he would\xe2\x80\x94we would all of us lose\r\nour places. We could never get anything to do\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x94again. He\xe2\x80\x94he meant\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94he would have ruined us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis\xe2\x80\x99 arms were shaking so that he could scarcely hold himself up,\r\nand lurched forward now and then as he listened. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\xe2\x80\x94when did this\r\nbegin?\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the very first,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She spoke as if in a trance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94it was their plot\xe2\x80\x94Miss Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s plot. She hated me. And he\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwanted me. He used to speak to me\xe2\x80\x94out on the platform. Then he began\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94to make love to me. He offered me money. He begged me\xe2\x80\x94he said he\r\nloved me. Then he threatened me. He knew all about us, he knew we would\r\nstarve. He knew your boss\xe2\x80\x94he knew Marija\xe2\x80\x99s. He would hound us to death,\r\nhe said\xe2\x80\x94then he said if I would\xe2\x80\x94if I\xe2\x80\x94we would all of us be sure of\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94always. Then one day he caught hold of me\xe2\x80\x94he would not let\r\ngo\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the hallway\xe2\x80\x94at night\xe2\x80\x94after every one had gone. I could not help it.\r\nI thought of you\xe2\x80\x94of the baby\xe2\x80\x94of mother and the children. I was afraid\r\nof him\xe2\x80\x94afraid to cry out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment ago her face had been ashen gray, now it was scarlet. She was\r\nbeginning to breathe hard again. Jurgis made not a sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was two months ago. Then he wanted me to come\xe2\x80\x94to that house. He\r\nwanted me to stay there. He said all of us\xe2\x80\x94that we would not have to\r\nwork. He made me come there\xe2\x80\x94in the evenings. I told you\xe2\x80\x94you thought I\r\nwas at the factory. Then\xe2\x80\x94one night it snowed, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get back.\r\nAnd last night\xe2\x80\x94the cars were stopped. It was such a little thing\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nruin us all. I tried to walk, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to\r\nknow. It would have\xe2\x80\x94it would have been all right. We could have gone\r\non\xe2\x80\x94just the same\xe2\x80\x94you need never have known about it. He was getting\r\ntired of me\xe2\x80\x94he would have let me alone soon. I am going to have a\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x94I am getting ugly. He told me that\xe2\x80\x94twice, he told me, last night.\r\nHe kicked me\xe2\x80\x94last night\xe2\x80\x94too. And now you will kill him\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94you will\r\nkill him\xe2\x80\x94and we shall die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this she had said without a quiver; she lay still as death, not an\r\neyelid moving. And Jurgis, too, said not a word. He lifted himself by\r\nthe bed, and stood up. He did not stop for another glance at her, but\r\nwent to the door and opened it. He did not see Elzbieta, crouching\r\nterrified in the corner. He went out, hatless, leaving the street door\r\nopen behind him. The instant his feet were on the sidewalk he broke\r\ninto a run.\r\n\r\nHe ran like one possessed, blindly, furiously, looking neither to the\r\nright nor left. He was on Ashland Avenue before exhaustion compelled\r\nhim to slow down, and then, noticing a car, he made a dart for it and\r\ndrew himself aboard. His eyes were wild and his hair flying, and he was\r\nbreathing hoarsely, like a wounded bull; but the people on the car did\r\nnot notice this particularly\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it seemed natural to them that a\r\nman who smelled as Jurgis smelled should exhibit an aspect to\r\ncorrespond. They began to give way before him as usual. The conductor\r\ntook his nickel gingerly, with the tips of his fingers, and then left\r\nhim with the platform to himself. Jurgis did not even notice it\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nthoughts were far away. Within his soul it was like a roaring furnace;\r\nhe stood waiting, waiting, crouching as if for a spring.\r\n\r\nHe had some of his breath back when the car came to the entrance of the\r\nyards, and so he leaped off and started again, racing at full speed.\r\nPeople turned and stared at him, but he saw no one\xe2\x80\x94there was the\r\nfactory, and he bounded through the doorway and down the corridor. He\r\nknew the room where Ona worked, and he knew Connor, the boss of the\r\nloading-gang outside. He looked for the man as he sprang into the room.\r\n\r\nThe truckmen were hard at work, loading the freshly packed boxes and\r\nbarrels upon the cars. Jurgis shot one swift glance up and down the\r\nplatform\xe2\x80\x94the man was not on it. But then suddenly he heard a voice in\r\nthe corridor, and started for it with a bound. In an instant more he\r\nfronted the boss.\r\n\r\nHe was a big, red-faced Irishman, coarse-featured, and smelling of\r\nliquor. He saw Jurgis as he crossed the threshold, and turned white. He\r\nhesitated one second, as if meaning to run; and in the next his\r\nassailant was upon him. He put up his hands to protect his face, but\r\nJurgis, lunging with all the power of his arm and body, struck him\r\nfairly between the eyes and knocked him backward. The next moment he\r\nwas on top of him, burying his fingers in his throat.\r\n\r\nTo Jurgis this man\xe2\x80\x99s whole presence reeked of the crime he had\r\ncommitted; the touch of his body was madness to him\xe2\x80\x94it set every nerve\r\nof him a-tremble, it aroused all the demon in his soul. It had worked\r\nits will upon Ona, this great beast\xe2\x80\x94and now he had it, he had it! It\r\nwas his turn now! Things swam blood before him, and he screamed aloud\r\nin his fury, lifting his victim and smashing his head upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThe place, of course, was in an uproar; women fainting and shrieking,\r\nand men rushing in. Jurgis was so bent upon his task that he knew\r\nnothing of this, and scarcely realized that people were trying to\r\ninterfere with him; it was only when half a dozen men had seized him by\r\nthe legs and shoulders and were pulling at him, that he understood that\r\nhe was losing his prey. In a flash he had bent down and sunk his teeth\r\ninto the man\xe2\x80\x99s cheek; and when they tore him away he was dripping with\r\nblood, and little ribbons of skin were hanging in his mouth.\r\n\r\nThey got him down upon the floor, clinging to him by his arms and legs,\r\nand still they could hardly hold him. He fought like a tiger, writhing\r\nand twisting, half flinging them off, and starting toward his\r\nunconscious enemy. But yet others rushed in, until there was a little\r\nmountain of twisted limbs and bodies, heaving and tossing, and working\r\nits way about the room. In the end, by their sheer weight, they choked\r\nthe breath out of him, and then they carried him to the company police\r\nstation, where he lay still until they had summoned a patrol wagon to\r\ntake him away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jurgis got up again he went quietly enough. He was exhausted and\r\nhalf-dazed, and besides he saw the blue uniforms of the policemen. He\r\ndrove in a patrol wagon with half a dozen of them watching him; keeping\r\nas far away as possible, however, on account of the fertilizer. Then he\r\nstood before the sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s desk and gave his name and address, and saw\r\na charge of assault and battery entered against him. On his way to his\r\ncell a burly policeman cursed him because he started down the wrong\r\ncorridor, and then added a kick when he was not quick enough;\r\nnevertheless, Jurgis did not even lift his eyes\xe2\x80\x94he had lived two years\r\nand a half in Packingtown, and he knew what the police were. It was as\r\nmuch as a man\xe2\x80\x99s very life was worth to anger them, here in their inmost\r\nlair; like as not a dozen would pile on to him at once, and pound his\r\nface into a pulp. It would be nothing unusual if he got his skull\r\ncracked in the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x94in which case they would report that he had been\r\ndrunk and had fallen down, and there would be no one to know the\r\ndifference or to care.\r\n\r\nSo a barred door clanged upon Jurgis and he sat down upon a bench and\r\nburied his face in his hands. He was alone; he had the afternoon and\r\nall of the night to himself.\r\n\r\nAt first he was like a wild beast that has glutted itself; he was in a\r\ndull stupor of satisfaction. He had done up the scoundrel pretty\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94not as well as he would have if they had given him a minute more,\r\nbut pretty well, all the same; the ends of his fingers were still\r\ntingling from their contact with the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s throat. But then, little\r\nby little, as his strength came back and his senses cleared, he began\r\nto see beyond his momentary gratification; that he had nearly killed\r\nthe boss would not help Ona\xe2\x80\x94not the horrors that she had borne, nor the\r\nmemory that would haunt her all her days. It would not help to feed her\r\nand her child; she would certainly lose her place, while he\xe2\x80\x94what was to\r\nhappen to him God only knew.\r\n\r\nHalf the night he paced the floor, wrestling with this nightmare; and\r\nwhen he was exhausted he lay down, trying to sleep, but finding\r\ninstead, for the first time in his life, that his brain was too much\r\nfor him. In the cell next to him was a drunken wife-beater and in the\r\none beyond a yelling maniac. At midnight they opened the station house\r\nto the homeless wanderers who were crowded about the door, shivering in\r\nthe winter blast, and they thronged into the corridor outside of the\r\ncells. Some of them stretched themselves out on the bare stone floor\r\nand fell to snoring, others sat up, laughing and talking, cursing and\r\nquarreling. The air was fetid with their breath, yet in spite of this\r\nsome of them smelled Jurgis and called down the torments of hell upon\r\nhim, while he lay in a far corner of his cell, counting the throbbings\r\nof the blood in his forehead.\r\n\r\nThey had brought him his supper, which was \xe2\x80\x9cduffers and dope\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94being\r\nhunks of dry bread on a tin plate, and coffee, called \xe2\x80\x9cdope\xe2\x80\x9d because it\r\nwas drugged to keep the prisoners quiet. Jurgis had not known this, or\r\nhe would have swallowed the stuff in desperation; as it was, every\r\nnerve of him was a-quiver with shame and rage. Toward morning the place\r\nfell silent, and he got up and began to pace his cell; and then within\r\nthe soul of him there rose up a fiend, red-eyed and cruel, and tore out\r\nthe strings of his heart.\r\n\r\nIt was not for himself that he suffered\xe2\x80\x94what did a man who worked in\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s fertilizer mill care about anything that the world might do to\r\nhim! What was any tyranny of prison compared with the tyranny of the\r\npast, of the thing that had happened and could not be recalled, of the\r\nmemory that could never be effaced! The horror of it drove him mad; he\r\nstretched out his arms to heaven, crying out for deliverance from\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and there was no deliverance, there was no power even in heaven that\r\ncould undo the past. It was a ghost that would not drown; it followed\r\nhim, it seized upon him and beat him to the ground. Ah, if only he\r\ncould have foreseen it\xe2\x80\x94but then, he would have foreseen it, if he had\r\nnot been a fool! He smote his hands upon his forehead, cursing himself\r\nbecause he had ever allowed Ona to work where she had, because he had\r\nnot stood between her and a fate which every one knew to be so common.\r\nHe should have taken her away, even if it were to lie down and die of\r\nstarvation in the gutters of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s streets! And now\xe2\x80\x94oh, it could\r\nnot be true; it was too monstrous, too horrible.\r\n\r\nIt was a thing that could not be faced; a new shuddering seized him\r\nevery time he tried to think of it. No, there was no bearing the load\r\nof it, there was no living under it. There would be none for her\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nknew that he might pardon her, might plead with her on his knees, but\r\nshe would never look him in the face again, she would never be his wife\r\nagain. The shame of it would kill her\xe2\x80\x94there could be no other\r\ndeliverance, and it was best that she should die.\r\n\r\nThis was simple and clear, and yet, with cruel inconsistency, whenever\r\nhe escaped from this nightmare it was to suffer and cry out at the\r\nvision of Ona starving. They had put him in jail, and they would keep\r\nhim here a long time, years maybe. And Ona would surely not go to work\r\nagain, broken and crushed as she was. And Elzbieta and Marija, too,\r\nmight lose their places\xe2\x80\x94if that hell fiend Connor chose to set to work\r\nto ruin them, they would all be turned out. And even if he did not,\r\nthey could not live\xe2\x80\x94even if the boys left school again, they could\r\nsurely not pay all the bills without him and Ona. They had only a few\r\ndollars now\xe2\x80\x94they had just paid the rent of the house a week ago, and\r\nthat after it was two weeks overdue. So it would be due again in a\r\nweek! They would have no money to pay it then\xe2\x80\x94and they would lose the\r\nhouse, after all their long, heartbreaking struggle. Three times now\r\nthe agent had warned him that he would not tolerate another delay.\r\nPerhaps it was very base of Jurgis to be thinking about the house when\r\nhe had the other unspeakable thing to fill his mind; yet, how much he\r\nhad suffered for this house, how much they had all of them suffered! It\r\nwas their one hope of respite, as long as they lived; they had put all\r\ntheir money into it\xe2\x80\x94and they were working people, poor people, whose\r\nmoney was their strength, the very substance of them, body and soul,\r\nthe thing by which they lived and for lack of which they died.\r\n\r\nAnd they would lose it all; they would be turned out into the streets,\r\nand have to hide in some icy garret, and live or die as best they\r\ncould! Jurgis had all the night\xe2\x80\x94and all of many more nights\xe2\x80\x94to think\r\nabout this, and he saw the thing in its details; he lived it all, as if\r\nhe were there. They would sell their furniture, and then run into debt\r\nat the stores, and then be refused credit; they would borrow a little\r\nfrom the Szedvilases, whose delicatessen store was tottering on the\r\nbrink of ruin; the neighbors would come and help them a little\xe2\x80\x94poor,\r\nsick Jadvyga would bring a few spare pennies, as she always did when\r\npeople were starving, and Tamoszius Kuszleika would bring them the\r\nproceeds of a night\xe2\x80\x99s fiddling. So they would struggle to hang on until\r\nhe got out of jail\xe2\x80\x94or would they know that he was in jail, would they\r\nbe able to find out anything about him? Would they be allowed to see\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94or was it to be part of his punishment to be kept in ignorance\r\nabout their fate?\r\n\r\nHis mind would hang upon the worst possibilities; he saw Ona ill and\r\ntortured, Marija out of her place, little Stanislovas unable to get to\r\nwork for the snow, the whole family turned out on the street. God\r\nAlmighty! would they actually let them lie down in the street and die?\r\nWould there be no help even then\xe2\x80\x94would they wander about in the snow\r\ntill they froze? Jurgis had never seen any dead bodies in the streets,\r\nbut he had seen people evicted and disappear, no one knew where; and\r\nthough the city had a relief bureau, though there was a charity\r\norganization society in the stockyards district, in all his life there\r\nhe had never heard of either of them. They did not advertise their\r\nactivities, having more calls than they could attend to without that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So on until morning. Then he had another ride in the patrol wagon,\r\nalong with the drunken wife-beater and the maniac, several \xe2\x80\x9cplain\r\ndrunks\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csaloon fighters,\xe2\x80\x9d a burglar, and two men who had been\r\narrested for stealing meat from the packing houses. Along with them he\r\nwas driven into a large, white-walled room, stale-smelling and crowded.\r\nIn front, upon a raised platform behind a rail, sat a stout,\r\nflorid-faced personage, with a nose broken out in purple blotches.\r\n\r\nOur friend realized vaguely that he was about to be tried. He wondered\r\nwhat for\xe2\x80\x94whether or not his victim might be dead, and if so, what they\r\nwould do with him. Hang him, perhaps, or beat him to death\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nwould have surprised Jurgis, who knew little of the laws. Yet he had\r\npicked up gossip enough to have it occur to him that the loud-voiced\r\nman upon the bench might be the notorious Justice Callahan, about whom\r\nthe people of Packingtown spoke with bated breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPat\xe2\x80\x9d Callahan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGrowler\xe2\x80\x9d Pat, as he had been known before he ascended\r\nthe bench\xe2\x80\x94had begun life as a butcher boy and a bruiser of local\r\nreputation; he had gone into politics almost as soon as he had learned\r\nto talk, and had held two offices at once before he was old enough to\r\nvote. If Scully was the thumb, Pat Callahan was the first finger of the\r\nunseen hand whereby the packers held down the people of the district.\r\nNo politician in Chicago ranked higher in their confidence; he had been\r\nat it a long time\xe2\x80\x94had been the business agent in the city council of\r\nold Durham, the self-made merchant, way back in the early days, when\r\nthe whole city of Chicago had been up at auction. \xe2\x80\x9cGrowler\xe2\x80\x9d Pat had\r\ngiven up holding city offices very early in his career\xe2\x80\x94caring only for\r\nparty power, and giving the rest of his time to superintending his\r\ndives and brothels. Of late years, however, since his children were\r\ngrowing up, he had begun to value respectability, and had had himself\r\nmade a magistrate; a position for which he was admirably fitted,\r\nbecause of his strong conservatism and his contempt for \xe2\x80\x9cforeigners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis sat gazing about the room for an hour or two; he was in hopes\r\nthat some one of the family would come, but in this he was\r\ndisappointed. Finally, he was led before the bar, and a lawyer for the\r\ncompany appeared against him. Connor was under the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s care, the\r\nlawyer explained briefly, and if his Honor would hold the prisoner for\r\na week\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Honor, promptly.\r\n\r\nJurgis was staring from the judge to the lawyer in perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou any one to go on your bond?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the judge, and then a clerk\r\nwho stood at Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 elbow explained to him what this meant. The latter\r\nshook his head, and before he realized what had happened the policemen\r\nwere leading him away again. They took him to a room where other\r\nprisoners were waiting and here he stayed until court adjourned, when\r\nhe had another long and bitterly cold ride in a patrol wagon to the\r\ncounty jail, which is on the north side of the city, and nine or ten\r\nmiles from the stockyards.\r\n\r\nHere they searched Jurgis, leaving him only his money, which consisted\r\nof fifteen cents. Then they led him to a room and told him to strip for\r\na bath; after which he had to walk down a long gallery, past the grated\r\ncell doors of the inmates of the jail. This was a great event to the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x94the daily review of the new arrivals, all stark naked, and many\r\nand diverting were the comments. Jurgis was required to stay in the\r\nbath longer than any one, in the vain hope of getting out of him a few\r\nof his phosphates and acids. The prisoners roomed two in a cell, but\r\nthat day there was one left over, and he was the one.\r\n\r\nThe cells were in tiers, opening upon galleries. His cell was about\r\nfive feet by seven in size, with a stone floor and a heavy wooden bench\r\nbuilt into it. There was no window\xe2\x80\x94the only light came from windows\r\nnear the roof at one end of the court outside. There were two bunks,\r\none above the other, each with a straw mattress and a pair of gray\r\nblankets\xe2\x80\x94the latter stiff as boards with filth, and alive with fleas,\r\nbedbugs, and lice. When Jurgis lifted up the mattress he discovered\r\nbeneath it a layer of scurrying roaches, almost as badly frightened as\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHere they brought him more \xe2\x80\x9cduffers and dope,\xe2\x80\x9d with the addition of a\r\nbowl of soup. Many of the prisoners had their meals brought in from a\r\nrestaurant, but Jurgis had no money for that. Some had books to read\r\nand cards to play, with candles to burn by night, but Jurgis was all\r\nalone in darkness and silence. He could not sleep again; there was the\r\nsame maddening procession of thoughts that lashed him like whips upon\r\nhis naked back. When night fell he was pacing up and down his cell like\r\na wild beast that breaks its teeth upon the bars of its cage. Now and\r\nthen in his frenzy he would fling himself against the walls of the\r\nplace, beating his hands upon them. They cut him and bruised him\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwere cold and merciless as the men who had built them.\r\n\r\nIn the distance there was a church-tower bell that tolled the hours one\r\nby one. When it came to midnight Jurgis was lying upon the floor with\r\nhis head in his arms, listening. Instead of falling silent at the end,\r\nthe bell broke into a sudden clangor. Jurgis raised his head; what\r\ncould that mean\xe2\x80\x94a fire? God! Suppose there were to be a fire in this\r\njail! But then he made out a melody in the ringing; there were chimes.\r\nAnd they seemed to waken the city\xe2\x80\x94all around, far and near, there were\r\nbells, ringing wild music; for fully a minute Jurgis lay lost in\r\nwonder, before, all at once, the meaning of it broke over him\xe2\x80\x94that this\r\nwas Christmas Eve!\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve\xe2\x80\x94he had forgotten it entirely! There was a breaking of\r\nfloodgates, a whirl of new memories and new griefs rushing into his\r\nmind. In far Lithuania they had celebrated Christmas; and it came to\r\nhim as if it had been yesterday\xe2\x80\x94himself a little child, with his lost\r\nbrother and his dead father in the cabin\xe2\x80\x94in the deep black forest,\r\nwhere the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the\r\nworld. It was too far off for Santa Claus in Lithuania, but it was not\r\ntoo far for peace and good will to men, for the wonder-bearing vision\r\nof the Christ Child. And even in Packingtown they had not forgotten\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94some gleam of it had never failed to break their darkness. Last\r\nChristmas Eve and all Christmas Day Jurgis had toiled on the killing\r\nbeds, and Ona at wrapping hams, and still they had found strength\r\nenough to take the children for a walk upon the avenue, to see the\r\nstore windows all decorated with Christmas trees and ablaze with\r\nelectric lights. In one window there would be live geese, in another\r\nmarvels in sugar\xe2\x80\x94pink and white canes big enough for ogres, and cakes\r\nwith cherubs upon them; in a third there would be rows of fat yellow\r\nturkeys, decorated with rosettes, and rabbits and squirrels hanging; in\r\na fourth would be a fairyland of toys\xe2\x80\x94lovely dolls with pink dresses,\r\nand woolly sheep and drums and soldier hats. Nor did they have to go\r\nwithout their share of all this, either. The last time they had had a\r\nbig basket with them and all their Christmas marketing to do\xe2\x80\x94a roast of\r\npork and a cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona,\r\nand a rubber doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of\r\ncandy to be hung from the gas jet and gazed at by half a dozen pairs of\r\nlonging eyes.\r\n\r\nEven half a year of the sausage machines and the fertilizer mill had\r\nnot been able to kill the thought of Christmas in them; there was a\r\nchoking in Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 throat as he recalled that the very night Ona had\r\nnot come home Teta Elzbieta had taken him aside and shown him an old\r\nvalentine that she had picked up in a paper store for three cents\xe2\x80\x94dingy\r\nand shopworn, but with bright colors, and figures of angels and doves.\r\nShe had wiped all the specks off this, and was going to set it on the\r\nmantel, where the children could see it. Great sobs shook Jurgis at\r\nthis memory\xe2\x80\x94they would spend their Christmas in misery and despair,\r\nwith him in prison and Ona ill and their home in desolation. Ah, it was\r\ntoo cruel! Why at least had they not left him alone\xe2\x80\x94why, after they had\r\nshut him in jail, must they be ringing Christmas chimes in his ears!\r\n\r\nBut no, their bells were not ringing for him\xe2\x80\x94their Christmas was not\r\nmeant for him, they were simply not counting him at all. He was of no\r\nconsequence\xe2\x80\x94he was flung aside, like a bit of trash, the carcass of\r\nsome animal. It was horrible, horrible! His wife might be dying, his\r\nbaby might be starving, his whole family might be perishing in the\r\ncold\xe2\x80\x94and all the while they were ringing their Christmas chimes! And\r\nthe bitter mockery of it\xe2\x80\x94all this was punishment for him! They put him\r\nin a place where the snow could not beat in, where the cold could not\r\neat through his bones; they brought him food and drink\xe2\x80\x94why, in the name\r\nof heaven, if they must punish him, did they not put his family in jail\r\nand leave him outside\xe2\x80\x94why could they find no better way to punish him\r\nthan to leave three weak women and six helpless children to starve and\r\nfreeze? That was their law, that was their justice!\r\n\r\nJurgis stood upright; trembling with passion, his hands clenched and\r\nhis arms upraised, his whole soul ablaze with hatred and defiance. Ten\r\nthousand curses upon them and their law! Their justice\xe2\x80\x94it was a lie, it\r\nwas a lie, a hideous, brutal lie, a thing too black and hateful for any\r\nworld but a world of nightmares. It was a sham and a loathsome mockery.\r\nThere was no justice, there was no right, anywhere in it\xe2\x80\x94it was only\r\nforce, it was tyranny, the will and the power, reckless and\r\nunrestrained! They had ground him beneath their heel, they had devoured\r\nall his substance; they had murdered his old father, they had broken\r\nand wrecked his wife, they had crushed and cowed his whole family; and\r\nnow they were through with him, they had no further use for him\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nbecause he had interfered with them, had gotten in their way, this was\r\nwhat they had done to him! They had put him behind bars, as if he had\r\nbeen a wild beast, a thing without sense or reason, without rights,\r\nwithout affections, without feelings. Nay, they would not even have\r\ntreated a beast as they had treated him! Would any man in his senses\r\nhave trapped a wild thing in its lair, and left its young behind to\r\ndie?\r\n\r\nThese midnight hours were fateful ones to Jurgis; in them was the\r\nbeginning of his rebellion, of his outlawry and his unbelief. He had no\r\nwit to trace back the social crime to its far sources\xe2\x80\x94he could not say\r\nthat it was the thing men have called \xe2\x80\x9cthe system\xe2\x80\x9d that was crushing\r\nhim to the earth; that it was the packers, his masters, who had bought\r\nup the law of the land, and had dealt out their brutal will to him from\r\nthe seat of justice. He only knew that he was wronged, and that the\r\nworld had wronged him; that the law, that society, with all its powers,\r\nhad declared itself his foe. And every hour his soul grew blacker,\r\nevery hour he dreamed new dreams of vengeance, of defiance, of raging,\r\nfrenzied hate.\r\n\r\nThe vilest deeds, like poison weeds,\r\n    Bloom well in prison air;\r\nIt is only what is good in Man\r\n    That wastes and withers there;\r\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\r\n    And the Warder is Despair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo wrote a poet, to whom the world had dealt its justice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI know not whether Laws be right,\r\n    Or whether Laws be wrong;\r\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\r\n    Is that the wall is strong.\r\nAnd they do well to hide their hell,\r\n    For in it things are done\r\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\r\n    Ever should look upon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning Jurgis was let out to get water to\r\nwash his cell\xe2\x80\x94a duty which he performed faithfully, but which most of\r\nthe prisoners were accustomed to shirk, until their cells became so\r\nfilthy that the guards interposed. Then he had more \xe2\x80\x9cduffers and dope,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand afterward was allowed three hours for exercise, in a long,\r\ncement-walked court roofed with glass. Here were all the inmates of the\r\njail crowded together. At one side of the court was a place for\r\nvisitors, cut off by two heavy wire screens, a foot apart, so that\r\nnothing could be passed in to the prisoners; here Jurgis watched\r\nanxiously, but there came no one to see him.\r\n\r\nSoon after he went back to his cell, a keeper opened the door to let in\r\nanother prisoner. He was a dapper young fellow, with a light brown\r\nmustache and blue eyes, and a graceful figure. He nodded to Jurgis, and\r\nthen, as the keeper closed the door upon him, began gazing critically\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as his glance encountered Jurgis again, \xe2\x80\x9cgood\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rum go for Christmas, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d added the other.\r\n\r\nJurgis nodded.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer went to the bunks and inspected the blankets; he lifted up\r\nthe mattress, and then dropped it with an exclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the worst yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Jurgis again. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks as if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been slept in last\r\nnight. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sleep last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other had another look around, and then wrinkled up his nose.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the devil of a stink in here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t they make you wash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but this don\xe2\x80\x99t wash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFertilizer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFertilizer! The deuce! What are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI work in the stockyards\xe2\x80\x94at least I did until the other day. It\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nmy clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a new one on me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the newcomer. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d been up\r\nagainst \xe2\x80\x98em all. What are you in for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hit my boss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it. What did he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x94he treated me mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. You\xe2\x80\x99re what\xe2\x80\x99s called an honest workingman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d The other laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say I\xe2\x80\x99m a cracksman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafes, and such things,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, wonderingly, and stared at the speaker in awe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmean you break into them\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not look to be over twenty-two or three, though, as Jurgis found\r\nafterward, he was thirty. He spoke like a man of education, like what\r\nthe world calls a \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you\xe2\x80\x99re here for?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here for disorderly conduct. They were mad\r\nbecause they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any evidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d the young fellow continued after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s Duane\xe2\x80\x94Jack Duane. I\xe2\x80\x99ve more than a dozen, but that\xe2\x80\x99s my company\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d He seated himself on the floor with his back to the wall and his\r\nlegs crossed, and went on talking easily; he soon put Jurgis on a\r\nfriendly footing\xe2\x80\x94he was evidently a man of the world, used to getting\r\non, and not too proud to hold conversation with a mere laboring man. He\r\ndrew Jurgis out, and heard all about his life all but the one\r\nunmentionable thing; and then he told stories about his own life. He\r\nwas a great one for stories, not always of the choicest. Being sent to\r\njail had apparently not disturbed his cheerfulness; he had \xe2\x80\x9cdone time\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntwice before, it seemed, and he took it all with a frolic welcome. What\r\nwith women and wine and the excitement of his vocation, a man could\r\nafford to rest now and then.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the aspect of prison life was changed for Jurgis by the\r\narrival of a cell mate. He could not turn his face to the wall and\r\nsulk, he had to speak when he was spoken to; nor could he help being\r\ninterested in the conversation of Duane\xe2\x80\x94the first educated man with\r\nwhom he had ever talked. How could he help listening with wonder while\r\nthe other told of midnight ventures and perilous escapes, of feastings\r\nand orgies, of fortunes squandered in a night? The young fellow had an\r\namused contempt for Jurgis, as a sort of working mule; he, too, had\r\nfelt the world\xe2\x80\x99s injustice, but instead of bearing it patiently, he had\r\nstruck back, and struck hard. He was striking all the time\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nwar between him and society. He was a genial freebooter, living off the\r\nenemy, without fear or shame. He was not always victorious, but then\r\ndefeat did not mean annihilation, and need not break his spirit.\r\n\r\nWithal he was a goodhearted fellow\xe2\x80\x94too much so, it appeared. His story\r\ncame out, not in the first day, nor the second, but in the long hours\r\nthat dragged by, in which they had nothing to do but talk and nothing\r\nto talk of but themselves. Jack Duane was from the East; he was a\r\ncollege-bred man\xe2\x80\x94had been studying electrical engineering. Then his\r\nfather had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and\r\nthere had been his mother and a younger brother and sister. Also, there\r\nwas an invention of Duane\xe2\x80\x99s; Jurgis could not understand it clearly,\r\nbut it had to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94there were fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars. And\r\nDuane had been robbed of it by a great company, and got tangled up in\r\nlawsuits and lost all his money. Then somebody had given him a tip on a\r\nhorse race, and he had tried to retrieve his fortune with another\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s money, and had to run away, and all the rest had come from\r\nthat. The other asked him what had led him to safe-breaking\xe2\x80\x94to Jurgis a\r\nwild and appalling occupation to think about. A man he had met, his\r\ncell mate had replied\xe2\x80\x94one thing leads to another. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he ever wonder\r\nabout his family, Jurgis asked. Sometimes, the other answered, but not\r\noften\xe2\x80\x94he didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it. Thinking about it would make it no better.\r\nThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a world in which a man had any business with a family;\r\nsooner or later Jurgis would find that out also, and give up the fight\r\nand shift for himself.\r\n\r\nJurgis was so transparently what he pretended to be that his cell mate\r\nwas as open with him as a child; it was pleasant to tell him\r\nadventures, he was so full of wonder and admiration, he was so new to\r\nthe ways of the country. Duane did not even bother to keep back names\r\nand places\xe2\x80\x94he told all his triumphs and his failures, his loves and his\r\ngriefs. Also he introduced Jurgis to many of the other prisoners,\r\nnearly half of whom he knew by name. The crowd had already given Jurgis\r\na name\xe2\x80\x94they called him \xe2\x80\x9cthe stinker.\xe2\x80\x9d This was cruel, but they meant no\r\nharm by it, and he took it with a good-natured grin.\r\n\r\nOur friend had caught now and then a whiff from the sewers over which\r\nhe lived, but this was the first time that he had ever been splashed by\r\ntheir filth. This jail was a Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark of the city\xe2\x80\x99s crime\xe2\x80\x94there were\r\nmurderers, \xe2\x80\x9chold-up men\xe2\x80\x9d and burglars, embezzlers, counterfeiters and\r\nforgers, bigamists, \xe2\x80\x9cshoplifters,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconfidence men,\xe2\x80\x9d petty thieves and\r\npickpockets, gamblers and procurers, brawlers, beggars, tramps and\r\ndrunkards; they were black and white, old and young, Americans and\r\nnatives of every nation under the sun. There were hardened criminals\r\nand innocent men too poor to give bail; old men, and boys literally not\r\nyet in their teens. They were the drainage of the great festering ulcer\r\nof society; they were hideous to look upon, sickening to talk to. All\r\nlife had turned to rottenness and stench in them\xe2\x80\x94love was a\r\nbeastliness, joy was a snare, and God was an imprecation. They strolled\r\nhere and there about the courtyard, and Jurgis listened to them. He was\r\nignorant and they were wise; they had been everywhere and tried\r\neverything. They could tell the whole hateful story of it, set forth\r\nthe inner soul of a city in which justice and honor, women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies and\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s souls, were for sale in the marketplace, and human beings writhed\r\nand fought and fell upon each other like wolves in a pit; in which\r\nlusts were raging fires, and men were fuel, and humanity was festering\r\nand stewing and wallowing in its own corruption. Into this wild-beast\r\ntangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken\r\npart in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was\r\nno disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were\r\nloaded. They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they\r\nhad been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\nTo most of this Jurgis tried not to listen. They frightened him with\r\ntheir savage mockery; and all the while his heart was far away, where\r\nhis loved ones were calling. Now and then in the midst of it his\r\nthoughts would take flight; and then the tears would come into his\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94and he would be called back by the jeering laughter of his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nHe spent a week in this company, and during all that time he had no\r\nword from his home. He paid one of his fifteen cents for a postal card,\r\nand his companion wrote a note to the family, telling them where he was\r\nand when he would be tried. There came no answer to it, however, and at\r\nlast, the day before New Year\xe2\x80\x99s, Jurgis bade good-by to Jack Duane. The\r\nlatter gave him his address, or rather the address of his mistress, and\r\nmade Jurgis promise to look him up. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I could help you out of a\r\nhole some day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and added that he was sorry to have him go.\r\nJurgis rode in the patrol wagon back to Justice Callahan\xe2\x80\x99s court for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things he made out as he entered the room was Teta\r\nElzbieta and little Kotrina, looking pale and frightened, seated far in\r\nthe rear. His heart began to pound, but he did not dare to try to\r\nsignal to them, and neither did Elzbieta. He took his seat in the\r\nprisoners\xe2\x80\x99 pen and sat gazing at them in helpless agony. He saw that\r\nOna was not with them, and was full of foreboding as to what that might\r\nmean. He spent half an hour brooding over this\xe2\x80\x94and then suddenly he\r\nstraightened up and the blood rushed into his face. A man had come\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94Jurgis could not see his features for the bandages that swathed him,\r\nbut he knew the burly figure. It was Connor! A trembling seized him,\r\nand his limbs bent as if for a spring. Then suddenly he felt a hand on\r\nhis collar, and heard a voice behind him: \xe2\x80\x9cSit down, you son of a\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe subsided, but he never took his eyes off his enemy. The fellow was\r\nstill alive, which was a disappointment, in one way; and yet it was\r\npleasant to see him, all in penitential plasters. He and the company\r\nlawyer, who was with him, came and took seats within the judge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrailing; and a minute later the clerk called Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 name, and the\r\npoliceman jerked him to his feet and led him before the bar, gripping\r\nhim tightly by the arm, lest he should spring upon the boss.\r\n\r\nJurgis listened while the man entered the witness chair, took the oath,\r\nand told his story. The wife of the prisoner had been employed in a\r\ndepartment near him, and had been discharged for impudence to him. Half\r\nan hour later he had been violently attacked, knocked down, and almost\r\nchoked to death. He had brought witnesses\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will probably not be necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the judge and he turned\r\nto Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou admit attacking the plaintiff?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Jurgis, pointing at the boss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the judge. \xe2\x80\x9cI hit him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay \xe2\x80\x98your Honor,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, pinching his arm hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, obediently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tried to choke him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, your Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver been arrested before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, your Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to say for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated. What had he to say? In two years and a half he had\r\nlearned to speak English for practical purposes, but these had never\r\nincluded the statement that some one had intimidated and seduced his\r\nwife. He tried once or twice, stammering and balking, to the annoyance\r\nof the judge, who was gasping from the odor of fertilizer. Finally, the\r\nprisoner made it understood that his vocabulary was inadequate, and\r\nthere stepped up a dapper young man with waxed mustaches, bidding him\r\nspeak in any language he knew.\r\n\r\nJurgis began; supposing that he would be given time, he explained how\r\nthe boss had taken advantage of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s position to make advances to\r\nher and had threatened her with the loss of her place. When the\r\ninterpreter had translated this, the judge, whose calendar was crowded,\r\nand whose automobile was ordered for a certain hour, interrupted with\r\nthe remark: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see. Well, if he made love to your wife, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe complain to the superintendent or leave the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated, somewhat taken aback; he began to explain that they\r\nwere very poor\xe2\x80\x94that work was hard to get\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Justice Callahan; \xe2\x80\x9cso instead you thought you would knock\r\nhim down.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to the plaintiff, inquiring, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any truth\r\nin this story, Mr. Connor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a particle, your Honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boss. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very\r\nunpleasant\xe2\x80\x94they tell some such tale every time you have to discharge a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the judge. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear it often enough. The fellow\r\nseems to have handled you pretty roughly. Thirty days and costs. Next\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis had been listening in perplexity. It was only when the policeman\r\nwho had him by the arm turned and started to lead him away that he\r\nrealized that sentence had been passed. He gazed round him wildly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty days!\xe2\x80\x9d he panted and then he whirled upon the judge. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will\r\nmy family do?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried frantically. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a wife and baby, sir, and\r\nthey have no money\xe2\x80\x94my God, they will starve to death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have done well to think about them before you committed the\r\nassault,\xe2\x80\x9d said the judge dryly, as he turned to look at the next\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nJurgis would have spoken again, but the policeman had seized him by the\r\ncollar and was twisting it, and a second policeman was making for him\r\nwith evidently hostile intentions. So he let them lead him away. Far\r\ndown the room he saw Elzbieta and Kotrina, risen from their seats,\r\nstaring in fright; he made one effort to go to them, and then, brought\r\nback by another twist at his throat, he bowed his head and gave up the\r\nstruggle. They thrust him into a cell room, where other prisoners were\r\nwaiting; and as soon as court had adjourned they led him down with them\r\ninto the \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d and drove him away.\r\n\r\nThis time Jurgis was bound for the \xe2\x80\x9cBridewell,\xe2\x80\x9d a petty jail where Cook\r\nCounty prisoners serve their time. It was even filthier and more\r\ncrowded than the county jail; all the smaller fry out of the latter had\r\nbeen sifted into it\xe2\x80\x94the petty thieves and swindlers, the brawlers and\r\nvagrants. For his cell mate Jurgis had an Italian fruit seller who had\r\nrefused to pay his graft to the policeman, and been arrested for\r\ncarrying a large pocketknife; as he did not understand a word of\r\nEnglish our friend was glad when he left. He gave place to a Norwegian\r\nsailor, who had lost half an ear in a drunken brawl, and who proved to\r\nbe quarrelsome, cursing Jurgis because he moved in his bunk and caused\r\nthe roaches to drop upon the lower one. It would have been quite\r\nintolerable, staying in a cell with this wild beast, but for the fact\r\nthat all day long the prisoners were put at work breaking stone.\r\n\r\nTen days of his thirty Jurgis spent thus, without hearing a word from\r\nhis family; then one day a keeper came and informed him that there was\r\na visitor to see him. Jurgis turned white, and so weak at the knees\r\nthat he could hardly leave his cell.\r\n\r\nThe man led him down the corridor and a flight of steps to the\r\nvisitors\xe2\x80\x99 room, which was barred like a cell. Through the grating\r\nJurgis could see some one sitting in a chair; and as he came into the\r\nroom the person started up, and he saw that it was little Stanislovas.\r\nAt the sight of some one from home the big fellow nearly went to\r\npieces\xe2\x80\x94he had to steady himself by a chair, and he put his other hand\r\nto his forehead, as if to clear away a mist. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, weakly.\r\n\r\nLittle Stanislovas was also trembling, and all but too frightened to\r\nspeak. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x94they sent me to tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a gulp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis repeated. He followed the boy\xe2\x80\x99s glance to where the\r\nkeeper was standing watching them. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis cried,\r\nwildly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOna is very sick,\xe2\x80\x9d Stanislovas said; \xe2\x80\x9cand we are almost starving. We\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get along; we thought you might be able to help us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis gripped the chair tighter; there were beads of perspiration on\r\nhis forehead, and his hand shook. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t help you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOna lies in her room all day,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy went on, breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything, and she cries all the time. She won\xe2\x80\x99t tell what is\r\nthe matter and she won\xe2\x80\x99t go to work at all. Then a long time ago the\r\nman came for the rent. He was very cross. He came again last week. He\r\nsaid he would turn us out of the house. And then Marija\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sob choked Stanislovas, and he stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with\r\nMarija?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cut her hand!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s cut it bad, this time, worse\r\nthan before. She can\xe2\x80\x99t work and it\xe2\x80\x99s all turning green, and the company\r\ndoctor says she may\xe2\x80\x94she may have to have it cut off. And Marija cries\r\nall the time\xe2\x80\x94her money is nearly all gone, too, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the\r\nrent and the interest on the house; and we have no coal and nothing\r\nmore to eat, and the man at the store, he says\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little fellow stopped again, beginning to whimper. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nother panted in frenzy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I will,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Stanislovas. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so\xe2\x80\x94so cold all the time. And last\r\nSunday it snowed again\xe2\x80\x94a deep, deep snow\xe2\x80\x94and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod!\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis half shouted, and he took a step toward the child. There\r\nwas an old hatred between them because of the snow\xe2\x80\x94ever since that\r\ndreadful morning when the boy had had his fingers frozen and Jurgis had\r\nhad to beat him to send him to work. Now he clenched his hands, looking\r\nas if he would try to break through the grating. \xe2\x80\x9cYou little villain,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t try!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did\xe2\x80\x94I did!\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Stanislovas, shrinking from him in terror. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntried all day\xe2\x80\x94two days. Elzbieta was with me, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t either.\r\nWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk at all, it was so deep. And we had nothing to eat, and\r\noh, it was so cold! I tried, and then the third day Ona went with me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOna!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She tried to get to work, too. She had to. We were all starving.\r\nBut she had lost her place\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis reeled, and gave a gasp. \xe2\x80\x9cShe went back to that place?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nscreamed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe tried to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stanislovas, gazing at him in\r\nperplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, Jurgis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man breathed hard, three or four times. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\xe2\x80\x94on,\xe2\x80\x9d he panted,\r\nfinally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went with her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stanislovas, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Miss Henderson wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nher back. And Connor saw her and cursed her. He was still bandaged\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94why did you hit him, Jurgis?\xe2\x80\x9d (There was some fascinating mystery\r\nabout this, the little fellow knew; but he could get no satisfaction.)\r\n\r\nJurgis could not speak; he could only stare, his eyes starting out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been trying to get other work,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy went on; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nweak she can\xe2\x80\x99t keep up. And my boss would not take me back, either\xe2\x80\x94Ona\r\nsays he knows Connor, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason; they\xe2\x80\x99ve all got a grudge\r\nagainst us now. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go downtown and sell papers with the\r\nrest of the boys and Kotrina\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKotrina!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s been selling papers, too. She does best, because she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngirl. Only the cold is so bad\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible coming home at night,\r\nJurgis. Sometimes they can\xe2\x80\x99t come home at all\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to find\r\nthem tonight and sleep where they do, it\xe2\x80\x99s so late and it\xe2\x80\x99s such a long\r\nways home. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to walk, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where it was\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to get back, either. Only mother said I must come, because you\r\nwould want to know, and maybe somebody would help your family when they\r\nhad put you in jail so you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work. And I walked all day to get\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94and I only had a piece of bread for breakfast, Jurgis. Mother\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t any work either, because the sausage department is shut down;\r\nand she goes and begs at houses with a basket, and people give her\r\nfood. Only she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get much yesterday; it was too cold for her\r\nfingers, and today she was crying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo little Stanislovas went on, sobbing as he talked; and Jurgis stood,\r\ngripping the table tightly, saying not a word, but feeling that his\r\nhead would burst; it was like having weights piled upon him, one after\r\nanother, crushing the life out of him. He struggled and fought within\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94as if in some terrible nightmare, in which a man suffers an\r\nagony, and cannot lift his hand, nor cry out, but feels that he is\r\ngoing mad, that his brain is on fire\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nJust when it seemed to him that another turn of the screw would kill\r\nhim, little Stanislovas stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot help us?\xe2\x80\x9d he said weakly.\r\n\r\nJurgis shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t give you anything here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you coming out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree weeks yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis answered.\r\n\r\nAnd the boy gazed around him uncertainly. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I might as well go,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nJurgis nodded. Then, suddenly recollecting, he put his hand into his\r\npocket and drew it out, shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding out the\r\nfourteen cents. \xe2\x80\x9cTake this to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Stanislovas took it, and after a little more hesitation, started\r\nfor the door. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Jurgis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and the other noticed that he\r\nwalked unsteadily as he passed out of sight.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or so Jurgis stood clinging to his chair, reeling and\r\nswaying; then the keeper touched him on the arm, and he turned and went\r\nback to breaking stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis did not get out of the Bridewell quite as soon as he had\r\nexpected. To his sentence there were added \xe2\x80\x9ccourt costs\xe2\x80\x9d of a dollar\r\nand a half\xe2\x80\x94he was supposed to pay for the trouble of putting him in\r\njail, and not having the money, was obliged to work it off by three\r\ndays more of toil. Nobody had taken the trouble to tell him this\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nafter counting the days and looking forward to the end in an agony of\r\nimpatience, when the hour came that he expected to be free he found\r\nhimself still set at the stone heap, and laughed at when he ventured to\r\nprotest. Then he concluded he must have counted wrong; but as another\r\nday passed, he gave up all hope\xe2\x80\x94and was sunk in the depths of despair,\r\nwhen one morning after breakfast a keeper came to him with the word\r\nthat his time was up at last. So he doffed his prison garb, and put on\r\nhis old fertilizer clothing, and heard the door of the prison clang\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHe stood upon the steps, bewildered; he could hardly believe that it\r\nwas true,\xe2\x80\x94that the sky was above him again and the open street before\r\nhim; that he was a free man. But then the cold began to strike through\r\nhis clothes, and he started quickly away.\r\n\r\nThere had been a heavy snow, and now a thaw had set in; fine sleety\r\nrain was falling, driven by a wind that pierced Jurgis to the bone. He\r\nhad not stopped for his-overcoat when he set out to \xe2\x80\x9cdo up\xe2\x80\x9d Connor, and\r\nso his rides in the patrol wagons had been cruel experiences; his\r\nclothing was old and worn thin, and it never had been very warm. Now as\r\nhe trudged on the rain soon wet it through; there were six inches of\r\nwatery slush on the sidewalks, so that his feet would soon have been\r\nsoaked, even had there been no holes in his shoes.\r\n\r\nJurgis had had enough to eat in the jail, and the work had been the\r\nleast trying of any that he had done since he came to Chicago; but even\r\nso, he had not grown strong\xe2\x80\x94the fear and grief that had preyed upon his\r\nmind had worn him thin. Now he shivered and shrunk from the rain,\r\nhiding his hands in his pockets and hunching his shoulders together.\r\nThe Bridewell grounds were on the outskirts of the city and the country\r\naround them was unsettled and wild\xe2\x80\x94on one side was the big drainage\r\ncanal, and on the other a maze of railroad tracks, and so the wind had\r\nfull sweep.\r\n\r\nAfter walking a ways, Jurgis met a little ragamuffin whom he hailed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, sonny!\xe2\x80\x9d The boy cocked one eye at him\xe2\x80\x94he knew that Jurgis was a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cjailbird\xe2\x80\x9d by his shaven head. \xe2\x80\x9cWot yer want?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you go to the stockyards?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the boy.\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated a moment, nonplussed. Then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean which is\r\nthe way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t yer say so then?\xe2\x80\x9d was the response, and the boy pointed to\r\nthe northwest, across the tracks. \xe2\x80\x9cThat way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cMebbe twenty\r\nmiles or so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty miles!\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis echoed, and his face fell. He had to walk every\r\nfoot of it, for they had turned him out of jail without a penny in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nYet, when he once got started, and his blood had warmed with walking,\r\nhe forgot everything in the fever of his thoughts. All the dreadful\r\nimaginations that had haunted him in his cell now rushed into his mind\r\nat once. The agony was almost over\xe2\x80\x94he was going to find out; and he\r\nclenched his hands in his pockets as he strode, following his flying\r\ndesire, almost at a run. Ona\xe2\x80\x94the baby\xe2\x80\x94the family\xe2\x80\x94the house\xe2\x80\x94he would\r\nknow the truth about them all! And he was coming to the rescue\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nfree again! His hands were his own, and he could help them, he could do\r\nbattle for them against the world.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or so he walked thus, and then he began to look about him.\r\nHe seemed to be leaving the city altogether. The street was turning\r\ninto a country road, leading out to the westward; there were\r\nsnow-covered fields on either side of him. Soon he met a farmer driving\r\na two-horse wagon loaded with straw, and he stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the way to the stockyards?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe farmer scratched his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno jest where they be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re in the city somewhere, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going dead away from it\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis looked dazed. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told this was the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mebbe he was playing a joke on ye. The best thing ye kin do is\r\nto go back, and when ye git into town ask a policeman. I\xe2\x80\x99d take ye in,\r\nonly I\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long ways an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m loaded heavy. Git up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis turned and followed, and toward the end of the morning he\r\nbegan to see Chicago again. Past endless blocks of two-story shanties\r\nhe walked, along wooden sidewalks and unpaved pathways treacherous with\r\ndeep slush holes. Every few blocks there would be a railroad crossing\r\non the level with the sidewalk, a deathtrap for the unwary; long\r\nfreight trains would be passing, the cars clanking and crashing\r\ntogether, and Jurgis would pace about waiting, burning up with a fever\r\nof impatience. Occasionally the cars would stop for some minutes, and\r\nwagons and streetcars would crowd together waiting, the drivers\r\nswearing at each other, or hiding beneath umbrellas out of the rain; at\r\nsuch times Jurgis would dodge under the gates and run across the tracks\r\nand between the cars, taking his life into his hands.\r\n\r\nHe crossed a long bridge over a river frozen solid and covered with\r\nslush. Not even on the river bank was the snow white\xe2\x80\x94the rain which\r\nfell was a diluted solution of smoke, and Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 hands and face were\r\nstreaked with black. Then he came into the business part of the city,\r\nwhere the streets were sewers of inky blackness, with horses sleeping\r\nand plunging, and women and children flying across in panic-stricken\r\ndroves. These streets were huge canyons formed by towering black\r\nbuildings, echoing with the clang of car gongs and the shouts of\r\ndrivers; the people who swarmed in them were as busy as ants\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nhurrying breathlessly, never stopping to look at anything nor at each\r\nother. The solitary trampish-looking foreigner, with water-soaked\r\nclothing and haggard face and anxious eyes, was as much alone as he\r\nhurried past them, as much unheeded and as lost, as if he had been a\r\nthousand miles deep in a wilderness.\r\n\r\nA policeman gave him his direction and told him that he had five miles\r\nto go. He came again to the slum districts, to avenues of saloons and\r\ncheap stores, with long dingy red factory buildings, and coal-yards and\r\nrailroad tracks; and then Jurgis lifted up his head and began to sniff\r\nthe air like a startled animal\xe2\x80\x94scenting the far-off odor of home. It\r\nwas late afternoon then, and he was hungry, but the dinner invitations\r\nhung out of the saloons were not for him.\r\n\r\nSo he came at last to the stockyards, to the black volcanoes of smoke\r\nand the lowing cattle and the stench. Then, seeing a crowded car, his\r\nimpatience got the better of him and he jumped aboard, hiding behind\r\nanother man, unnoticed by the conductor. In ten minutes more he had\r\nreached his street, and home.\r\n\r\nHe was half running as he came round the corner. There was the house,\r\nat any rate\xe2\x80\x94and then suddenly he stopped and stared. What was the\r\nmatter with the house?\r\n\r\nJurgis looked twice, bewildered; then he glanced at the house next door\r\nand at the one beyond\xe2\x80\x94then at the saloon on the corner. Yes, it was the\r\nright place, quite certainly\xe2\x80\x94he had not made any mistake. But the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94the house was a different color!\r\n\r\nHe came a couple of steps nearer. Yes; it had been gray and now it was\r\nyellow! The trimmings around the windows had been red, and now they\r\nwere green! It was all newly painted! How strange it made it seem!\r\n\r\nJurgis went closer yet, but keeping on the other side of the street. A\r\nsudden and horrible spasm of fear had come over him. His knees were\r\nshaking beneath him, and his mind was in a whirl. New paint on the\r\nhouse, and new weatherboards, where the old had begun to rot off, and\r\nthe agent had got after them! New shingles over the hole in the roof,\r\ntoo, the hole that had for six months been the bane of his soul\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhaving no money to have it fixed and no time to fix it himself, and the\r\nrain leaking in, and overflowing the pots and pans he put to catch it,\r\nand flooding the attic and loosening the plaster. And now it was fixed!\r\nAnd the broken windowpane replaced! And curtains in the windows! New,\r\nwhite curtains, stiff and shiny!\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the front door opened. Jurgis stood, his chest heaving as\r\nhe struggled to catch his breath. A boy had come out, a stranger to\r\nhim; a big, fat, rosy-cheeked youngster, such as had never been seen in\r\nhis home before.\r\n\r\nJurgis stared at the boy, fascinated. He came down the steps whistling,\r\nkicking off the snow. He stopped at the foot, and picked up some, and\r\nthen leaned against the railing, making a snowball. A moment later he\r\nlooked around and saw Jurgis, and their eyes met; it was a hostile\r\nglance, the boy evidently thinking that the other had suspicions of the\r\nsnowball. When Jurgis started slowly across the street toward him, he\r\ngave a quick glance about, meditating retreat, but then he concluded to\r\nstand his ground.\r\n\r\nJurgis took hold of the railing of the steps, for he was a little\r\nunsteady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d he managed to gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the boy, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou live here!\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis panted. He turned white and clung more tightly\r\nto the railing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou live here! Then where\xe2\x80\x99s my family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy looked surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cYour family!\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed.\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis started toward him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94this is my house!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome off!\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy; then suddenly the door upstairs opened, and\r\nhe called: \xe2\x80\x9cHey, ma! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow says he owns this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA stout Irishwoman came to the top of the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nJurgis turned toward her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my family?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nleft them here! This is my home! What are you doing in my home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at him in frightened wonder, she must have thought she\r\nwas dealing with a maniac\xe2\x80\x94Jurgis looked like one. \xe2\x80\x9cYour home!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nechoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy home!\xe2\x80\x9d he half shrieked. \xe2\x80\x9cI lived here, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one ever lived here. This\r\nis a new house. They told us so. They\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have they done with my family?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Jurgis, frantically.\r\n\r\nA light had begun to break upon the woman; perhaps she had had doubts\r\nof what \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d had told her. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where your family is,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought the house only three days ago, and there was nobody\r\nhere, and they told me it was all new. Do you really mean you had ever\r\nrented it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRented it!\xe2\x80\x9d panted Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought it! I paid for it! I own it! And\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x94my God, can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me where my people went?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made him understand at last that she knew nothing. Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 brain\r\nwas so confused that he could not grasp the situation. It was as if his\r\nfamily had been wiped out of existence; as if they were proving to be\r\ndream people, who never had existed at all. He was quite lost\xe2\x80\x94but then\r\nsuddenly he thought of Grandmother Majauszkiene, who lived in the next\r\nblock. She would know! He turned and started at a run.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Majauszkiene came to the door herself. She cried out when\r\nshe saw Jurgis, wild-eyed and shaking. Yes, yes, she could tell him.\r\nThe family had moved; they had not been able to pay the rent and they\r\nhad been turned out into the snow, and the house had been repainted and\r\nsold again the next week. No, she had not heard how they were, but she\r\ncould tell him that they had gone back to Aniele Jukniene, with whom\r\nthey had stayed when they first came to the yards. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Jurgis come\r\nin and rest? It was certainly too bad\xe2\x80\x94if only he had not got into jail\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis turned and staggered away. He did not go very far round\r\nthe corner he gave out completely, and sat down on the steps of a\r\nsaloon, and hid his face in his hands, and shook all over with dry,\r\nracking sobs.\r\n\r\nTheir home! Their home! They had lost it! Grief, despair, rage,\r\noverwhelmed him\xe2\x80\x94what was any imagination of the thing to this\r\nheartbreaking, crushing reality of it\xe2\x80\x94to the sight of strange people\r\nliving in his house, hanging their curtains to his windows, staring at\r\nhim with hostile eyes! It was monstrous, it was unthinkable\xe2\x80\x94they could\r\nnot do it\xe2\x80\x94it could not be true! Only think what he had suffered for\r\nthat house\xe2\x80\x94what miseries they had all suffered for it\xe2\x80\x94the price they\r\nhad paid for it!\r\n\r\nThe whole long agony came back to him. Their sacrifices in the\r\nbeginning, their three hundred dollars that they had scraped together,\r\nall they owned in the world, all that stood between them and\r\nstarvation! And then their toil, month by month, to get together the\r\ntwelve dollars, and the interest as well, and now and then the taxes,\r\nand the other charges, and the repairs, and what not! Why, they had put\r\ntheir very souls into their payments on that house, they had paid for\r\nit with their sweat and tears\xe2\x80\x94yes, more, with their very lifeblood.\r\nDede Antanas had died of the struggle to earn that money\xe2\x80\x94he would have\r\nbeen alive and strong today if he had not had to work in Durham\xe2\x80\x99s dark\r\ncellars to earn his share. And Ona, too, had given her health and\r\nstrength to pay for it\xe2\x80\x94she was wrecked and ruined because of it; and so\r\nwas he, who had been a big, strong man three years ago, and now sat\r\nhere shivering, broken, cowed, weeping like a hysterical child. Ah!\r\nthey had cast their all into the fight; and they had lost, they had\r\nlost! All that they had paid was gone\xe2\x80\x94every cent of it. And their house\r\nwas gone\xe2\x80\x94they were back where they had started from, flung out into the\r\ncold to starve and freeze!\r\n\r\nJurgis could see all the truth now\xe2\x80\x94could see himself, through the whole\r\nlong course of events, the victim of ravenous vultures that had torn\r\ninto his vitals and devoured him; of fiends that had racked and\r\ntortured him, mocking him, meantime, jeering in his face. Ah, God, the\r\nhorror of it, the monstrous, hideous, demoniacal wickedness of it! He\r\nand his family, helpless women and children, struggling to live,\r\nignorant and defenseless and forlorn as they were\xe2\x80\x94and the enemies that\r\nhad been lurking for them, crouching upon their trail and thirsting for\r\ntheir blood! That first lying circular, that smooth-tongued slippery\r\nagent! That trap of the extra payments, the interest, and all the other\r\ncharges that they had not the means to pay, and would never have\r\nattempted to pay! And then all the tricks of the packers, their\r\nmasters, the tyrants who ruled them\xe2\x80\x94the shutdowns and the scarcity of\r\nwork, the irregular hours and the cruel speeding-up, the lowering of\r\nwages, the raising of prices! The mercilessness of nature about them,\r\nof heat and cold, rain and snow; the mercilessness of the city, of the\r\ncountry in which they lived, of its laws and customs that they did not\r\nunderstand! All of these things had worked together for the company\r\nthat had marked them for its prey and was waiting for its chance. And\r\nnow, with this last hideous injustice, its time had come, and it had\r\nturned them out bag and baggage, and taken their house and sold it\r\nagain! And they could do nothing, they were tied hand and foot\xe2\x80\x94the law\r\nwas against them, the whole machinery of society was at their\r\noppressors\xe2\x80\x99 command! If Jurgis so much as raised a hand against them,\r\nback he would go into that wild-beast pen from which he had just\r\nescaped!\r\n\r\nTo get up and go away was to give up, to acknowledge defeat, to leave\r\nthe strange family in possession; and Jurgis might have sat shivering\r\nin the rain for hours before he could do that, had it not been for the\r\nthought of his family. It might be that he had worse things yet to\r\nlearn\xe2\x80\x94and so he got to his feet and started away, walking on, wearily,\r\nhalf-dazed.\r\n\r\nTo Aniele\xe2\x80\x99s house, in back of the yards, was a good two miles; the\r\ndistance had never seemed longer to Jurgis, and when he saw the\r\nfamiliar dingy-gray shanty his heart was beating fast. He ran up the\r\nsteps and began to hammer upon the door.\r\n\r\nThe old woman herself came to open it. She had shrunk all up with her\r\nrheumatism since Jurgis had seen her last, and her yellow parchment\r\nface stared up at him from a little above the level of the doorknob.\r\nShe gave a start when she saw him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Ona here?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis began, and then stopped short, clutching convulsively at\r\nthe side of the door. From somewhere within the house had come a sudden\r\ncry, a wild, horrible scream of anguish. And the voice was Ona\xe2\x80\x99s. For a\r\nmoment Jurgis stood half-paralyzed with fright; then he bounded past\r\nthe old woman and into the room.\r\n\r\nIt was Aniele\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen, and huddled round the stove were half a dozen\r\nwomen, pale and frightened. One of them started to her feet as Jurgis\r\nentered; she was haggard and frightfully thin, with one arm tied up in\r\nbandages\xe2\x80\x94he hardly realized that it was Marija. He looked first for\r\nOna; then, not seeing her, he stared at the women, expecting them to\r\nspeak. But they sat dumb, gazing back at him, panic-stricken; and a\r\nsecond later came another piercing scream.\r\n\r\nIt was from the rear of the house, and upstairs. Jurgis bounded to a\r\ndoor of the room and flung it open; there was a ladder leading through\r\na trap door to the garret, and he was at the foot of it when suddenly\r\nhe heard a voice behind him, and saw Marija at his heels. She seized\r\nhim by the sleeve with her good hand, panting wildly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Jurgis!\r\nStop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go up,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nJurgis was half-crazed with bewilderment and fright. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija clung to him tightly; he could hear Ona sobbing and moaning\r\nabove, and he fought to get away and climb up, without waiting for her\r\nreply. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she rushed on. \xe2\x80\x9cJurgis! You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go up! It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child?\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed in perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cAntanas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija answered him, in a whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cThe new one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Jurgis went limp, and caught himself on the ladder. He stared\r\nat her as if she were a ghost. \xe2\x80\x9cThe new one!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, wildly.\r\n\r\nMarija nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then again came Ona\xe2\x80\x99s scream, smiting him like a blow in the face,\r\nmaking him wince and turn white. Her voice died away into a wail\xe2\x80\x94then\r\nhe heard her sobbing again, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God\xe2\x80\x94let me die, let me die!\xe2\x80\x9d And Marija\r\nhung her arms about him, crying: \xe2\x80\x9cCome out! Come away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dragged him back into the kitchen, half carrying him, for he had\r\ngone all to pieces. It was as if the pillars of his soul had fallen\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94he was blasted with horror. In the room he sank into a chair,\r\ntrembling like a leaf, Marija still holding him, and the women staring\r\nat him in dumb, helpless fright.\r\n\r\nAnd then again Ona cried out; he could hear it nearly as plainly here,\r\nand he staggered to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long has this been going on?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very long,\xe2\x80\x9d Marija answered, and then, at a signal from Aniele,\r\nshe rushed on: \xe2\x80\x9cYou go away, Jurgis you can\xe2\x80\x99t help\xe2\x80\x94go away and come\r\nback later. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s with her?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis demanded; and then, seeing Marija hesitating,\r\nhe cried again, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cElzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d he panted. \xe2\x80\x9cSome one who knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized Marija by the arm; she trembled, and her voice sank beneath a\r\nwhisper as she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x94we have no money.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, frightened at the\r\nlook on his face, she exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Jurgis! You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x94go away\xe2\x80\x94go away! Ah, if you only had waited!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbove her protests Jurgis heard Ona again; he was almost out of his\r\nmind. It was all new to him, raw and horrible\xe2\x80\x94it had fallen upon him\r\nlike a lightning stroke. When little Antanas was born he had been at\r\nwork, and had known nothing about it until it was over; and now he was\r\nnot to be controlled. The frightened women were at their wits\xe2\x80\x99 end; one\r\nafter another they tried to reason with him, to make him understand\r\nthat this was the lot of woman. In the end they half drove him out into\r\nthe rain, where he began to pace up and down, bareheaded and frantic.\r\nBecause he could hear Ona from the street, he would first go away to\r\nescape the sounds, and then come back because he could not help it. At\r\nthe end of a quarter of an hour he rushed up the steps again, and for\r\nfear that he would break in the door they had to open it and let him\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThere was no arguing with him. They could not tell him that all was\r\ngoing well\xe2\x80\x94how could they know, he cried\xe2\x80\x94why, she was dying, she was\r\nbeing torn to pieces! Listen to her\xe2\x80\x94listen! Why, it was monstrous\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ncould not be allowed\xe2\x80\x94there must be some help for it! Had they tried to\r\nget a doctor? They might pay him afterward\xe2\x80\x94they could promise\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t promise, Jurgis,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Marija. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had no money\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nhave scarcely been able to keep alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can work,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can earn money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut we thought you were in jail. How could we know\r\nwhen you would return? They will not work for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija went on to tell how she had tried to find a midwife, and how\r\nthey had demanded ten, fifteen, even twenty-five dollars, and that in\r\ncash. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had only a quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have spent every cent of\r\nmy money\xe2\x80\x94all that I had in the bank; and I owe the doctor who has been\r\ncoming to see me, and he has stopped because he thinks I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\npay him. And we owe Aniele for two weeks\xe2\x80\x99 rent, and she is nearly\r\nstarving, and is afraid of being turned out. We have been borrowing and\r\nbegging to keep alive, and there is nothing more we can do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the children?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children have not been home for three days, the weather has been\r\nso bad. They could not know what is happening\xe2\x80\x94it came suddenly, two\r\nmonths before we expected it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis was standing by the table, and he caught himself with his hand;\r\nhis head sank and his arms shook\xe2\x80\x94it looked as if he were going to\r\ncollapse. Then suddenly Aniele got up and came hobbling toward him,\r\nfumbling in her skirt pocket. She drew out a dirty rag, in one corner\r\nof which she had something tied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Jurgis!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have some money. _Palauk!_ See!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe unwrapped it and counted it out\xe2\x80\x94thirty-four cents. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go, now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cand try and get somebody yourself. And maybe the rest can\r\nhelp\xe2\x80\x94give him some money, you; he will pay you back some day, and it\r\nwill do him good to have something to think about, even if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsucceed. When he comes back, maybe it will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so the other women turned out the contents of their pocketbooks;\r\nmost of them had only pennies and nickels, but they gave him all. Mrs.\r\nOlszewski, who lived next door, and had a husband who was a skilled\r\ncattle butcher, but a drinking man, gave nearly half a dollar, enough\r\nto raise the whole sum to a dollar and a quarter. Then Jurgis thrust it\r\ninto his pocket, still holding it tightly in his fist, and started away\r\nat a run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Haupt Hebamme\xe2\x80\x9d, ran a sign, swinging from a second-story window\r\nover a saloon on the avenue; at a side door was another sign, with a\r\nhand pointing up a dingy flight of stairs. Jurgis went up them, three\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\nMadame Haupt was frying pork and onions, and had her door half open to\r\nlet out the smoke. When he tried to knock upon it, it swung open the\r\nrest of the way, and he had a glimpse of her, with a black bottle\r\nturned up to her lips. Then he knocked louder, and she started and put\r\nit away. She was a Dutchwoman, enormously fat\xe2\x80\x94when she walked she\r\nrolled like a small boat on the ocean, and the dishes in the cupboard\r\njostled each other. She wore a filthy blue wrapper, and her teeth were\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVot is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she saw Jurgis.\r\n\r\nHe had run like mad all the way and was so out of breath he could\r\nhardly speak. His hair was flying and his eyes wild\xe2\x80\x94he looked like a\r\nman that had risen from the tomb. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife!\xe2\x80\x9d he panted. \xe2\x80\x9cCome quickly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMadame Haupt set the frying pan to one side and wiped her hands on her\r\nwrapper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou vant me to come for a case?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haf yust come back from a case,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI haf had no time to eat\r\nmy dinner. Still\xe2\x80\x94if it is so bad\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVell, den, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94vot you pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94how much do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTventy-five dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d His face fell. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t pay that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe woman was watching him narrowly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you pay?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I pay now\xe2\x80\x94right away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; all my customers do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t much money,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis began in an agony of dread. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94in trouble\xe2\x80\x94and my money is gone. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you\xe2\x80\x94every cent\xe2\x80\x94just as\r\nsoon as I can; I can work\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVot is your work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no place now. I must get one. But I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much haf you got now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could hardly bring himself to reply. When he said \xe2\x80\x9cA dollar and a\r\nquarter,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman laughed in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI vould not put on my hat for a dollar and a quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded, his voice breaking. \xe2\x80\x9cI must get some\r\none\xe2\x80\x94my wife will die. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Haupt had put back her pork and onions on the stove. She turned\r\nto him and answered, out of the steam and noise: \xe2\x80\x9cGit me ten dollars\r\ncash, und so you can pay me the rest next mont\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do it\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it!\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis protested. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I have\r\nonly a dollar and a quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman turned to her work. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDot is\r\nall to try to sheat me. Vot is de reason a big man like you has got\r\nonly a dollar und a quarter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just been in jail,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis cried\xe2\x80\x94he was ready to get down upon\r\nhis knees to the woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I had no money before, and my family has\r\nalmost starved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVere is your friends, dot ought to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all poor,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey gave me this. I have done\r\neverything I can\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got notting you can sell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing, I tell you\xe2\x80\x94I have nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, frantically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you borrow it, den? Don\xe2\x80\x99t your store people trust you?\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as\r\nhe shook his head, she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me\xe2\x80\x94if you git me you vill be\r\nglad of it. I vill save your wife und baby for you, and it vill not\r\nseem like mooch to you in de end. If you loose dem now how you tink you\r\nfeel den? Und here is a lady dot knows her business\xe2\x80\x94I could send you to\r\npeople in dis block, und dey vould tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Haupt was pointing her cooking-fork at Jurgis persuasively; but\r\nher words were more than he could bear. He flung up his hands with a\r\ngesture of despair and turned and started away. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed\xe2\x80\x94but suddenly he heard the woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind him again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI vill make it five dollars for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed behind him, arguing with him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou vill be foolish not to\r\ntake such an offer,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou von\xe2\x80\x99t find nobody go out on a rainy\r\nday like dis for less. Vy, I haf never took a case in my life so sheap\r\nas dot. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay mine room rent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis interrupted her with an oath of rage. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted, \xe2\x80\x9chow can I pay it? Damn it, I would pay you if I could, but I\r\ntell you I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it! Do you hear me\xe2\x80\x94_I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot it!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and started away again. He was halfway down the stairs before\r\nMadame Haupt could shout to him: \xe2\x80\x9cVait! I vill go mit you! Come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back into the room again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not goot to tink of anybody suffering,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a\r\nmelancholy voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI might as vell go mit you for noffing as vot you\r\noffer me, but I vill try to help you. How far is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree or four blocks from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTree or four! Und so I shall get soaked! Gott in Himmel, it ought to\r\nbe vorth more! Vun dollar und a quarter, und a day like dis!\xe2\x80\x94But you\r\nunderstand now\xe2\x80\x94you vill pay me de rest of twenty-five dollars soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome time dis mont\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, within a month,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything! Hurry up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVere is de dollar und a quarter?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Madame Haupt,\r\nrelentlessly.\r\n\r\nJurgis put the money on the table and the woman counted it and stowed\r\nit away. Then she wiped her greasy hands again and proceeded to get\r\nready, complaining all the time; she was so fat that it was painful for\r\nher to move, and she grunted and gasped at every step. She took off her\r\nwrapper without even taking the trouble to turn her back to Jurgis, and\r\nput on her corsets and dress. Then there was a black bonnet which had\r\nto be adjusted carefully, and an umbrella which was mislaid, and a bag\r\nfull of necessaries which had to be collected from here and there\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nman being nearly crazy with anxiety in the meantime. When they were on\r\nthe street he kept about four paces ahead of her, turning now and then,\r\nas if he could hurry her on by the force of his desire. But Madame\r\nHaupt could only go so far at a step, and it took all her attention to\r\nget the needed breath for that.\r\n\r\nThey came at last to the house, and to the group of frightened women in\r\nthe kitchen. It was not over yet, Jurgis learned\xe2\x80\x94he heard Ona crying\r\nstill; and meantime Madame Haupt removed her bonnet and laid it on the\r\nmantelpiece, and got out of her bag, first an old dress and then a\r\nsaucer of goose grease, which she proceeded to rub upon her hands. The\r\nmore cases this goose grease is used in, the better luck it brings to\r\nthe midwife, and so she keeps it upon her kitchen mantelpiece or stowed\r\naway in a cupboard with her dirty clothes, for months, and sometimes\r\neven for years.\r\n\r\nThen they escorted her to the ladder, and Jurgis heard her give an\r\nexclamation of dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cGott in Himmel, vot for haf you brought me to a\r\nplace like dis? I could not climb up dot ladder. I could not git troo a\r\ntrap door! I vill not try it\xe2\x80\x94vy, I might kill myself already. Vot sort\r\nof a place is dot for a woman to bear a child in\xe2\x80\x94up in a garret, mit\r\nonly a ladder to it? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis\r\nstood in the doorway and listened to her scolding, half drowning out\r\nthe horrible moans and screams of Ona.\r\n\r\nAt last Aniele succeeded in pacifying her, and she essayed the ascent;\r\nthen, however, she had to be stopped while the old woman cautioned her\r\nabout the floor of the garret. They had no real floor\xe2\x80\x94they had laid old\r\nboards in one part to make a place for the family to live; it was all\r\nright and safe there, but the other part of the garret had only the\r\njoists of the floor, and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below, and\r\nif one stepped on this there would be a catastrophe. As it was half\r\ndark up above, perhaps one of the others had best go up first with a\r\ncandle. Then there were more outcries and threatening, until at last\r\nJurgis had a vision of a pair of elephantine legs disappearing through\r\nthe trap door, and felt the house shake as Madame Haupt started to\r\nwalk. Then suddenly Aniele came to him and took him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou go away. Do as I tell you\xe2\x80\x94you have done all you\r\ncan, and you are only in the way. Go away and stay away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where shall I go?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked, helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on the street, if there is no\r\nother place\xe2\x80\x94only go! And stay all night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end she and Marija pushed him out of the door and shut it behind\r\nhim. It was just about sundown, and it was turning cold\xe2\x80\x94the rain had\r\nchanged to snow, and the slush was freezing. Jurgis shivered in his\r\nthin clothing, and put his hands into his pockets and started away. He\r\nhad not eaten since morning, and he felt weak and ill; with a sudden\r\nthrob of hope he recollected he was only a few blocks from the saloon\r\nwhere he had been wont to eat his dinner. They might have mercy on him\r\nthere, or he might meet a friend. He set out for the place as fast as\r\nhe could walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said the saloon-keeper, when he entered\xe2\x80\x94they call all\r\nforeigners and unskilled men \xe2\x80\x9cJack\xe2\x80\x9d in Packingtown. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99ve you\r\nbeen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis went straight to the bar. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in jail,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve just got out. I walked home all the way, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve not a cent, and\r\nhad nothing to eat since this morning. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my home, and my\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s ill, and I\xe2\x80\x99m done up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe saloon-keeper gazed at him, with his haggard white face and his\r\nblue trembling lips. Then he pushed a big bottle toward him. \xe2\x80\x9cFill her\r\nup!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nJurgis could hardly hold the bottle, his hands shook so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the saloon-keeper, \xe2\x80\x9cfill her up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis drank a large glass of whisky, and then turned to the lunch\r\ncounter, in obedience to the other\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion. He ate all he dared,\r\nstuffing it in as fast as he could; and then, after trying to speak his\r\ngratitude, he went and sat down by the big red stove in the middle of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nIt was too good to last, however\xe2\x80\x94like all things in this hard world.\r\nHis soaked clothing began to steam, and the horrible stench of\r\nfertilizer to fill the room. In an hour or so the packing houses would\r\nbe closing and the men coming in from their work; and they would not\r\ncome into a place that smelt of Jurgis. Also it was Saturday night, and\r\nin a couple of hours would come a violin and a cornet, and in the rear\r\npart of the saloon the families of the neighborhood would dance and\r\nfeast upon wienerwurst and lager, until two or three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning. The saloon-keeper coughed once or twice, and then remarked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Jack, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to quit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was used to the sight of human wrecks, this saloon-keeper; he\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfired\xe2\x80\x9d dozens of them every night, just as haggard and cold and\r\nforlorn as this one. But they were all men who had given up and been\r\ncounted out, while Jurgis was still in the fight, and had reminders of\r\ndecency about him. As he got up meekly, the other reflected that he had\r\nalways been a steady man, and might soon be a good customer again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been up against it, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the saloon were the cellar stairs. There was a door\r\nabove and another below, both safely padlocked, making the stairs an\r\nadmirable place to stow away a customer who might still chance to have\r\nmoney, or a political light whom it was not advisable to kick out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis spent the night. The whisky had only half warmed him, and he\r\ncould not sleep, exhausted as he was; he would nod forward, and then\r\nstart up, shivering with the cold, and begin to remember again. Hour\r\nafter hour passed, until he could only persuade himself that it was not\r\nmorning by the sounds of music and laughter and singing that were to be\r\nheard from the room. When at last these ceased, he expected that he\r\nwould be turned out into the street; as this did not happen, he fell to\r\nwondering whether the man had forgotten him.\r\n\r\nIn the end, when the silence and suspense were no longer to be borne,\r\nhe got up and hammered on the door; and the proprietor came, yawning\r\nand rubbing his eyes. He was keeping open all night, and dozing between\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go home,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m worried about my wife\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwait any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the hell didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so before?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have any home to go to.\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis went outside. It was four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and as black as night. There were three or four\r\ninches of fresh snow on the ground, and the flakes were falling thick\r\nand fast. He turned toward Aniele\xe2\x80\x99s and started at a run.\r\n\r\nThere was a light burning in the kitchen window and the blinds were\r\ndrawn. The door was unlocked and Jurgis rushed in.\r\n\r\nAniele, Marija, and the rest of the women were huddled about the stove,\r\nexactly as before; with them were several newcomers, Jurgis\r\nnoticed\xe2\x80\x94also he noticed that the house was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nNo one answered him, they sat staring at him with their pale faces. He\r\ncried again: \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, by the light of the smoky lamp, he saw Marija who sat nearest\r\nhim, shaking her head slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis gave a cry of dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cNot _yet?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Marija\xe2\x80\x99s head shook. The poor fellow stood dumfounded. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear her,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been quiet a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause\xe2\x80\x94broken suddenly by a voice from the attic:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral of the women ran into the next room, while Marija sprang toward\r\nJurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cWait here!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and the two stood, pale and trembling,\r\nlistening. In a few moments it became clear that Madame Haupt was\r\nengaged in descending the ladder, scolding and exhorting again, while\r\nthe ladder creaked in protest. In a moment or two she reached the\r\nground, angry and breathless, and they heard her coming into the room.\r\nJurgis gave one glance at her, and then turned white and reeled. She\r\nhad her jacket off, like one of the workers on the killing beds. Her\r\nhands and arms were smeared with blood, and blood was splashed upon her\r\nclothing and her face.\r\n\r\nShe stood breathing hard, and gazing about her; no one made a sound. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhaf done my best,\xe2\x80\x9d she began suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can do noffing more\xe2\x80\x94dere is\r\nno use to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had ought to haf had a doctor, und\r\nnot vaited so long\xe2\x80\x94it vas too late already ven I come.\xe2\x80\x9d Once more there\r\nwas deathlike stillness. Marija was clutching Jurgis with all the power\r\nof her one well arm.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Madame Haupt turned to Aniele. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haf not got something\r\nto drink, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried. \xe2\x80\x9cSome brandy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAniele shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Gott!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame Haupt. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch people! Perhaps you vill\r\ngive me someting to eat den\xe2\x80\x94I haf had noffing since yesterday morning,\r\nund I haf vorked myself near to death here. If I could haf known it vas\r\nlike dis, I vould never haf come for such money as you gif me.\xe2\x80\x9d At this\r\nmoment she chanced to look round, and saw Jurgis: She shook her finger\r\nat him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou pays me dot money yust de\r\nsame! It is not my fault dat you send for me so late I can\xe2\x80\x99t help your\r\nvife. It is not my fault if der baby comes mit one arm first, so dot I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t save it. I haf tried all night, und in dot place vere it is not\r\nfit for dogs to be born, und mit notting to eat only vot I brings in\r\nmine own pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Madame Haupt paused for a moment to get her breath; and Marija,\r\nseeing the beads of sweat on Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, and feeling the\r\nquivering of his frame, broke out in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is Ona?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Madame Haupt. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you tink she can be ven you\r\nleave her to kill herself so? I told dem dot ven they send for de\r\npriest. She is young, und she might haf got over it, und been vell und\r\nstrong, if she had been treated right. She fight hard, dot girl\xe2\x80\x94she is\r\nnot yet quite dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis gave a frantic scream. \xe2\x80\x9c_Dead!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe vill die, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cDer baby is dead\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe garret was lighted by a candle stuck upon a board; it had almost\r\nburned itself out, and was sputtering and smoking as Jurgis rushed up\r\nthe ladder. He could make out dimly in one corner a pallet of rags and\r\nold blankets, spread upon the floor; at the foot of it was a crucifix,\r\nand near it a priest muttering a prayer. In a far corner crouched\r\nElzbieta, moaning and wailing. Upon the pallet lay Ona.\r\n\r\nShe was covered with a blanket, but he could see her shoulders and one\r\narm lying bare; she was so shrunken he would scarcely have known\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94she was all but a skeleton, and as white as a piece of chalk. Her\r\neyelids were closed, and she lay still as death. He staggered toward\r\nher and fell upon his knees with a cry of anguish: \xe2\x80\x9cOna! Ona!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not stir. He caught her hand in his, and began to clasp it\r\nfrantically, calling: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me! Answer me! It is Jurgis come\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest quivering of the eyelids, and he called again in\r\nfrenzy: \xe2\x80\x9cOna! Ona!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly her eyes opened one instant. One instant she looked at\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94there was a flash of recognition between them, he saw her afar off,\r\nas through a dim vista, standing forlorn. He stretched out his arms to\r\nher, he called her in wild despair; a fearful yearning surged up in\r\nhim, hunger for her that was agony, desire that was a new being born\r\nwithin him, tearing his heartstrings, torturing him. But it was all in\r\nvain\xe2\x80\x94she faded from him, she slipped back and was gone. And a wail of\r\nanguish burst from him, great sobs shook all his frame, and hot tears\r\nran down his cheeks and fell upon her. He clutched her hands, he shook\r\nher, he caught her in his arms and pressed her to him but she lay cold\r\nand still\xe2\x80\x94she was gone\xe2\x80\x94she was gone!\r\n\r\nThe word rang through him like the sound of a bell, echoing in the far\r\ndepths of him, making forgotten chords to vibrate, old shadowy fears to\r\nstir\xe2\x80\x94fears of the dark, fears of the void, fears of annihilation. She\r\nwas dead! She was dead! He would never see her again, never hear her\r\nagain! An icy horror of loneliness seized him; he saw himself standing\r\napart and watching all the world fade away from him\xe2\x80\x94a world of shadows,\r\nof fickle dreams. He was like a little child, in his fright and grief;\r\nhe called and called, and got no answer, and his cries of despair\r\nechoed through the house, making the women downstairs draw nearer to\r\neach other in fear. He was inconsolable, beside himself\xe2\x80\x94the priest came\r\nand laid his hand upon his shoulder and whispered to him, but he heard\r\nnot a sound. He was gone away himself, stumbling through the shadows,\r\nand groping after the soul that had fled.\r\n\r\nSo he lay. The gray dawn came up and crept into the attic. The priest\r\nleft, the women left, and he was alone with the still, white\r\nfigure\xe2\x80\x94quieter now, but moaning and shuddering, wrestling with the\r\ngrisly fiend. Now and then he would raise himself and stare at the\r\nwhite mask before him, then hide his eyes because he could not bear it.\r\nDead! _dead!_ And she was only a girl, she was barely eighteen! Her\r\nlife had hardly begun\xe2\x80\x94and here she lay murdered\xe2\x80\x94mangled, tortured to\r\ndeath!\r\n\r\nIt was morning when he rose up and came down into the kitchen\xe2\x80\x94haggard\r\nand ashen gray, reeling and dazed. More of the neighbors had come in,\r\nand they stared at him in silence as he sank down upon a chair by the\r\ntable and buried his face in his arms.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the front door opened; a blast of cold and snow\r\nrushed in, and behind it little Kotrina, breathless from running, and\r\nblue with the cold. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m home again!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI could hardly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, seeing Jurgis, she stopped with an exclamation. Looking from\r\none to another she saw that something had happened, and she asked, in a\r\nlower voice: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore anyone could reply, Jurgis started up; he went toward her,\r\nwalking unsteadily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelling papers with the boys,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe snow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any money?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly three dollars, Jurgis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKotrina, frightened by his manner, glanced at the others. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it to\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded again, and she put her hand into her pocket and\r\npulled out a lump of coins tied in a bit of rag. Jurgis took it without\r\na word, and went out of the door and down the street.\r\n\r\nThree doors away was a saloon. \xe2\x80\x9cWhisky,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he entered, and as\r\nthe man pushed him some, he tore at the rag with his teeth and pulled\r\nout half a dollar. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much is the bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get\r\ndrunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a big man cannot stay drunk very long on three dollars. That was\r\nSunday morning, and Monday night Jurgis came home, sober and sick,\r\nrealizing that he had spent every cent the family owned, and had not\r\nbought a single instant\xe2\x80\x99s forgetfulness with it.\r\n\r\nOna was not yet buried; but the police had been notified, and on the\r\nmorrow they would put the body in a pine coffin and take it to the\r\npotter\xe2\x80\x99s field. Elzbieta was out begging now, a few pennies from each\r\nof the neighbors, to get enough to pay for a mass for her; and the\r\nchildren were upstairs starving to death, while he, good-for-nothing\r\nrascal, had been spending their money on drink. So spoke Aniele,\r\nscornfully, and when he started toward the fire she added the\r\ninformation that her kitchen was no longer for him to fill with his\r\nphosphate stinks. She had crowded all her boarders into one room on\r\nOna\xe2\x80\x99s account, but now he could go up in the garret where he\r\nbelonged\xe2\x80\x94and not there much longer, either, if he did not pay her some\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nJurgis went without a word, and, stepping over half a dozen sleeping\r\nboarders in the next room, ascended the ladder. It was dark up above;\r\nthey could not afford any light; also it was nearly as cold as\r\noutdoors. In a corner, as far away from the corpse as possible, sat\r\nMarija, holding little Antanas in her one good arm and trying to soothe\r\nhim to sleep. In another corner crouched poor little Juozapas, wailing\r\nbecause he had had nothing to eat all day. Marija said not a word to\r\nJurgis; he crept in like a whipped cur, and went and sat down by the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he ought to have meditated upon the hunger of the children, and\r\nupon his own baseness; but he thought only of Ona, he gave himself up\r\nagain to the luxury of grief. He shed no tears, being ashamed to make a\r\nsound; he sat motionless and shuddering with his anguish. He had never\r\ndreamed how much he loved Ona, until now that she was gone; until now\r\nthat he sat here, knowing that on the morrow they would take her away,\r\nand that he would never lay eyes upon her again\xe2\x80\x94never all the days of\r\nhis life. His old love, which had been starved to death, beaten to\r\ndeath, awoke in him again; the floodgates of memory were lifted\xe2\x80\x94he saw\r\nall their life together, saw her as he had seen her in Lithuania, the\r\nfirst day at the fair, beautiful as the flowers, singing like a bird.\r\nHe saw her as he had married her, with all her tenderness, with her\r\nheart of wonder; the very words she had spoken seemed to ring now in\r\nhis ears, the tears she had shed to be wet upon his cheek. The long,\r\ncruel battle with misery and hunger had hardened and embittered him,\r\nbut it had not changed her\xe2\x80\x94she had been the same hungry soul to the\r\nend, stretching out her arms to him, pleading with him, begging him for\r\nlove and tenderness. And she had suffered\xe2\x80\x94so cruelly she had suffered,\r\nsuch agonies, such infamies\xe2\x80\x94ah, God, the memory of them was not to be\r\nborne. What a monster of wickedness, of heartlessness, he had been!\r\nEvery angry word that he had ever spoken came back to him and cut him\r\nlike a knife; every selfish act that he had done\xe2\x80\x94with what torments he\r\npaid for them now! And such devotion and awe as welled up in his\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x94now that it could never be spoken, now that it was too late, too\r\nlate! His bosom-was choking with it, bursting with it; he crouched here\r\nin the darkness beside her, stretching out his arms to her\xe2\x80\x94and she was\r\ngone forever, she was dead! He could have screamed aloud with the\r\nhorror and despair of it; a sweat of agony beaded his forehead, yet he\r\ndared not make a sound\xe2\x80\x94he scarcely dared to breathe, because of his\r\nshame and loathing of himself.\r\n\r\nLate at night came Elzbieta, having gotten the money for a mass, and\r\npaid for it in advance, lest she should be tempted too sorely at home.\r\nShe brought also a bit of stale rye bread that some one had given her,\r\nand with that they quieted the children and got them to sleep. Then she\r\ncame over to Jurgis and sat down beside him.\r\n\r\nShe said not a word of reproach\xe2\x80\x94she and Marija had chosen that course\r\nbefore; she would only plead with him, here by the corpse of his dead\r\nwife. Already Elzbieta had choked down her tears, grief being crowded\r\nout of her soul by fear. She had to bury one of her children\xe2\x80\x94but then\r\nshe had done it three times before, and each time risen up and gone\r\nback to take up the battle for the rest. Elzbieta was one of the\r\nprimitive creatures: like the angleworm, which goes on living though\r\ncut in half; like a hen, which, deprived of her chickens one by one,\r\nwill mother the last that is left her. She did this because it was her\r\nnature\xe2\x80\x94she asked no questions about the justice of it, nor the\r\nworth-whileness of life in which destruction and death ran riot.\r\n\r\nAnd this old common-sense view she labored to impress upon Jurgis,\r\npleading with him with tears in her eyes. Ona was dead, but the others\r\nwere left and they must be saved. She did not ask for her own children.\r\nShe and Marija could care for them somehow, but there was Antanas, his\r\nown son. Ona had given Antanas to him\xe2\x80\x94the little fellow was the only\r\nremembrance of her that he had; he must treasure it and protect it, he\r\nmust show himself a man. He knew what Ona would have had him do, what\r\nshe would ask of him at this moment, if she could speak to him. It was\r\na terrible thing that she should have died as she had; but the life had\r\nbeen too hard for her, and she had to go. It was terrible that they\r\nwere not able to bury her, that he could not even have a day to mourn\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94but so it was. Their fate was pressing; they had not a cent, and\r\nthe children would perish\xe2\x80\x94some money must be had. Could he not be a man\r\nfor Ona\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and pull himself together? In a little while they would\r\nbe out of danger\xe2\x80\x94now that they had given up the house they could live\r\nmore cheaply, and with all the children working they could get along,\r\nif only he would not go to pieces. So Elzbieta went on, with feverish\r\nintensity. It was a struggle for life with her; she was not afraid that\r\nJurgis would go on drinking, for he had no money for that, but she was\r\nwild with dread at the thought that he might desert them, might take to\r\nthe road, as Jonas had done.\r\n\r\nBut with Ona\xe2\x80\x99s dead body beneath his eyes, Jurgis could not well think\r\nof treason to his child. Yes, he said, he would try, for the sake of\r\nAntanas. He would give the little fellow his chance\xe2\x80\x94would get to work\r\nat once, yes, tomorrow, without even waiting for Ona to be buried. They\r\nmight trust him, he would keep his word, come what might.\r\n\r\nAnd so he was out before daylight the next morning, headache,\r\nheartache, and all. He went straight to Graham\xe2\x80\x99s fertilizer mill, to\r\nsee if he could get back his job. But the boss shook his head when he\r\nsaw him\xe2\x80\x94no, his place had been filled long ago, and there was no room\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think there will be?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI may have to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cit will not be worth your while to wait\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwill be nothing for you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis stood gazing at him in perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I do my work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other met his look with one of cold indifference, and answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be nothing for you here, I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis had his suspicions as to the dreadful meaning of that incident,\r\nand he went away with a sinking at the heart. He went and took his\r\nstand with the mob of hungry wretches who were standing about in the\r\nsnow before the time station. Here he stayed, breakfastless, for two\r\nhours, until the throng was driven away by the clubs of the police.\r\nThere was no work for him that day.\r\n\r\nJurgis had made a good many acquaintances in his long services at the\r\nyards\xe2\x80\x94there were saloonkeepers who would trust him for a drink and a\r\nsandwich, and members of his old union who would lend him a dime at a\r\npinch. It was not a question of life and death for him, therefore; he\r\nmight hunt all day, and come again on the morrow, and try hanging on\r\nthus for weeks, like hundreds and thousands of others. Meantime, Teta\r\nElzbieta would go and beg, over in the Hyde Park district, and the\r\nchildren would bring home enough to pacify Aniele, and keep them all\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of a week of this sort of waiting, roaming about in\r\nthe bitter winds or loafing in saloons, that Jurgis stumbled on a\r\nchance in one of the cellars of Jones\xe2\x80\x99s big packing plant. He saw a\r\nforeman passing the open doorway, and hailed him for a job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPush a truck?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the man, and Jurgis answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbefore the words were well out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJurgis Rudkus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorked in the yards before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereabouts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo places\xe2\x80\x94Brown\xe2\x80\x99s killing beds and Durham\xe2\x80\x99s fertilizer mill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you leave there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first time I had an accident, and the last time I was sent up for\r\na month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a trial. Come early tomorrow and ask for\r\nMr. Thomas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis rushed home with the wild tidings that he had a job\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\nterrible siege was over. The remnants of the family had quite a\r\ncelebration that night; and in the morning Jurgis was at the place half\r\nan hour before the time of opening. The foreman came in shortly\r\nafterward, and when he saw Jurgis he frowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI promised you a job, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I made a mistake. I can\xe2\x80\x99t use you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis stared, dumfounded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9conly I can\xe2\x80\x99t use you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was the same cold, hostile stare that he had had from the boss of\r\nthe fertilizer mill. He knew that there was no use in saying a word,\r\nand he turned and went away.\r\n\r\nOut in the saloons the men could tell him all about the meaning of it;\r\nthey gazed at him with pitying eyes\xe2\x80\x94poor devil, he was blacklisted!\r\nWhat had he done? they asked\xe2\x80\x94knocked down his boss? Good heavens, then\r\nhe might have known! Why, he stood as much chance of getting a job in\r\nPackingtown as of being chosen mayor of Chicago. Why had he wasted his\r\ntime hunting? They had him on a secret list in every office, big and\r\nlittle, in the place. They had his name by this time in St. Louis and\r\nNew York, in Omaha and Boston, in Kansas City and St. Joseph. He was\r\ncondemned and sentenced, without trial and without appeal; he could\r\nnever work for the packers again\xe2\x80\x94he could not even clean cattle pens or\r\ndrive a truck in any place where they controlled. He might try it, if\r\nhe chose, as hundreds had tried it, and found out for themselves. He\r\nwould never be told anything about it; he would never get any more\r\nsatisfaction than he had gotten just now; but he would always find when\r\nthe time came that he was not needed. It would not do for him to give\r\nany other name, either\xe2\x80\x94they had company \xe2\x80\x9cspotters\xe2\x80\x9d for just that\r\npurpose, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a job in Packingtown three days. It was\r\nworth a fortune to the packers to keep their blacklist effective, as a\r\nwarning to the men and a means of keeping down union agitation and\r\npolitical discontent.\r\n\r\nJurgis went home, carrying these new tidings to the family council. It\r\nwas a most cruel thing; here in this district was his home, such as it\r\nwas, the place he was used to and the friends he knew\xe2\x80\x94and now every\r\npossibility of employment in it was closed to him. There was nothing in\r\nPackingtown but packing houses; and so it was the same thing as\r\nevicting him from his home.\r\n\r\nHe and the two women spent all day and half the night discussing it. It\r\nwould be convenient, downtown, to the children\xe2\x80\x99s place of work; but\r\nthen Marija was on the road to recovery, and had hopes of getting a job\r\nin the yards; and though she did not see her old-time lover once a\r\nmonth, because of the misery of their state, yet she could not make up\r\nher mind to go away and give him up forever. Then, too, Elzbieta had\r\nheard something about a chance to scrub floors in Durham\xe2\x80\x99s offices and\r\nwas waiting every day for word. In the end it was decided that Jurgis\r\nshould go downtown to strike out for himself, and they would decide\r\nafter he got a job. As there was no one from whom he could borrow\r\nthere, and he dared not beg for fear of being arrested, it was arranged\r\nthat every day he should meet one of the children and be given fifteen\r\ncents of their earnings, upon which he could keep going. Then all day\r\nhe was to pace the streets with hundreds and thousands of other\r\nhomeless wretches inquiring at stores, warehouses, and factories for a\r\nchance; and at night he was to crawl into some doorway or underneath a\r\ntruck, and hide there until midnight, when he might get into one of the\r\nstation houses, and spread a newspaper upon the floor, and lie down in\r\nthe midst of a throng of \xe2\x80\x9cbums\xe2\x80\x9d and beggars, reeking with alcohol and\r\ntobacco, and filthy with vermin and disease.\r\n\r\nSo for two weeks more Jurgis fought with the demon of despair. Once he\r\ngot a chance to load a truck for half a day, and again he carried an\r\nold woman\xe2\x80\x99s valise and was given a quarter. This let him into a\r\nlodging-house on several nights when he might otherwise have frozen to\r\ndeath; and it also gave him a chance now and then to buy a newspaper in\r\nthe morning and hunt up jobs while his rivals were watching and waiting\r\nfor a paper to be thrown away. This, however, was really not the\r\nadvantage it seemed, for the newspaper advertisements were a cause of\r\nmuch loss of precious time and of many weary journeys. A full half of\r\nthese were \xe2\x80\x9cfakes,\xe2\x80\x9d put in by the endless variety of establishments\r\nwhich preyed upon the helpless ignorance of the unemployed. If Jurgis\r\nlost only his time, it was because he had nothing else to lose;\r\nwhenever a smooth-tongued agent would tell him of the wonderful\r\npositions he had on hand, he could only shake his head sorrowfully and\r\nsay that he had not the necessary dollar to deposit; when it was\r\nexplained to him what \xe2\x80\x9cbig money\xe2\x80\x9d he and all his family could make by\r\ncoloring photographs, he could only promise to come in again when he\r\nhad two dollars to invest in the outfit.\r\n\r\nIn the end Jurgis got a chance through an accidental meeting with an\r\nold-time acquaintance of his union days. He met this man on his way to\r\nwork in the giant factories of the Harvester Trust; and his friend told\r\nhim to come along and he would speak a good word for him to his boss,\r\nwhom he knew well. So Jurgis trudged four or five miles, and passed\r\nthrough a waiting throng of unemployed at the gate under the escort of\r\nhis friend. His knees nearly gave way beneath him when the foreman,\r\nafter looking him over and questioning him, told him that he could find\r\nan opening for him.\r\n\r\nHow much this accident meant to Jurgis he realized only by stages; for\r\nhe found that the harvester works were the sort of place to which\r\nphilanthropists and reformers pointed with pride. It had some thought\r\nfor its employees; its workshops were big and roomy, it provided a\r\nrestaurant where the workmen could buy good food at cost, it had even a\r\nreading room, and decent places where its girl-hands could rest; also\r\nthe work was free from many of the elements of filth and repulsiveness\r\nthat prevailed at the stockyards. Day after day Jurgis discovered these\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94things never expected nor dreamed of by him\xe2\x80\x94until this new place\r\ncame to seem a kind of a heaven to him.\r\n\r\nIt was an enormous establishment, covering a hundred and sixty acres of\r\nground, employing five thousand people, and turning out over three\r\nhundred thousand machines every year\xe2\x80\x94a good part of all the harvesting\r\nand mowing machines used in the country. Jurgis saw very little of it,\r\nof course\xe2\x80\x94it was all specialized work, the same as at the stockyards;\r\neach one of the hundreds of parts of a mowing machine was made\r\nseparately, and sometimes handled by hundreds of men. Where Jurgis\r\nworked there was a machine which cut and stamped a certain piece of\r\nsteel about two square inches in size; the pieces came tumbling out\r\nupon a tray, and all that human hands had to do was to pile them in\r\nregular rows, and change the trays at intervals. This was done by a\r\nsingle boy, who stood with eyes and thought centered upon it, and\r\nfingers flying so fast that the sounds of the bits of steel striking\r\nupon each other was like the music of an express train as one hears it\r\nin a sleeping car at night. This was \xe2\x80\x9cpiece-work,\xe2\x80\x9d of course; and\r\nbesides it was made certain that the boy did not idle, by setting the\r\nmachine to match the highest possible speed of human hands. Thirty\r\nthousand of these pieces he handled every day, nine or ten million\r\nevery year\xe2\x80\x94how many in a lifetime it rested with the gods to say. Near\r\nby him men sat bending over whirling grindstones, putting the finishing\r\ntouches to the steel knives of the reaper; picking them out of a basket\r\nwith the right hand, pressing first one side and then the other against\r\nthe stone and finally dropping them with the left hand into another\r\nbasket. One of these men told Jurgis that he had sharpened three\r\nthousand pieces of steel a day for thirteen years. In the next room\r\nwere wonderful machines that ate up long steel rods by slow stages,\r\ncutting them off, seizing the pieces, stamping heads upon them,\r\ngrinding them and polishing them, threading them, and finally dropping\r\nthem into a basket, all ready to bolt the harvesters together. From yet\r\nanother machine came tens of thousands of steel burs to fit upon these\r\nbolts. In other places all these various parts were dipped into troughs\r\nof paint and hung up to dry, and then slid along on trolleys to a room\r\nwhere men streaked them with red and yellow, so that they might look\r\ncheerful in the harvest fields.\r\n\r\nJurgis\xe2\x80\x99s friend worked upstairs in the casting rooms, and his task was\r\nto make the molds of a certain part. He shoveled black sand into an\r\niron receptacle and pounded it tight and set it aside to harden; then\r\nit would be taken out, and molten iron poured into it. This man, too,\r\nwas paid by the mold\xe2\x80\x94or rather for perfect castings, nearly half his\r\nwork going for naught. You might see him, along with dozens of others,\r\ntoiling like one possessed by a whole community of demons; his arms\r\nworking like the driving rods of an engine, his long, black hair flying\r\nwild, his eyes starting out, the sweat rolling in rivers down his face.\r\nWhen he had shoveled the mold full of sand, and reached for the pounder\r\nto pound it with, it was after the manner of a canoeist running rapids\r\nand seizing a pole at sight of a submerged rock. All day long this man\r\nwould toil thus, his whole being centered upon the purpose of making\r\ntwenty-three instead of twenty-two and a half cents an hour; and then\r\nhis product would be reckoned up by the census taker, and jubilant\r\ncaptains of industry would boast of it in their banquet halls, telling\r\nhow our workers are nearly twice as efficient as those of any other\r\ncountry. If we are the greatest nation the sun ever shone upon, it\r\nwould seem to be mainly because we have been able to goad our\r\nwage-earners to this pitch of frenzy; though there are a few other\r\nthings that are great among us including our drink-bill, which is a\r\nbillion and a quarter of dollars a year, and doubling itself every\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\nThere was a machine which stamped out the iron plates, and then another\r\nwhich, with a mighty thud, mashed them to the shape of the sitting-down\r\nportion of the American farmer. Then they were piled upon a truck, and\r\nit was Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s task to wheel them to the room where the machines were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cassembled.\xe2\x80\x9d This was child\xe2\x80\x99s play for him, and he got a dollar and\r\nseventy-five cents a day for it; on Saturday he paid Aniele the\r\nseventy-five cents a week he owed her for the use of her garret, and\r\nalso redeemed his overcoat, which Elzbieta had put in pawn when he was\r\nin jail.\r\n\r\nThis last was a great blessing. A man cannot go about in midwinter in\r\nChicago with no overcoat and not pay for it, and Jurgis had to walk or\r\nride five or six miles back and forth to his work. It so happened that\r\nhalf of this was in one direction and half in another, necessitating a\r\nchange of cars; the law required that transfers be given at all\r\nintersecting points, but the railway corporation had gotten round this\r\nby arranging a pretense at separate ownership. So whenever he wished to\r\nride, he had to pay ten cents each way, or over ten per cent of his\r\nincome to this power, which had gotten its franchises long ago by\r\nbuying up the city council, in the face of popular clamor amounting\r\nalmost to a rebellion. Tired as he felt at night, and dark and bitter\r\ncold as it was in the morning, Jurgis generally chose to walk; at the\r\nhours other workmen were traveling, the streetcar monopoly saw fit to\r\nput on so few cars that there would be men hanging to every foot of the\r\nbacks of them and often crouching upon the snow-covered roof. Of course\r\nthe doors could never be closed, and so the cars were as cold as\r\noutdoors; Jurgis, like many others, found it better to spend his fare\r\nfor a drink and a free lunch, to give him strength to walk.\r\n\r\nThese, however, were all slight matters to a man who had escaped from\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s fertilizer mill. Jurgis began to pick up heart again and to\r\nmake plans. He had lost his house but then the awful load of the rent\r\nand interest was off his shoulders, and when Marija was well again they\r\ncould start over and save. In the shop where he worked was a man, a\r\nLithuanian like himself, whom the others spoke of in admiring whispers,\r\nbecause of the mighty feats he was performing. All day he sat at a\r\nmachine turning bolts; and then in the evening he went to the public\r\nschool to study English and learn to read. In addition, because he had\r\na family of eight children to support and his earnings were not enough,\r\non Saturdays and Sundays he served as a watchman; he was required to\r\npress two buttons at opposite ends of a building every five minutes,\r\nand as the walk only took him two minutes, he had three minutes to\r\nstudy between each trip. Jurgis felt jealous of this fellow; for that\r\nwas the sort of thing he himself had dreamed of, two or three years\r\nago. He might do it even yet, if he had a fair chance\xe2\x80\x94he might attract\r\nattention and become a skilled man or a boss, as some had done in this\r\nplace. Suppose that Marija could get a job in the big mill where they\r\nmade binder twine\xe2\x80\x94then they would move into this neighborhood, and he\r\nwould really have a chance. With a hope like that, there was some use\r\nin living; to find a place where you were treated like a human being\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nGod! he would show them how he could appreciate it. He laughed to\r\nhimself as he thought how he would hang on to this job!\r\n\r\nAnd then one afternoon, the ninth of his work in the place, when he\r\nwent to get his overcoat he saw a group of men crowded before a placard\r\non the door, and when he went over and asked what it was, they told him\r\nthat beginning with the morrow his department of the harvester works\r\nwould be closed until further notice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the way they did it! There was not half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s warning\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nworks were closed! It had happened that way before, said the men, and\r\nit would happen that way forever. They had made all the harvesting\r\nmachines that the world needed, and now they had to wait till some wore\r\nout! It was nobody\xe2\x80\x99s fault\xe2\x80\x94that was the way of it; and thousands of men\r\nand women were turned out in the dead of winter, to live upon their\r\nsavings if they had any, and otherwise to die. So many tens of\r\nthousands already in the city, homeless and begging for work, and now\r\nseveral thousand more added to them!\r\n\r\nJurgis walked home-with his pittance of pay in his pocket, heartbroken,\r\noverwhelmed. One more bandage had been torn from his eyes, one more\r\npitfall was revealed to him! Of what help was kindness and decency on\r\nthe part of employers\xe2\x80\x94when they could not keep a job for him, when\r\nthere were more harvesting machines made than the world was able to\r\nbuy! What a hellish mockery it was, anyway, that a man should slave to\r\nmake harvesting machines for the country, only to be turned out to\r\nstarve for doing his duty too well!\r\n\r\nIt took him two days to get over this heart-sickening disappointment.\r\nHe did not drink anything, because Elzbieta got his money for\r\nsafekeeping, and knew him too well to be in the least frightened by his\r\nangry demands. He stayed up in the garret however, and sulked\xe2\x80\x94what was\r\nthe use of a man\xe2\x80\x99s hunting a job when it was taken from him before he\r\nhad time to learn the work? But then their money was going again, and\r\nlittle Antanas was hungry, and crying with the bitter cold of the\r\ngarret. Also Madame Haupt, the midwife, was after him for some money.\r\nSo he went out once more.\r\n\r\nFor another ten days he roamed the streets and alleys of the huge city,\r\nsick and hungry, begging for any work. He tried in stores and offices,\r\nin restaurants and hotels, along the docks and in the railroad yards,\r\nin warehouses and mills and factories where they made products that\r\nwent to every corner of the world. There were often one or two\r\nchances\xe2\x80\x94but there were always a hundred men for every chance, and his\r\nturn would not come. At night he crept into sheds and cellars and\r\ndoorways\xe2\x80\x94until there came a spell of belated winter weather, with a\r\nraging gale, and the thermometer five degrees below zero at sundown and\r\nfalling all night. Then Jurgis fought like a wild beast to get into the\r\nbig Harrison Street police station, and slept down in a corridor,\r\ncrowded with two other men upon a single step.\r\n\r\nHe had to fight often in these days to fight for a place near the\r\nfactory gates, and now and again with gangs on the street. He found,\r\nfor instance, that the business of carrying satchels for railroad\r\npassengers was a pre-empted one\xe2\x80\x94whenever he essayed it, eight or ten\r\nmen and boys would fall upon him and force him to run for his life.\r\nThey always had the policeman \xe2\x80\x9csquared,\xe2\x80\x9d and so there was no use in\r\nexpecting protection.\r\n\r\nThat Jurgis did not starve to death was due solely to the pittance the\r\nchildren brought him. And even this was never certain. For one thing\r\nthe cold was almost more than the children could bear; and then they,\r\ntoo, were in perpetual peril from rivals who plundered and beat them.\r\nThe law was against them, too\xe2\x80\x94little Vilimas, who was really eleven,\r\nbut did not look to be eight, was stopped on the streets by a severe\r\nold lady in spectacles, who told him that he was too young to be\r\nworking and that if he did not stop selling papers she would send a\r\ntruant officer after him. Also one night a strange man caught little\r\nKotrina by the arm and tried to persuade her into a dark cellar-way, an\r\nexperience which filled her with such terror that she was hardly to be\r\nkept at work.\r\n\r\nAt last, on a Sunday, as there was no use looking for work, Jurgis went\r\nhome by stealing rides on the cars. He found that they had been waiting\r\nfor him for three days\xe2\x80\x94there was a chance of a job for him.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a story. Little Juozapas, who was near crazy with hunger\r\nthese days, had gone out on the street to beg for himself. Juozapas had\r\nonly one leg, having been run over by a wagon when a little child, but\r\nhe had got himself a broomstick, which he put under his arm for a\r\ncrutch. He had fallen in with some other children and found the way to\r\nMike Scully\xe2\x80\x99s dump, which lay three or four blocks away. To this place\r\nthere came every day many hundreds of wagon-loads of garbage and trash\r\nfrom the lake front, where the rich people lived; and in the heaps the\r\nchildren raked for food\xe2\x80\x94there were hunks of bread and potato peelings\r\nand apple cores and meat bones, all of it half frozen and quite\r\nunspoiled. Little Juozapas gorged himself, and came home with a\r\nnewspaper full, which he was feeding to Antanas when his mother came\r\nin. Elzbieta was horrified, for she did not believe that the food out\r\nof the dumps was fit to eat. The next day, however, when no harm came\r\nof it and Juozapas began to cry with hunger, she gave in and said that\r\nhe might go again. And that afternoon he came home with a story of how\r\nwhile he had been digging away with a stick, a lady upon the street had\r\ncalled him. A real fine lady, the little boy explained, a beautiful\r\nlady; and she wanted to know all about him, and whether he got the\r\ngarbage for chickens, and why he walked with a broomstick, and why Ona\r\nhad died, and how Jurgis had come to go to jail, and what was the\r\nmatter with Marija, and everything. In the end she had asked where he\r\nlived, and said that she was coming to see him, and bring him a new\r\ncrutch to walk with. She had on a hat with a bird upon it, Juozapas\r\nadded, and a long fur snake around her neck.\r\n\r\nShe really came, the very next morning, and climbed the ladder to the\r\ngarret, and stood and stared about her, turning pale at the sight of\r\nthe blood stains on the floor where Ona had died. She was a \xe2\x80\x9csettlement\r\nworker,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained to Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x94she lived around on Ashland Avenue.\r\nElzbieta knew the place, over a feed store; somebody had wanted her to\r\ngo there, but she had not cared to, for she thought that it must have\r\nsomething to do with religion, and the priest did not like her to have\r\nanything to do with strange religions. They were rich people who came\r\nto live there to find out about the poor people; but what good they\r\nexpected it would do them to know, one could not imagine. So spoke\r\nElzbieta, na\xc3\xafvely, and the young lady laughed and was rather at a loss\r\nfor an answer\xe2\x80\x94she stood and gazed about her, and thought of a cynical\r\nremark that had been made to her, that she was standing upon the brink\r\nof the pit of hell and throwing in snowballs to lower the temperature.\r\n\r\nElzbieta was glad to have somebody to listen, and she told all their\r\nwoes\xe2\x80\x94what had happened to Ona, and the jail, and the loss of their\r\nhome, and Marija\xe2\x80\x99s accident, and how Ona had died, and how Jurgis could\r\nget no work. As she listened the pretty young lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes filled with\r\ntears, and in the midst of it she burst into weeping and hid her face\r\non Elzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, quite regardless of the fact that the woman had\r\non a dirty old wrapper and that the garret was full of fleas. Poor\r\nElzbieta was ashamed of herself for having told so woeful a tale, and\r\nthe other had to beg and plead with her to get her to go on. The end of\r\nit was that the young lady sent them a basket of things to eat, and\r\nleft a letter that Jurgis was to take to a gentleman who was\r\nsuperintendent in one of the mills of the great steelworks in South\r\nChicago. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will get Jurgis something to do,\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady had said,\r\nand added, smiling through her tears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, he will never\r\nmarry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe steel-works were fifteen miles away, and as usual it was so\r\ncontrived that one had to pay two fares to get there. Far and wide the\r\nsky was flaring with the red glare that leaped from rows of towering\r\nchimneys\xe2\x80\x94for it was pitch dark when Jurgis arrived. The vast works, a\r\ncity in themselves, were surrounded by a stockade; and already a full\r\nhundred men were waiting at the gate where new hands were taken on.\r\nSoon after daybreak whistles began to blow, and then suddenly thousands\r\nof men appeared, streaming from saloons and boardinghouses across the\r\nway, leaping from trolley cars that passed\xe2\x80\x94it seemed as if they rose\r\nout of the ground, in the dim gray light. A river of them poured in\r\nthrough the gate\xe2\x80\x94and then gradually ebbed away again, until there were\r\nonly a few late ones running, and the watchman pacing up and down, and\r\nthe hungry strangers stamping and shivering.\r\n\r\nJurgis presented his precious letter. The gatekeeper was surly, and put\r\nhim through a catechism, but he insisted that he knew nothing, and as\r\nhe had taken the precaution to seal his letter, there was nothing for\r\nthe gatekeeper to do but send it to the person to whom it was\r\naddressed. A messenger came back to say that Jurgis should wait, and so\r\nhe came inside of the gate, perhaps not sorry enough that there were\r\nothers less fortunate watching him with greedy eyes. The great mills\r\nwere getting under way\xe2\x80\x94one could hear a vast stirring, a rolling and\r\nrumbling and hammering. Little by little the scene grew plain:\r\ntowering, black buildings here and there, long rows of shops and sheds,\r\nlittle railways branching everywhere, bare gray cinders underfoot and\r\noceans of billowing black smoke above. On one side of the grounds ran a\r\nrailroad with a dozen tracks, and on the other side lay the lake, where\r\nsteamers came to load.\r\n\r\nJurgis had time enough to stare and speculate, for it was two hours\r\nbefore he was summoned. He went into the office building, where a\r\ncompany timekeeper interviewed him. The superintendent was busy, he\r\nsaid, but he (the timekeeper) would try to find Jurgis a job. He had\r\nnever worked in a steel mill before? But he was ready for anything?\r\nWell, then, they would go and see.\r\n\r\nSo they began a tour, among sights that made Jurgis stare amazed. He\r\nwondered if ever he could get used to working in a place like this,\r\nwhere the air shook with deafening thunder, and whistles shrieked\r\nwarnings on all sides of him at once; where miniature steam engines\r\ncame rushing upon him, and sizzling, quivering, white-hot masses of\r\nmetal sped past him, and explosions of fire and flaming sparks dazzled\r\nhim and scorched his face. The men in these mills were all black with\r\nsoot, and hollow-eyed and gaunt; they worked with fierce intensity,\r\nrushing here and there, and never lifting their eyes from their tasks.\r\nJurgis clung to his guide like a scared child to its nurse, and while\r\nthe latter hailed one foreman after another to ask if they could use\r\nanother unskilled man, he stared about him and marveled.\r\n\r\nHe was taken to the Bessemer furnace, where they made billets of\r\nsteel\xe2\x80\x94a dome-like building, the size of a big theater. Jurgis stood\r\nwhere the balcony of the theater would have been, and opposite, by the\r\nstage, he saw three giant caldrons, big enough for all the devils of\r\nhell to brew their broth in, full of something white and blinding,\r\nbubbling and splashing, roaring as if volcanoes were blowing through\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94one had to shout to be heard in the place. Liquid fire would leap\r\nfrom these caldrons and scatter like bombs below\xe2\x80\x94and men were working\r\nthere, seeming careless, so that Jurgis caught his breath with fright.\r\nThen a whistle would toot, and across the curtain of the theater would\r\ncome a little engine with a carload of something to be dumped into one\r\nof the receptacles; and then another whistle would toot, down by the\r\nstage, and another train would back up\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly, without an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x99s warning, one of the giant kettles began to tilt and topple,\r\nflinging out a jet of hissing, roaring flame. Jurgis shrank back\r\nappalled, for he thought it was an accident; there fell a pillar of\r\nwhite flame, dazzling as the sun, swishing like a huge tree falling in\r\nthe forest. A torrent of sparks swept all the way across the building,\r\noverwhelming everything, hiding it from sight; and then Jurgis looked\r\nthrough the fingers of his hands, and saw pouring out of the caldron a\r\ncascade of living, leaping fire, white with a whiteness not of earth,\r\nscorching the eyeballs. Incandescent rainbows shone above it, blue,\r\nred, and golden lights played about it; but the stream itself was\r\nwhite, ineffable. Out of regions of wonder it streamed, the very river\r\nof life; and the soul leaped up at the sight of it, fled back upon it,\r\nswift and resistless, back into far-off lands, where beauty and terror\r\ndwell. Then the great caldron tilted back again, empty, and Jurgis saw\r\nto his relief that no one was hurt, and turned and followed his guide\r\nout into the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThey went through the blast furnaces, through rolling mills where bars\r\nof steel were tossed about and chopped like bits of cheese. All around\r\nand above giant machine arms were flying, giant wheels were turning,\r\ngreat hammers crashing; traveling cranes creaked and groaned overhead,\r\nreaching down iron hands and seizing iron prey\xe2\x80\x94it was like standing in\r\nthe center of the earth, where the machinery of time was revolving.\r\n\r\nBy and by they came to the place where steel rails were made; and\r\nJurgis heard a toot behind him, and jumped out of the way of a car with\r\na white-hot ingot upon it, the size of a man\xe2\x80\x99s body. There was a sudden\r\ncrash and the car came to a halt, and the ingot toppled out upon a\r\nmoving platform, where steel fingers and arms seized hold of it,\r\npunching it and prodding it into place, and hurrying it into the grip\r\nof huge rollers. Then it came out upon the other side, and there were\r\nmore crashings and clatterings, and over it was flopped, like a pancake\r\non a gridiron, and seized again and rushed back at you through another\r\nsqueezer. So amid deafening uproar it clattered to and fro, growing\r\nthinner and flatter and longer. The ingot seemed almost a living thing;\r\nit did not want to run this mad course, but it was in the grip of fate,\r\nit was tumbled on, screeching and clanking and shivering in protest. By\r\nand by it was long and thin, a great red snake escaped from purgatory;\r\nand then, as it slid through the rollers, you would have sworn that it\r\nwas alive\xe2\x80\x94it writhed and squirmed, and wriggles and shudders passed out\r\nthrough its tail, all but flinging it off by their violence. There was\r\nno rest for it until it was cold and black\xe2\x80\x94and then it needed only to\r\nbe cut and straightened to be ready for a railroad.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of this rail\xe2\x80\x99s progress that Jurgis got his chance.\r\nThey had to be moved by men with crowbars, and the boss here could use\r\nanother man. So he took off his coat and set to work on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt took him two hours to get to this place every day and cost him a\r\ndollar and twenty cents a week. As this was out of the question, he\r\nwrapped his bedding in a bundle and took it with him, and one of his\r\nfellow workingmen introduced him to a Polish lodging-house, where he\r\nmight have the privilege of sleeping upon the floor for ten cents a\r\nnight. He got his meals at free-lunch counters, and every Saturday\r\nnight he went home\xe2\x80\x94bedding and all\xe2\x80\x94and took the greater part of his\r\nmoney to the family. Elzbieta was sorry for this arrangement, for she\r\nfeared that it would get him into the habit of living without them, and\r\nonce a week was not very often for him to see his baby; but there was\r\nno other way of arranging it. There was no chance for a woman at the\r\nsteelworks, and Marija was now ready for work again, and lured on from\r\nday to day by the hope of finding it at the yards.\r\n\r\nIn a week Jurgis got over his sense of helplessness and bewilderment in\r\nthe rail mill. He learned to find his way about and to take all the\r\nmiracles and terrors for granted, to work without hearing the rumbling\r\nand crashing. From blind fear he went to the other extreme; he became\r\nreckless and indifferent, like all the rest of the men, who took but\r\nlittle thought of themselves in the ardor of their work. It was\r\nwonderful, when one came to think of it, that these men should have\r\ntaken an interest in the work they did\xe2\x80\x94they had no share in it\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwere paid by the hour, and paid no more for being interested. Also they\r\nknew that if they were hurt they would be flung aside and forgotten\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nstill they would hurry to their task by dangerous short cuts, would use\r\nmethods that were quicker and more effective in spite of the fact that\r\nthey were also risky. His fourth day at his work Jurgis saw a man\r\nstumble while running in front of a car, and have his foot mashed off,\r\nand before he had been there three weeks he was witness of a yet more\r\ndreadful accident. There was a row of brick furnaces, shining white\r\nthrough every crack with the molten steel inside. Some of these were\r\nbulging dangerously, yet men worked before them, wearing blue glasses\r\nwhen they opened and shut the doors. One morning as Jurgis was passing,\r\na furnace blew out, spraying two men with a shower of liquid fire. As\r\nthey lay screaming and rolling upon the ground in agony, Jurgis rushed\r\nto help them, and as a result he lost a good part of the skin from the\r\ninside of one of his hands. The company doctor bandaged it up, but he\r\ngot no other thanks from any one, and was laid up for eight working\r\ndays without any pay.\r\n\r\nMost fortunately, at this juncture, Elzbieta got the long-awaited\r\nchance to go at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning and help scrub the office\r\nfloors of one of the packers. Jurgis came home and covered himself with\r\nblankets to keep warm, and divided his time between sleeping and\r\nplaying with little Antanas. Juozapas was away raking in the dump a\r\ngood part of the time, and Elzbieta and Marija were hunting for more\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAntanas was now over a year and a half old, and was a perfect talking\r\nmachine. He learned so fast that every week when Jurgis came home it\r\nseemed to him as if he had a new child. He would sit down and listen\r\nand stare at him, and give vent to delighted exclamations\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Palauk!\r\nMuma! Tu mano szirdele!_\xe2\x80\x9d The little fellow was now really the one\r\ndelight that Jurgis had in the world\xe2\x80\x94his one hope, his one victory.\r\nThank God, Antanas was a boy! And he was as tough as a pine knot, and\r\nwith the appetite of a wolf. Nothing had hurt him, and nothing could\r\nhurt him; he had come through all the suffering and deprivation\r\nunscathed\xe2\x80\x94only shriller-voiced and more determined in his grip upon\r\nlife. He was a terrible child to manage, was Antanas, but his father\r\ndid not mind that\xe2\x80\x94he would watch him and smile to himself with\r\nsatisfaction. The more of a fighter he was the better\xe2\x80\x94he would need to\r\nfight before he got through.\r\n\r\nJurgis had got the habit of buying the Sunday paper whenever he had the\r\nmoney; a most wonderful paper could be had for only five cents, a whole\r\narmful, with all the news of the world set forth in big headlines, that\r\nJurgis could spell out slowly, with the children to help him at the\r\nlong words. There was battle and murder and sudden death\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nmarvelous how they ever heard about so many entertaining and thrilling\r\nhappenings; the stories must be all true, for surely no man could have\r\nmade such things up, and besides, there were pictures of them all, as\r\nreal as life. One of these papers was as good as a circus, and nearly\r\nas good as a spree\xe2\x80\x94certainly a most wonderful treat for a workingman,\r\nwho was tired out and stupefied, and had never had any education, and\r\nwhose work was one dull, sordid grind, day after day, and year after\r\nyear, with never a sight of a green field nor an hour\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment,\r\nnor anything but liquor to stimulate his imagination. Among other\r\nthings, these papers had pages full of comical pictures, and these were\r\nthe main joy in life to little Antanas. He treasured them up, and would\r\ndrag them out and make his father tell him about them; there were all\r\nsorts of animals among them, and Antanas could tell the names of all of\r\nthem, lying upon the floor for hours and pointing them out with his\r\nchubby little fingers. Whenever the story was plain enough for Jurgis\r\nto make out, Antanas would have it repeated to him, and then he would\r\nremember it, prattling funny little sentences and mixing it up with\r\nother stories in an irresistible fashion. Also his quaint pronunciation\r\nof words was such a delight\xe2\x80\x94and the phrases he would pick up and\r\nremember, the most outlandish and impossible things! The first time\r\nthat the little rascal burst out with \xe2\x80\x9cGod damn,\xe2\x80\x9d his father nearly\r\nrolled off the chair with glee; but in the end he was sorry for this,\r\nfor Antanas was soon \xe2\x80\x9cGod-damning\xe2\x80\x9d everything and everybody.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when he was able to use his hands, Jurgis took his bedding\r\nagain and went back to his task of shifting rails. It was now April,\r\nand the snow had given place to cold rains, and the unpaved street in\r\nfront of Aniele\xe2\x80\x99s house was turned into a canal. Jurgis would have to\r\nwade through it to get home, and if it was late he might easily get\r\nstuck to his waist in the mire. But he did not mind this much\xe2\x80\x94it was a\r\npromise that summer was coming. Marija had now gotten a place as\r\nbeef-trimmer in one of the smaller packing plants; and he told himself\r\nthat he had learned his lesson now, and would meet with no more\r\naccidents\xe2\x80\x94so that at last there was prospect of an end to their long\r\nagony. They could save money again, and when another winter came they\r\nwould have a comfortable place; and the children would be off the\r\nstreets and in school again, and they might set to work to nurse back\r\ninto life their habits of decency and kindness. So once more Jurgis\r\nbegan to make plans and dream dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd then one Saturday night he jumped off the car and started home,\r\nwith the sun shining low under the edge of a bank of clouds that had\r\nbeen pouring floods of water into the mud-soaked street. There was a\r\nrainbow in the sky, and another in his breast\xe2\x80\x94for he had thirty-six\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 rest before him, and a chance to see his family. Then suddenly\r\nhe came in sight of the house, and noticed that there was a crowd\r\nbefore the door. He ran up the steps and pushed his way in, and saw\r\nAniele\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen crowded with excited women. It reminded him so vividly\r\nof the time when he had come home from jail and found Ona dying, that\r\nhis heart almost stood still. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nA dead silence had fallen in the room, and he saw that every one was\r\nstaring at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed again.\r\n\r\nAnd then, up in the garret, he heard sounds of wailing, in Marija\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice. He started for the ladder\xe2\x80\x94and Aniele seized him by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nno!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go up there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n\r\nAnd the old woman answered him weakly: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Antanas. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead. He was\r\ndrowned out in the street!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis took the news in a peculiar way. He turned deadly pale, but he\r\ncaught himself, and for half a minute stood in the middle of the room,\r\nclenching his hands tightly and setting his teeth. Then he pushed\r\nAniele aside and strode into the next room and climbed the ladder.\r\n\r\nIn the corner was a blanket, with a form half showing beneath it; and\r\nbeside it lay Elzbieta, whether crying or in a faint, Jurgis could not\r\ntell. Marija was pacing the room, screaming and wringing her hands. He\r\nclenched his hands tighter yet, and his voice was hard as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMarija scarcely heard him in her agony. He repeated the question,\r\nlouder and yet more harshly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe fell off the sidewalk!\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed.\r\nThe sidewalk in front of the house was a platform made of half-rotten\r\nboards, about five feet above the level of the sunken street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did he come to be there?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went\xe2\x80\x94he went out to play,\xe2\x80\x9d Marija sobbed, her voice choking her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make him stay in. He must have got caught in the mud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that he is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAi! ai!\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; we had the doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Jurgis stood a few seconds, wavering. He did not shed a tear. He\r\ntook one glance more at the blanket with the little form beneath it,\r\nand then turned suddenly to the ladder and climbed down again. A\r\nsilence fell once more in the room as he entered. He went straight to\r\nthe door, passed out, and started down the street.\r\n\r\nWhen his wife had died, Jurgis made for the nearest saloon, but he did\r\nnot do that now, though he had his week\xe2\x80\x99s wages in his pocket. He\r\nwalked and walked, seeing nothing, splashing through mud and water.\r\nLater on he sat down upon a step and hid his face in his hands and for\r\nhalf an hour or so he did not move. Now and then he would whisper to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cDead! _Dead!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinally, he got up and walked on again. It was about sunset, and he\r\nwent on and on until it was dark, when he was stopped by a railroad\r\ncrossing. The gates were down, and a long train of freight cars was\r\nthundering by. He stood and watched it; and all at once a wild impulse\r\nseized him, a thought that had been lurking within him, unspoken,\r\nunrecognized, leaped into sudden life. He started down the track, and\r\nwhen he was past the gate-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s shanty he sprang forward and swung\r\nhimself on to one of the cars.\r\n\r\nBy and by the train stopped again, and Jurgis sprang down and ran under\r\nthe car, and hid himself upon the truck. Here he sat, and when the\r\ntrain started again, he fought a battle with his soul. He gripped his\r\nhands and set his teeth together\xe2\x80\x94he had not wept, and he would not\xe2\x80\x94not\r\na tear! It was past and over, and he was done with it\xe2\x80\x94he would fling it\r\noff his shoulders, be free of it, the whole business, that night. It\r\nshould go like a black, hateful nightmare, and in the morning he would\r\nbe a new man. And every time that a thought of it assailed him\xe2\x80\x94a tender\r\nmemory, a trace of a tear\xe2\x80\x94he rose up, cursing with rage, and pounded it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nHe was fighting for his life; he gnashed his teeth together in his\r\ndesperation. He had been a fool, a fool! He had wasted his life, he had\r\nwrecked himself, with his accursed weakness; and now he was done with\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94he would tear it out of him, root and branch! There should be no\r\nmore tears and no more tenderness; he had had enough of them\xe2\x80\x94they had\r\nsold him into slavery! Now he was going to be free, to tear off his\r\nshackles, to rise up and fight. He was glad that the end had come\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nhad to come some time, and it was just as well now. This was no world\r\nfor women and children, and the sooner they got out of it the better\r\nfor them. Whatever Antanas might suffer where he was, he could suffer\r\nno more than he would have had he stayed upon earth. And meantime his\r\nfather had thought the last thought about him that he meant to; he was\r\ngoing to think of himself, he was going to fight for himself, against\r\nthe world that had baffled him and tortured him!\r\n\r\nSo he went on, tearing up all the flowers from the garden of his soul,\r\nand setting his heel upon them. The train thundered deafeningly, and a\r\nstorm of dust blew in his face; but though it stopped now and then\r\nthrough the night, he clung where he was\xe2\x80\x94he would cling there until he\r\nwas driven off, for every mile that he got from Packingtown meant\r\nanother load from his mind.\r\n\r\nWhenever the cars stopped a warm breeze blew upon him, a breeze laden\r\nwith the perfume of fresh fields, of honeysuckle and clover. He snuffed\r\nit, and it made his heart beat wildly\xe2\x80\x94he was out in the country again!\r\nHe was going to _live_ in the country! When the dawn came he was\r\npeering out with hungry eyes, getting glimpses of meadows and woods and\r\nrivers. At last he could stand it no longer, and when the train stopped\r\nagain he crawled out. Upon the top of the car was a brakeman, who shook\r\nhis fist and swore; Jurgis waved his hand derisively, and started\r\nacross the country.\r\n\r\nOnly think that he had been a countryman all his life; and for three\r\nlong years he had never seen a country sight nor heard a country sound!\r\nExcepting for that one walk when he left jail, when he was too much\r\nworried to notice anything, and for a few times that he had rested in\r\nthe city parks in the winter time when he was out of work, he had\r\nliterally never seen a tree! And now he felt like a bird lifted up and\r\nborne away upon a gale; he stopped and stared at each new sight of\r\nwonder\xe2\x80\x94at a herd of cows, and a meadow full of daisies, at hedgerows\r\nset thick with June roses, at little birds singing in the trees.\r\n\r\nThen he came to a farm-house, and after getting himself a stick for\r\nprotection, he approached it. The farmer was greasing a wagon in front\r\nof the barn, and Jurgis went to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to get some\r\nbreakfast, please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to work?\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can\xe2\x80\x99t get anything here,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant to pay for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer; and then added sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t serve\r\nbreakfast after 7 A.M.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to buy some\r\nfood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer, nodding over his shoulder. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x9d was more tractable, and for a dime Jurgis secured two thick\r\nsandwiches and a piece of pie and two apples. He walked off eating the\r\npie, as the least convenient thing to carry. In a few minutes he came\r\nto a stream, and he climbed a fence and walked down the bank, along a\r\nwoodland path. By and by he found a comfortable spot, and there he\r\ndevoured his meal, slaking his thirst at the stream. Then he lay for\r\nhours, just gazing and drinking in joy; until at last he felt sleepy,\r\nand lay down in the shade of a bush.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the sun was shining hot in his face. He sat up and\r\nstretched his arms, and then gazed at the water sliding by. There was a\r\ndeep pool, sheltered and silent, below him, and a sudden wonderful idea\r\nrushed upon him. He might have a bath! The water was free, and he might\r\nget into it\xe2\x80\x94all the way into it! It would be the first time that he had\r\nbeen all the way into the water since he left Lithuania!\r\n\r\nWhen Jurgis had first come to the stockyards he had been as clean as\r\nany workingman could well be. But later on, what with sickness and cold\r\nand hunger and discouragement, and the filthiness of his work, and the\r\nvermin in his home, he had given up washing in winter, and in summer\r\nonly as much of him as would go into a basin. He had had a shower bath\r\nin jail, but nothing since\xe2\x80\x94and now he would have a swim!\r\n\r\nThe water was warm, and he splashed about like a very boy in his glee.\r\nAfterward he sat down in the water near the bank, and proceeded to\r\nscrub himself\xe2\x80\x94soberly and methodically, scouring every inch of him with\r\nsand. While he was doing it he would do it thoroughly, and see how it\r\nfelt to be clean. He even scrubbed his head with sand, and combed what\r\nthe men called \xe2\x80\x9ccrumbs\xe2\x80\x9d out of his long, black hair, holding his head\r\nunder water as long as he could, to see if he could not kill them all.\r\nThen, seeing that the sun was still hot, he took his clothes from the\r\nbank and proceeded to wash them, piece by piece; as the dirt and grease\r\nwent floating off downstream he grunted with satisfaction and soused\r\nthe clothes again, venturing even to dream that he might get rid of the\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nHe hung them all up, and while they were drying he lay down in the sun\r\nand had another long sleep. They were hot and stiff as boards on top,\r\nand a little damp on the underside, when he awakened; but being hungry,\r\nhe put them on and set out again. He had no knife, but with some labor\r\nhe broke himself a good stout club, and, armed with this, he marched\r\ndown the road again.\r\n\r\nBefore long he came to a big farmhouse, and turned up the lane that led\r\nto it. It was just supper-time, and the farmer was washing his hands at\r\nthe kitchen door. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9ccan I have something to\r\neat? I can pay.\xe2\x80\x9d To which the farmer responded promptly, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t feed\r\ntramps here. Get out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis went without a word; but as he passed round the barn he came to\r\na freshly ploughed and harrowed field, in which the farmer had set out\r\nsome young peach trees; and as he walked he jerked up a row of them by\r\nthe roots, more than a hundred trees in all, before he reached the end\r\nof the field. That was his answer, and it showed his mood; from now on\r\nhe was fighting, and the man who hit him would get all that he gave,\r\nevery time.\r\n\r\nBeyond the orchard Jurgis struck through a patch of woods, and then a\r\nfield of winter grain, and came at last to another road. Before long he\r\nsaw another farmhouse, and, as it was beginning to cloud over a little,\r\nhe asked here for shelter as well as food. Seeing the farmer eying him\r\ndubiously, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to sleep in the barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it out of doors.\xe2\x80\x9d When the man\r\nhad assented, he inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cHow much will it cost me? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\nmuch money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon about twenty cents for supper,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the farmer. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncharge ye for the barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went in, and sat down at the table with the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife and\r\nhalf a dozen children. It was a bountiful meal\xe2\x80\x94there were baked beans\r\nand mashed potatoes and asparagus chopped and stewed, and a dish of\r\nstrawberries, and great, thick slices of bread, and a pitcher of milk.\r\nJurgis had not had such a feast since his wedding day, and he made a\r\nmighty effort to put in his twenty cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth.\r\n\r\nThey were all of them too hungry to talk; but afterward they sat upon\r\nthe steps and smoked, and the farmer questioned his guest. When Jurgis\r\nhad explained that he was a workingman from Chicago, and that he did\r\nnot know just whither he was bound, the other said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay\r\nhere and work for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not looking for work just now,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay ye good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, eying his big form\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca dollar a day\r\nand board ye. Help\xe2\x80\x99s terrible scarce round here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that winter as well as summer?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis demanded quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer; \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep ye after November\xe2\x80\x94I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\na big enough place for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought. When you get through\r\nworking your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Jurgis was beginning to think for himself nowadays.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t quite the same,\xe2\x80\x9d the farmer answered, seeing the point.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ought to be work a strong fellow like you can find to do, in the\r\ncities, or some place, in the winter time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what they all think; and so they crowd into\r\nthe cities, and when they have to beg or steal to live, then people ask\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em why they don\xe2\x80\x99t go into the country, where help is scarce.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfarmer meditated awhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about when your money\xe2\x80\x99s gone?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, finally. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nto, then, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till she\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis; \xe2\x80\x9cthen I\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a long sleep in the barn and then a big breakfast of coffee and\r\nbread and oatmeal and stewed cherries, for which the man charged him\r\nonly fifteen cents, perhaps having been influenced by his arguments.\r\nThen Jurgis bade farewell, and went on his way.\r\n\r\nSuch was the beginning of his life as a tramp. It was seldom he got as\r\nfair treatment as from this last farmer, and so as time went on he\r\nlearned to shun the houses and to prefer sleeping in the fields. When\r\nit rained he would find a deserted building, if he could, and if not,\r\nhe would wait until after dark and then, with his stick ready, begin a\r\nstealthy approach upon a barn. Generally he could get in before the dog\r\ngot scent of him, and then he would hide in the hay and be safe until\r\nmorning; if not, and the dog attacked him, he would rise up and make a\r\nretreat in battle order. Jurgis was not the mighty man he had once\r\nbeen, but his arms were still good, and there were few farm dogs he\r\nneeded to hit more than once.\r\n\r\nBefore long there came raspberries, and then blackberries, to help him\r\nsave his money; and there were apples in the orchards and potatoes in\r\nthe ground\xe2\x80\x94he learned to note the places and fill his pockets after\r\ndark. Twice he even managed to capture a chicken, and had a feast, once\r\nin a deserted barn and the other time in a lonely spot alongside of a\r\nstream. When all of these things failed him he used his money\r\ncarefully, but without worry\xe2\x80\x94for he saw that he could earn more\r\nwhenever he chose. Half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s chopping wood in his lively fashion\r\nwas enough to bring him a meal, and when the farmer had seen him\r\nworking he would sometimes try to bribe him to stay.\r\n\r\nBut Jurgis was not staying. He was a free man now, a buccaneer. The old\r\n_Wanderlust_ had got into his blood, the joy of the unbound life, the\r\njoy of seeking, of hoping without limit. There were mishaps and\r\ndiscomforts\xe2\x80\x94but at least there was always something new; and only think\r\nwhat it meant to a man who for years had been penned up in one place,\r\nseeing nothing but one dreary prospect of shanties and factories, to be\r\nsuddenly set loose beneath the open sky, to behold new landscapes, new\r\nplaces, and new people every hour! To a man whose whole life had\r\nconsisted of doing one certain thing all day, until he was so exhausted\r\nthat he could only lie down and sleep until the next day\xe2\x80\x94and to be now\r\nhis own master, working as he pleased and when he pleased, and facing a\r\nnew adventure every hour!\r\n\r\nThen, too, his health came back to him, all his lost youthful vigor,\r\nhis joy and power that he had mourned and forgotten! It came with a\r\nsudden rush, bewildering him, startling him; it was as if his dead\r\nchildhood had come back to him, laughing and calling! What with plenty\r\nto eat and fresh air and exercise that was taken as it pleased him, he\r\nwould waken from his sleep and start off not knowing what to do with\r\nhis energy, stretching his arms, laughing, singing old songs of home\r\nthat came back to him. Now and then, of course, he could not help but\r\nthink of little Antanas, whom he should never see again, whose little\r\nvoice he should never hear; and then he would have to battle with\r\nhimself. Sometimes at night he would waken dreaming of Ona, and stretch\r\nout his arms to her, and wet the ground with his tears. But in the\r\nmorning he would get up and shake himself, and stride away again to\r\nbattle with the world.\r\n\r\nHe never asked where he was nor where he was going; the country was big\r\nenough, he knew, and there was no danger of his coming to the end of\r\nit. And of course he could always have company for the\r\nasking\xe2\x80\x94everywhere he went there were men living just as he lived, and\r\nwhom he was welcome to join. He was a stranger at the business, but\r\nthey were not clannish, and they taught him all their tricks\xe2\x80\x94what towns\r\nand villages it was best to keep away from, and how to read the secret\r\nsigns upon the fences, and when to beg and when to steal, and just how\r\nto do both. They laughed at his ideas of paying for anything with money\r\nor with work\xe2\x80\x94for they got all they wanted without either. Now and then\r\nJurgis camped out with a gang of them in some woodland haunt, and\r\nforaged with them in the neighborhood at night. And then among them\r\nsome one would \xe2\x80\x9ctake a shine\xe2\x80\x9d to him, and they would go off together\r\nand travel for a week, exchanging reminiscences.\r\n\r\nOf these professional tramps a great many had, of course, been\r\nshiftless and vicious all their lives. But the vast majority of them\r\nhad been workingmen, had fought the long fight as Jurgis had, and found\r\nthat it was a losing fight, and given up. Later on he encountered yet\r\nanother sort of men, those from whose ranks the tramps were recruited,\r\nmen who were homeless and wandering, but still seeking work\xe2\x80\x94seeking it\r\nin the harvest fields. Of these there was an army, the huge surplus\r\nlabor army of society; called into being under the stern system of\r\nnature, to do the casual work of the world, the tasks which were\r\ntransient and irregular, and yet which had to be done. They did not\r\nknow that they were such, of course; they only knew that they sought\r\nthe job, and that the job was fleeting. In the early summer they would\r\nbe in Texas, and as the crops were ready they would follow north with\r\nthe season, ending with the fall in Manitoba. Then they would seek out\r\nthe big lumber camps, where there was winter work; or failing in this,\r\nwould drift to the cities, and live upon what they had managed to save,\r\nwith the help of such transient work as was there the loading and\r\nunloading of steamships and drays, the digging of ditches and the\r\nshoveling of snow. If there were more of them on hand than chanced to\r\nbe needed, the weaker ones died off of cold and hunger, again according\r\nto the stern system of nature.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter part of July, when Jurgis was in Missouri, that he\r\ncame upon the harvest work. Here were crops that men had worked for\r\nthree or four months to prepare, and of which they would lose nearly\r\nall unless they could find others to help them for a week or two. So\r\nall over the land there was a cry for labor\xe2\x80\x94agencies were set up and\r\nall the cities were drained of men, even college boys were brought by\r\nthe carload, and hordes of frantic farmers would hold up trains and\r\ncarry off wagon-loads of men by main force. Not that they did not pay\r\nthem well\xe2\x80\x94any man could get two dollars a day and his board, and the\r\nbest men could get two dollars and a half or three.\r\n\r\nThe harvest-fever was in the very air, and no man with any spirit in\r\nhim could be in that region and not catch it. Jurgis joined a gang and\r\nworked from dawn till dark, eighteen hours a day, for two weeks without\r\na break. Then he had a sum of money that would have been a fortune to\r\nhim in the old days of misery\xe2\x80\x94but what could he do with it now? To be\r\nsure he might have put it in a bank, and, if he were fortunate, get it\r\nback again when he wanted it. But Jurgis was now a homeless man,\r\nwandering over a continent; and what did he know about banking and\r\ndrafts and letters of credit? If he carried the money about with him,\r\nhe would surely be robbed in the end; and so what was there for him to\r\ndo but enjoy it while he could? On a Saturday night he drifted into a\r\ntown with his fellows; and because it was raining, and there was no\r\nother place provided for him, he went to a saloon. And there were some\r\nwho treated him and whom he had to treat, and there was laughter and\r\nsinging and good cheer; and then out of the rear part of the saloon a\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s face, red-cheeked and merry, smiled at Jurgis, and his heart\r\nthumped suddenly in his throat. He nodded to her, and she came and sat\r\nby him, and they had more drink, and then he went upstairs into a room\r\nwith her, and the wild beast rose up within him and screamed, as it has\r\nscreamed in the Jungle from the dawn of time. And then because of his\r\nmemories and his shame, he was glad when others joined them, men and\r\nwomen; and they had more drink and spent the night in wild rioting and\r\ndebauchery. In the van of the surplus-labor army, there followed\r\nanother, an army of women, they also struggling for life under the\r\nstern system of nature. Because there were rich men who sought\r\npleasure, there had been ease and plenty for them so long as they were\r\nyoung and beautiful; and later on, when they were crowded out by others\r\nyounger and more beautiful, they went out to follow upon the trail of\r\nthe workingmen. Sometimes they came of themselves, and the\r\nsaloon-keepers shared with them; or sometimes they were handled by\r\nagencies, the same as the labor army. They were in the towns in harvest\r\ntime, near the lumber camps in the winter, in the cities when the men\r\ncame there; if a regiment were encamped, or a railroad or canal being\r\nmade, or a great exposition getting ready, the crowd of women were on\r\nhand, living in shanties or saloons or tenement rooms, sometimes eight\r\nor ten of them together.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Jurgis had not a cent, and he went out upon the road\r\nagain. He was sick and disgusted, but after the new plan of his life,\r\nhe crushed his feelings down. He had made a fool of himself, but he\r\ncould not help it now\xe2\x80\x94all he could do was to see that it did not happen\r\nagain. So he tramped on until exercise and fresh air banished his\r\nheadache, and his strength and joy returned. This happened to him every\r\ntime, for Jurgis was still a creature of impulse, and his pleasures had\r\nnot yet become business. It would be a long time before he could be\r\nlike the majority of these men of the road, who roamed until the hunger\r\nfor drink and for women mastered them, and then went to work with a\r\npurpose in mind, and stopped when they had the price of a spree.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, try as he would, Jurgis could not help being made\r\nmiserable by his conscience. It was the ghost that would not down. It\r\nwould come upon him in the most unexpected places\xe2\x80\x94sometimes it fairly\r\ndrove him to drink.\r\n\r\nOne night he was caught by a thunderstorm, and he sought shelter in a\r\nlittle house just outside of a town. It was a working-man\xe2\x80\x99s home, and\r\nthe owner was a Slav like himself, a new emigrant from White Russia; he\r\nbade Jurgis welcome in his home language, and told him to come to the\r\nkitchen-fire and dry himself. He had no bed for him, but there was\r\nstraw in the garret, and he could make out. The man\xe2\x80\x99s wife was cooking\r\nthe supper, and their children were playing about on the floor. Jurgis\r\nsat and exchanged thoughts with him about the old country, and the\r\nplaces where they had been and the work they had done. Then they ate,\r\nand afterward sat and smoked and talked more about America, and how\r\nthey found it. In the middle of a sentence, however, Jurgis stopped,\r\nseeing that the woman had brought a big basin of water and was\r\nproceeding to undress her youngest baby. The rest had crawled into the\r\ncloset where they slept, but the baby was to have a bath, the\r\nworkingman explained. The nights had begun to be chilly, and his\r\nmother, ignorant as to the climate in America, had sewed him up for the\r\nwinter; then it had turned warm again, and some kind of a rash had\r\nbroken out on the child. The doctor had said she must bathe him every\r\nnight, and she, foolish woman, believed him.\r\n\r\nJurgis scarcely heard the explanation; he was watching the baby. He was\r\nabout a year old, and a sturdy little fellow, with soft fat legs, and a\r\nround ball of a stomach, and eyes as black as coals. His pimples did\r\nnot seem to bother him much, and he was wild with glee over the bath,\r\nkicking and squirming and chuckling with delight, pulling at his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s face and then at his own little toes. When she put him into\r\nthe basin he sat in the midst of it and grinned, splashing the water\r\nover himself and squealing like a little pig. He spoke in Russian, of\r\nwhich Jurgis knew some; he spoke it with the quaintest of baby\r\naccents\xe2\x80\x94and every word of it brought back to Jurgis some word of his\r\nown dead little one, and stabbed him like a knife. He sat perfectly\r\nmotionless, silent, but gripping his hands tightly, while a storm\r\ngathered in his bosom and a flood heaped itself up behind his eyes. And\r\nin the end he could bear it no more, but buried his face in his hands\r\nand burst into tears, to the alarm and amazement of his hosts. Between\r\nthe shame of this and his woe Jurgis could not stand it, and got up and\r\nrushed out into the rain.\r\n\r\nHe went on and on down the road, finally coming to a black woods, where\r\nhe hid and wept as if his heart would break. Ah, what agony was that,\r\nwhat despair, when the tomb of memory was rent open and the ghosts of\r\nhis old life came forth to scourge him! What terror to see what he had\r\nbeen and now could never be\xe2\x80\x94to see Ona and his child and his own dead\r\nself stretching out their arms to him, calling to him across a\r\nbottomless abyss\xe2\x80\x94and to know that they were gone from him forever, and\r\nhe writhing and suffocating in the mire of his own vileness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the fall Jurgis set out for Chicago again. All the joy went\r\nout of tramping as soon as a man could not keep warm in the hay; and,\r\nlike many thousands of others, he deluded himself with the hope that by\r\ncoming early he could avoid the rush. He brought fifteen dollars with\r\nhim, hidden away in one of his shoes, a sum which had been saved from\r\nthe saloon-keepers, not so much by his conscience, as by the fear which\r\nfilled him at the thought of being out of work in the city in the\r\nwinter time.\r\n\r\nHe traveled upon the railroad with several other men, hiding in freight\r\ncars at night, and liable to be thrown off at any time, regardless of\r\nthe speed of the train. When he reached the city he left the rest, for\r\nhe had money and they did not, and he meant to save himself in this\r\nfight. He would bring to it all the skill that practice had brought\r\nhim, and he would stand, whoever fell. On fair nights he would sleep in\r\nthe park or on a truck or an empty barrel or box, and when it was rainy\r\nor cold he would stow himself upon a shelf in a ten-cent lodging-house,\r\nor pay three cents for the privileges of a \xe2\x80\x9csquatter\xe2\x80\x9d in a tenement\r\nhallway. He would eat at free lunches, five cents a meal, and never a\r\ncent more\xe2\x80\x94so he might keep alive for two months and more, and in that\r\ntime he would surely find a job. He would have to bid farewell to his\r\nsummer cleanliness, of course, for he would come out of the first\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s lodging with his clothes alive with vermin. There was no place\r\nin the city where he could wash even his face, unless he went down to\r\nthe lake front\xe2\x80\x94and there it would soon be all ice.\r\n\r\nFirst he went to the steel mill and the harvester works, and found that\r\nhis places there had been filled long ago. He was careful to keep away\r\nfrom the stockyards\xe2\x80\x94he was a single man now, he told himself, and he\r\nmeant to stay one, to have his wages for his own when he got a job. He\r\nbegan the long, weary round of factories and warehouses, tramping all\r\nday, from one end of the city to the other, finding everywhere from ten\r\nto a hundred men ahead of him. He watched the newspapers, too\xe2\x80\x94but no\r\nlonger was he to be taken in by smooth-spoken agents. He had been told\r\nof all those tricks while \xe2\x80\x9con the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end it was through a newspaper that he got a job, after nearly a\r\nmonth of seeking. It was a call for a hundred laborers, and though he\r\nthought it was a \xe2\x80\x9cfake,\xe2\x80\x9d he went because the place was near by. He\r\nfound a line of men a block long, but as a wagon chanced to come out of\r\nan alley and break the line, he saw his chance and sprang to seize a\r\nplace. Men threatened him and tried to throw him out, but he cursed and\r\nmade a disturbance to attract a policeman, upon which they subsided,\r\nknowing that if the latter interfered it would be to \xe2\x80\x9cfire\xe2\x80\x9d them all.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two later he entered a room and confronted a big Irishman\r\nbehind a desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver worked in Chicago before?\xe2\x80\x9d the man inquired; and whether it was a\r\ngood angel that put it into Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s mind, or an intuition of his\r\nsharpened wits, he was moved to answer, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKansas City, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny references?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m just an unskilled man. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got good arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want men for hard work\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all underground, digging tunnels for\r\ntelephones. Maybe it won\xe2\x80\x99t suit you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willing, sir\xe2\x80\x94anything for me. What\xe2\x80\x99s the pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen cents an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; go back there and give your name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo within half an hour he was at work, far underneath the streets of\r\nthe city. The tunnel was a peculiar one for telephone wires; it was\r\nabout eight feet high, and with a level floor nearly as wide. It had\r\ninnumerable branches\xe2\x80\x94a perfect spider web beneath the city; Jurgis\r\nwalked over half a mile with his gang to the place where they were to\r\nwork. Stranger yet, the tunnel was lighted by electricity, and upon it\r\nwas laid a double-tracked, narrow-gauge railroad!\r\n\r\nBut Jurgis was not there to ask questions, and he did not give the\r\nmatter a thought. It was nearly a year afterward that he finally\r\nlearned the meaning of this whole affair. The City Council had passed a\r\nquiet and innocent little bill allowing a company to construct\r\ntelephone conduits under the city streets; and upon the strength of\r\nthis, a great corporation had proceeded to tunnel all Chicago with a\r\nsystem of railway freight-subways. In the city there was a combination\r\nof employers, representing hundreds of millions of capital, and formed\r\nfor the purpose of crushing the labor unions. The chief union which\r\ntroubled it was the teamsters\xe2\x80\x99; and when these freight tunnels were\r\ncompleted, connecting all the big factories and stores with the\r\nrailroad depots, they would have the teamsters\xe2\x80\x99 union by the throat.\r\nNow and then there were rumors and murmurs in the Board of Aldermen,\r\nand once there was a committee to investigate\xe2\x80\x94but each time another\r\nsmall fortune was paid over, and the rumors died away; until at last\r\nthe city woke up with a start to find the work completed. There was a\r\ntremendous scandal, of course; it was found that the city records had\r\nbeen falsified and other crimes committed, and some of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s big\r\ncapitalists got into jail\xe2\x80\x94figuratively speaking. The aldermen declared\r\nthat they had had no idea of it all, in spite of the fact that the main\r\nentrance to the work had been in the rear of the saloon of one of them.\r\n\r\nIt was in a newly opened cut that Jurgis worked, and so he knew that he\r\nhad an all-winter job. He was so rejoiced that he treated himself to a\r\nspree that night, and with the balance of his money he hired himself a\r\nplace in a tenement room, where he slept upon a big homemade straw\r\nmattress along with four other workingmen. This was one dollar a week,\r\nand for four more he got his food in a boardinghouse near his work.\r\nThis would leave him four dollars extra each week, an unthinkable sum\r\nfor him. At the outset he had to pay for his digging tools, and also to\r\nbuy a pair of heavy boots, since his shoes were falling to pieces, and\r\na flannel shirt, since the one he had worn all summer was in shreds. He\r\nspent a week meditating whether or not he should also buy an overcoat.\r\nThere was one belonging to a Hebrew collar button peddler, who had died\r\nin the room next to him, and which the landlady was holding for her\r\nrent; in the end, however, Jurgis decided to do without it, as he was\r\nto be underground by day and in bed at night.\r\n\r\nThis was an unfortunate decision, however, for it drove him more\r\nquickly than ever into the saloons. From now on Jurgis worked from\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock until half-past five, with half an hour for dinner; which\r\nmeant that he never saw the sunlight on weekdays. In the evenings there\r\nwas no place for him to go except a barroom; no place where there was\r\nlight and warmth, where he could hear a little music or sit with a\r\ncompanion and talk. He had now no home to go to; he had no affection\r\nleft in his life\xe2\x80\x94only the pitiful mockery of it in the _camaraderie_ of\r\nvice. On Sundays the churches were open\xe2\x80\x94but where was there a church in\r\nwhich an ill-smelling workingman, with vermin crawling upon his neck,\r\ncould sit without seeing people edge away and look annoyed? He had, of\r\ncourse, his corner in a close though unheated room, with a window\r\nopening upon a blank wall two feet away; and also he had the bare\r\nstreets, with the winter gales sweeping through them; besides this he\r\nhad only the saloons\xe2\x80\x94and, of course, he had to drink to stay in them.\r\nIf he drank now and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble\r\nwith dice or a pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for\r\nmoney, or to look at a beer-stained pink \xe2\x80\x9csporting paper,\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\npictures of murderers and half-naked women. It was for such pleasures\r\nas these that he spent his money; and such was his life during the six\r\nweeks and a half that he toiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable\r\nthem to break the grip of their teamsters\xe2\x80\x99 union.\r\n\r\nIn a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare\r\nof the laborers. On an average, the tunneling cost a life a day and\r\nseveral manglings; it was seldom, however, that more than a dozen or\r\ntwo men heard of any one accident. The work was all done by the new\r\nboring machinery, with as little blasting as possible; but there would\r\nbe falling rocks and crushed supports, and premature explosions\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\naddition all the dangers of railroading. So it was that one night, as\r\nJurgis was on his way out with his gang, an engine and a loaded car\r\ndashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him\r\nupon the shoulder, hurling him against the concrete wall and knocking\r\nhim senseless.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of an\r\nambulance. He was lying in it, covered by a blanket, and it was\r\nthreading its way slowly through the holiday-shopping crowds. They took\r\nhim to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his arm; then he\r\nwas washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of\r\nmaimed and mangled men.\r\n\r\nJurgis spent his Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest\r\nChristmas he had had in America. Every year there were scandals and\r\ninvestigations in this institution, the newspapers charging that\r\ndoctors were allowed to try fantastic experiments upon the patients;\r\nbut Jurgis knew nothing of this\xe2\x80\x94his only complaint was that they used\r\nto feed him upon tinned meat, which no man who had ever worked in\r\nPackingtown would feed to his dog. Jurgis had often wondered just who\r\nate the canned corned beef and \xe2\x80\x9croast beef\xe2\x80\x9d of the stockyards; now he\r\nbegan to understand\xe2\x80\x94that it was what you might call \xe2\x80\x9cgraft meat,\xe2\x80\x9d put\r\nup to be sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by\r\nsoldiers and sailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshantymen\xe2\x80\x9d and gangs of railroad laborers.\r\n\r\nJurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks. This\r\ndid not mean that his arm was strong and that he was able to go back to\r\nwork, but simply that he could get along without further attention, and\r\nthat his place was needed for some one worse off than he. That he was\r\nutterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the\r\nmeantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities,\r\nnor any one else in the city.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced, he had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his\r\nlast week\xe2\x80\x99s board and his room rent, and spent nearly all the balance\r\nof his Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s pay. He had less than seventy-five cents in his\r\npockets, and a dollar and a half due him for the day\xe2\x80\x99s work he had done\r\nbefore he was hurt. He might possibly have sued the company, and got\r\nsome damages for his injuries, but he did not know this, and it was not\r\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s business to tell him. He went and got his pay and his\r\ntools, which he left in a pawnshop for fifty cents. Then he went to his\r\nlandlady, who had rented his place and had no other for him; and then\r\nto his boardinghouse keeper, who looked him over and questioned him. As\r\nhe must certainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded\r\nthere only six weeks, she decided very quickly that it would not be\r\nworth the risk to keep him on trust.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight. It was\r\nbitterly cold, and a heavy snow was falling, beating into his face. He\r\nhad no overcoat, and no place to go, and two dollars and sixty-five\r\ncents in his pocket, with the certainty that he could not earn another\r\ncent for months. The snow meant no chance to him now; he must walk\r\nalong and see others shoveling, vigorous and active\xe2\x80\x94and he with his\r\nleft arm bound to his side! He could not hope to tide himself over by\r\nodd jobs of loading trucks; he could not even sell newspapers or carry\r\nsatchels, because he was now at the mercy of any rival. Words could not\r\npaint the terror that came over him as he realized all this. He was\r\nlike a wounded animal in the forest; he was forced to compete with his\r\nenemies upon unequal terms. There would be no consideration for him\r\nbecause of his weakness\xe2\x80\x94it was no one\xe2\x80\x99s business to help him in such\r\ndistress, to make the fight the least bit easier for him. Even if he\r\ntook to begging, he would be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he\r\nwas to discover in good time.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning he could not think of anything except getting out of\r\nthe awful cold. He went into one of the saloons he had been wont to\r\nfrequent and bought a drink, and then stood by the fire shivering and\r\nwaiting to be ordered out. According to an unwritten law, the buying a\r\ndrink included the privilege of loafing for just so long; then one had\r\nto buy another drink or move on. That Jurgis was an old customer\r\nentitled him to a somewhat longer stop; but then he had been away two\r\nweeks, and was evidently \xe2\x80\x9con the bum.\xe2\x80\x9d He might plead and tell his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chard luck story,\xe2\x80\x9d but that would not help him much; a saloon-keeper\r\nwho was to be moved by such means would soon have his place jammed to\r\nthe doors with \xe2\x80\x9choboes\xe2\x80\x9d on a day like this.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went out into another place, and paid another nickel. He was\r\nso hungry this time that he could not resist the hot beef stew, an\r\nindulgence which cut short his stay by a considerable time. When he was\r\nagain told to move on, he made his way to a \xe2\x80\x9ctough\xe2\x80\x9d place in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cL\xc3\xaav\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x9d district, where now and then he had gone with a certain\r\nrat-eyed Bohemian workingman of his acquaintance, seeking a woman. It\r\nwas Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s vain hope that here the proprietor would let him remain as\r\na \xe2\x80\x9csitter.\xe2\x80\x9d In low-class places, in the dead of winter, saloon-keepers\r\nwould often allow one or two forlorn-looking bums who came in covered\r\nwith snow or soaked with rain to sit by the fire and look miserable to\r\nattract custom. A workingman would come in, feeling cheerful after his\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work was over, and it would trouble him to have to take his glass\r\nwith such a sight under his nose; and so he would call out: \xe2\x80\x9cHello,\r\nBub, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? You look as if you\xe2\x80\x99d been up against it!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen the other would begin to pour out some tale of misery, and the man\r\nwould say, \xe2\x80\x9cCome have a glass, and maybe that\xe2\x80\x99ll brace you up.\xe2\x80\x9d And so\r\nthey would drink together, and if the tramp was sufficiently\r\nwretched-looking, or good enough at the \xe2\x80\x9cgab,\xe2\x80\x9d they might have two; and\r\nif they were to discover that they were from the same country, or had\r\nlived in the same city or worked at the same trade, they might sit down\r\nat a table and spend an hour or two in talk\xe2\x80\x94and before they got through\r\nthe saloon-keeper would have taken in a dollar. All of this might seem\r\ndiabolical, but the saloon-keeper was in no wise to blame for it. He\r\nwas in the same plight as the manufacturer who has to adulterate and\r\nmisrepresent his product. If he does not, some one else will; and the\r\nsaloon-keeper, unless he is also an alderman, is apt to be in debt to\r\nthe big brewers, and on the verge of being sold out.\r\n\r\nThe market for \xe2\x80\x9csitters\xe2\x80\x9d was glutted that afternoon, however, and there\r\nwas no place for Jurgis. In all he had to spend six nickels in keeping\r\na shelter over him that frightful day, and then it was just dark, and\r\nthe station houses would not open until midnight! At the last place,\r\nhowever, there was a bartender who knew him and liked him, and let him\r\ndoze at one of the tables until the boss came back; and also, as he was\r\ngoing out, the man gave him a tip\xe2\x80\x94on the next block there was a\r\nreligious revival of some sort, with preaching and singing, and\r\nhundreds of hoboes would go there for the shelter and warmth.\r\n\r\nJurgis went straightway, and saw a sign hung out, saying that the door\r\nwould open at seven-thirty; then he walked, or half ran, a block, and\r\nhid awhile in a doorway and then ran again, and so on until the hour.\r\nAt the end he was all but frozen, and fought his way in with the rest\r\nof the throng (at the risk of having his arm broken again), and got\r\nclose to the big stove.\r\n\r\nBy eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock the place was so crowded that the speakers ought to\r\nhave been flattered; the aisles were filled halfway up, and at the door\r\nmen were packed tight enough to walk upon. There were three elderly\r\ngentlemen in black upon the platform, and a young lady who played the\r\npiano in front. First they sang a hymn, and then one of the three, a\r\ntall, smooth-shaven man, very thin, and wearing black spectacles, began\r\nan address. Jurgis heard smatterings of it, for the reason that terror\r\nkept him awake\xe2\x80\x94he knew that he snored abominably, and to have been put\r\nout just then would have been like a sentence of death to him.\r\n\r\nThe evangelist was preaching \xe2\x80\x9csin and redemption,\xe2\x80\x9d the infinite grace\r\nof God and His pardon for human frailty. He was very much in earnest,\r\nand he meant well, but Jurgis, as he listened, found his soul filled\r\nwith hatred. What did he know about sin and suffering\xe2\x80\x94with his smooth,\r\nblack coat and his neatly starched collar, his body warm, and his belly\r\nfull, and money in his pocket\xe2\x80\x94and lecturing men who were struggling for\r\ntheir lives, men at the death grapple with the demon powers of hunger\r\nand cold!\xe2\x80\x94This, of course, was unfair; but Jurgis felt that these men\r\nwere out of touch with the life they discussed, that they were unfitted\r\nto solve its problems; nay, they themselves were part of the\r\nproblem\xe2\x80\x94they were part of the order established that was crushing men\r\ndown and beating them! They were of the triumphant and insolent\r\npossessors; they had a hall, and a fire, and food and clothing and\r\nmoney, and so they might preach to hungry men, and the hungry men must\r\nbe humble and listen! They were trying to save their souls\xe2\x80\x94and who but\r\na fool could fail to see that all that was the matter with their souls\r\nwas that they had not been able to get a decent existence for their\r\nbodies?\r\n\r\nAt eleven the meeting closed, and the desolate audience filed out into\r\nthe snow, muttering curses upon the few traitors who had got repentance\r\nand gone up on the platform. It was yet an hour before the station\r\nhouse would open, and Jurgis had no overcoat\xe2\x80\x94and was weak from a long\r\nillness. During that hour he nearly perished. He was obliged to run\r\nhard to keep his blood moving at all\xe2\x80\x94and then he came back to the\r\nstation house and found a crowd blocking the street before the door!\r\nThis was in the month of January, 1904, when the country was on the\r\nverge of \xe2\x80\x9chard times,\xe2\x80\x9d and the newspapers were reporting the shutting\r\ndown of factories every day\xe2\x80\x94it was estimated that a million and a half\r\nmen were thrown out of work before the spring. So all the hiding places\r\nof the city were crowded, and before that station house door men fought\r\nand tore each other like savage beasts. When at last the place was\r\njammed and they shut the doors, half the crowd was still outside; and\r\nJurgis, with his helpless arm, was among them. There was no choice then\r\nbut to go to a lodging-house and spend another dime. It really broke\r\nhis heart to do this, at half-past twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after he had wasted\r\nthe night at the meeting and on the street. He would be turned out of\r\nthe lodging-house promptly at seven\xe2\x80\x94they had the shelves which served\r\nas bunks so contrived that they could be dropped, and any man who was\r\nslow about obeying orders could be tumbled to the floor.\r\n\r\nThis was one day, and the cold spell lasted for fourteen of them. At\r\nthe end of six days every cent of Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 money was gone; and then he\r\nwent out on the streets to beg for his life.\r\n\r\nHe would begin as soon as the business of the city was moving. He would\r\nsally forth from a saloon, and, after making sure there was no\r\npoliceman in sight, would approach every likely-looking person who\r\npassed him, telling his woeful story and pleading for a nickel or a\r\ndime. Then when he got one, he would dart round the corner and return\r\nto his base to get warm; and his victim, seeing him do this, would go\r\naway, vowing that he would never give a cent to a beggar again. The\r\nvictim never paused to ask where else Jurgis could have gone under the\r\ncircumstances\xe2\x80\x94where he, the victim, would have gone. At the saloon\r\nJurgis could not only get more food and better food than he could buy\r\nin any restaurant for the same money, but a drink in the bargain to\r\nwarm him up. Also he could find a comfortable seat by a fire, and could\r\nchat with a companion until he was as warm as toast. At the saloon,\r\ntoo, he felt at home. Part of the saloon-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s business was to offer\r\na home and refreshments to beggars in exchange for the proceeds of\r\ntheir foragings; and was there any one else in the whole city who would\r\ndo this\xe2\x80\x94would the victim have done it himself?\r\n\r\nPoor Jurgis might have been expected to make a successful beggar. He\r\nwas just out of the hospital, and desperately sick-looking, and with a\r\nhelpless arm; also he had no overcoat, and shivered pitifully. But,\r\nalas, it was again the case of the honest merchant, who finds that the\r\ngenuine and unadulterated article is driven to the wall by the artistic\r\ncounterfeit. Jurgis, as a beggar, was simply a blundering amateur in\r\ncompetition with organized and scientific professionalism. He was just\r\nout of the hospital\xe2\x80\x94but the story was worn threadbare, and how could he\r\nprove it? He had his arm in a sling\xe2\x80\x94and it was a device a regular\r\nbeggar\xe2\x80\x99s little boy would have scorned. He was pale and shivering\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthey were made up with cosmetics, and had studied the art of chattering\r\ntheir teeth. As to his being without an overcoat, among them you would\r\nmeet men you could swear had on nothing but a ragged linen duster and a\r\npair of cotton trousers\xe2\x80\x94so cleverly had they concealed the several\r\nsuits of all-wool underwear beneath. Many of these professional\r\nmendicants had comfortable homes, and families, and thousands of\r\ndollars in the bank; some of them had retired upon their earnings, and\r\ngone into the business of fitting out and doctoring others, or working\r\nchildren at the trade. There were some who had both their arms bound\r\ntightly to their sides, and padded stumps in their sleeves, and a sick\r\nchild hired to carry a cup for them. There were some who had no legs,\r\nand pushed themselves upon a wheeled platform\xe2\x80\x94some who had been favored\r\nwith blindness, and were led by pretty little dogs. Some less fortunate\r\nhad mutilated themselves or burned themselves, or had brought horrible\r\nsores upon themselves with chemicals; you might suddenly encounter upon\r\nthe street a man holding out to you a finger rotting and discolored\r\nwith gangrene\xe2\x80\x94or one with livid scarlet wounds half escaped from their\r\nfilthy bandages. These desperate ones were the dregs of the city\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncesspools, wretches who hid at night in the rain-soaked cellars of old\r\nramshackle tenements, in \xe2\x80\x9cstale-beer dives\xe2\x80\x9d and opium joints, with\r\nabandoned women in the last stages of the harlot\xe2\x80\x99s progress\xe2\x80\x94women who\r\nhad been kept by Chinamen and turned away at last to die. Every day the\r\npolice net would drag hundreds of them off the streets, and in the\r\ndetention hospital you might see them, herded together in a miniature\r\ninferno, with hideous, beastly faces, bloated and leprous with disease,\r\nlaughing, shouting, screaming in all stages of drunkenness, barking\r\nlike dogs, gibbering like apes, raving and tearing themselves in\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the face of all his handicaps, Jurgis was obliged to make the price\r\nof a lodging, and of a drink every hour or two, under penalty of\r\nfreezing to death. Day after day he roamed about in the arctic cold,\r\nhis soul filled full of bitterness and despair. He saw the world of\r\ncivilization then more plainly than ever he had seen it before; a world\r\nin which nothing counted but brutal might, an order devised by those\r\nwho possessed it for the subjugation of those who did not. He was one\r\nof the latter; and all outdoors, all life, was to him one colossal\r\nprison, which he paced like a pent-up tiger, trying one bar after\r\nanother, and finding them all beyond his power. He had lost in the\r\nfierce battle of greed, and so was doomed to be exterminated; and all\r\nsociety was busied to see that he did not escape the sentence.\r\nEverywhere that he turned were prison bars, and hostile eyes following\r\nhim; the well-fed, sleek policemen, from whose glances he shrank, and\r\nwho seemed to grip their clubs more tightly when they saw him; the\r\nsaloon-keepers, who never ceased to watch him while he was in their\r\nplaces, who were jealous of every moment he lingered after he had paid\r\nhis money; the hurrying throngs upon the streets, who were deaf to his\r\nentreaties, oblivious of his very existence\xe2\x80\x94and savage and contemptuous\r\nwhen he forced himself upon them. They had their own affairs, and there\r\nwas no place for him among them. There was no place for him\r\nanywhere\xe2\x80\x94every direction he turned his gaze, this fact was forced upon\r\nhim: Everything was built to express it to him: the residences, with\r\ntheir heavy walls and bolted doors, and basement windows barred with\r\niron; the great warehouses filled with the products of the whole world,\r\nand guarded by iron shutters and heavy gates; the banks with their\r\nunthinkable billions of wealth, all buried in safes and vaults of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day there befell Jurgis the one adventure of his life. It\r\nwas late at night, and he had failed to get the price of a lodging.\r\nSnow was falling, and he had been out so long that he was covered with\r\nit, and was chilled to the bone. He was working among the theater\r\ncrowds, flitting here and there, taking large chances with the police,\r\nin his desperation half hoping to be arrested. When he saw a blue-coat\r\nstart toward him, however, his heart failed him, and he dashed down a\r\nside street and fled a couple of blocks. When he stopped again he saw a\r\nman coming toward him, and placed himself in his path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in the usual formula, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you give me the\r\nprice of a lodging? I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a broken arm, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t work, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnot a cent in my pocket. I\xe2\x80\x99m an honest working-man, sir, and I never\r\nbegged before! It\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis usually went on until he was interrupted, but this man did not\r\ninterrupt, and so at last he came to a breathless stop. The other had\r\nhalted, and Jurgis suddenly noticed that he stood a little unsteadily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhuzzat you say?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried suddenly, in a thick voice.\r\n\r\nJurgis began again, speaking more slowly and distinctly; before he was\r\nhalf through the other put out his hand and rested it upon his\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor ole chappie!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen up\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94up\xe2\x80\x94against it,\r\nhey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he lurched toward Jurgis, and the hand upon his shoulder became an\r\narm about his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cUp against it myself, ole sport,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na hard ole world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were close to a lamppost, and Jurgis got a glimpse of the other.\r\nHe was a young fellow\xe2\x80\x94not much over eighteen, with a handsome boyish\r\nface. He wore a silk hat and a rich soft overcoat with a fur collar;\r\nand he smiled at Jurgis with benignant sympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hard up, too, my\r\ngoo\xe2\x80\x99 fren\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got cruel parents, or I\xe2\x80\x99d set you up.\r\nWhuzzamatter whizyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHospital!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young fellow, still smiling sweetly, \xe2\x80\x9cthass\r\ntoo bad! Same\xe2\x80\x99s my Aunt Polly\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94my Aunt Polly\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94ole auntie\xe2\x80\x99s been havin\xe2\x80\x99 twins!

I wish somebody\xe2\x80\x99d break _my_ arm, ole chappie\xe2\x80\x94damfidon\xe2\x80\x99t! Then\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d treat me better\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94hole me up, ole sport!

The latter was glancing\r\nabout nervously, lest some one should approach. They were still alone,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I came all right, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the youngster,\r\naggressively, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94I can have my own way when I want it, by\r\nHarry\xe2\x80\x94Freddie Jones is a hard man to handle when he gets goin\xe2\x80\x99! \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98by thunder, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anybody goin\xe2\x80\x99 home with me,\r\neither\xe2\x80\x94whujja take me for, hey?

You\xe2\x80\x99re up against it, same as me, an\xe2\x80\x99 you can unerstan\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nfeller; your heart\xe2\x80\x99s in the right place, by Harry\xe2\x80\x94come \xe2\x80\x99long, ole\r\nchappie, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll light up the house, an\xe2\x80\x99 have some fizz, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nraise hell, we will\xe2\x80\x94whoop-la!

Hip! hip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had started down the street, arm in arm, the young man pushing\r\nJurgis along, half dazed. Jurgis was trying to think what to do\xe2\x80\x94he knew\r\nhe could not pass any crowded place with his new acquaintance without\r\nattracting attention and being stopped. It was only because of the\r\nfalling snow that people who passed here did not notice anything wrong.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, therefore, Jurgis stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it very far?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cTired, are you, though? Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nride\xe2\x80\x94whatcha say? Good! Call a cab!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, gripping Jurgis tight with one hand, the young fellow began\r\nsearching his pockets with the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou call, ole sport, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npay,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he pulled out from somewhere a big roll of bills. It was more money\r\nthan Jurgis had ever seen in his life before, and he stared at it with\r\nstartled eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks like a lot, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Freddie, fumbling with it. \xe2\x80\x9cFool\r\nyou, though, ole chappie\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re all little ones! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be busted in one\r\nweek more, sure thing\xe2\x80\x94word of honor. An\xe2\x80\x99 not a cent more till the\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94guv\xe2\x80\x99ner\xe2\x80\x99s orders\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94not a _cent_, by Harry! Nuff to set a\r\nfeller crazy, it is. I sent him a cable, this af\xe2\x80\x99noon\xe2\x80\x94thass one reason\r\nmore why I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 home. \xe2\x80\x98Hangin\xe2\x80\x99 on the verge of starvation,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsays\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98for the honor of the family\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94sen\xe2\x80\x99 me some bread. Hunger will\r\ncompel me to join you\xe2\x80\x94Freddie.\xe2\x80\x99 Thass what I wired him, by Harry, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nmean it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll run away from school, b\xe2\x80\x99God, if he don\xe2\x80\x99t sen\xe2\x80\x99 me some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this fashion the young gentleman continued to prattle on\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nmeantime Jurgis was trembling with excitement. He might grab that wad\r\nof bills and be out of sight in the darkness before the other could\r\ncollect his wits. Should he do it? What better had he to hope for, if\r\nhe waited longer? But Jurgis had never committed a crime in his life,\r\nand now he hesitated half a second too long. \xe2\x80\x9cFreddie\xe2\x80\x9d got one bill\r\nloose, and then stuffed the rest back into his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, ole man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou take it.\xe2\x80\x9d He held it out fluttering.\r\nThey were in front of a saloon; and by the light of the window Jurgis\r\nsaw that it was a hundred-dollar bill! \xe2\x80\x9cYou take it,\xe2\x80\x9d the other\r\nrepeated. \xe2\x80\x9cPay the cabbie an\xe2\x80\x99 keep the change\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94no head for\r\nbusiness! Guv\xe2\x80\x99ner says so hisself, an\xe2\x80\x99 the guv\xe2\x80\x99ner knows\xe2\x80\x94the guv\xe2\x80\x99ner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot a head for business, you bet! \xe2\x80\x98All right, guv\xe2\x80\x99ner,\xe2\x80\x99 I told him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you run the show, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the tickets!\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 so he set Aunt Polly\r\nto watch me\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 now Polly\xe2\x80\x99s off in the hospital havin\xe2\x80\x99 twins, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme out raisin\xe2\x80\x99 Cain! Hello, there! Hey! Call him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cab was driving by; and Jurgis sprang and called, and it swung round\r\nto the curb. Master Freddie clambered in with some difficulty, and\r\nJurgis had started to follow, when the driver shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cHi, there! Get\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated, and was half obeying; but his companion broke out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhuzzat? Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the cabbie subsided, and Jurgis climbed in. Then Freddie gave a\r\nnumber on the Lake Shore Drive, and the carriage started away. The\r\nyoungster leaned back and snuggled up to Jurgis, murmuring contentedly;\r\nin half a minute he was sound asleep, Jurgis sat shivering, speculating\r\nas to whether he might not still be able to get hold of the roll of\r\nbills. He was afraid to try to go through his companion\xe2\x80\x99s pockets,\r\nhowever; and besides the cabbie might be on the watch. He had the\r\nhundred safe, and he would have to be content with that.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour or so the cab stopped. They were out on the\r\nwaterfront, and from the east a freezing gale was blowing off the\r\nice-bound lake. \xe2\x80\x9cHere we are,\xe2\x80\x9d called the cabbie, and Jurgis awakened\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\nMaster Freddie sat up with a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we? Whuzzis? Who are you, hey? Oh, yes,\r\nsure nuff! Mos\xe2\x80\x99 forgot you\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94ole chappie! Home, are we? Lessee!\r\nBr-r-r\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s cold! Yes\xe2\x80\x94come \xe2\x80\x99long\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re home\xe2\x80\x94it ever so\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94humble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore them there loomed an enormous granite pile, set far back from\r\nthe street, and occupying a whole block. By the light of the driveway\r\nlamps Jurgis could see that it had towers and huge gables, like a\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val castle. He thought that the young fellow must have made a\r\nmistake\xe2\x80\x94it was inconceivable to him that any person could have a home\r\nlike a hotel or the city hall. But he followed in silence, and they\r\nwent up the long flight of steps, arm in arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a button here, ole sport,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Freddie. \xe2\x80\x9cHole my arm\r\nwhile I find her! Steady, now\xe2\x80\x94oh, yes, here she is! Saved!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA bell rang, and in a few seconds the door was opened. A man in blue\r\nlivery stood holding it, and gazing before him, silent as a statue.\r\n\r\nThey stood for a moment blinking in the light. Then Jurgis felt his\r\ncompanion pulling, and he stepped in, and the blue automaton closed the\r\ndoor. Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s heart was beating wildly; it was a bold thing for him to\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94into what strange unearthly place he was venturing he had no idea.\r\nAladdin entering his cave could not have been more excited.\r\n\r\nThe place where he stood was dimly lighted; but he could see a vast\r\nhall, with pillars fading into the darkness above, and a great\r\nstaircase opening at the far end of it. The floor was of tesselated\r\nmarble, smooth as glass, and from the walls strange shapes loomed out,\r\nwoven into huge portieres in rich, harmonious colors, or gleaming from\r\npaintings, wonderful and mysterious-looking in the half-light, purple\r\nand red and golden, like sunset glimmers in a shadowy forest.\r\n\r\nThe man in livery had moved silently toward them; Master Freddie took\r\noff his hat and handed it to him, and then, letting go of Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99 arm,\r\ntried to get out of his overcoat. After two or three attempts he\r\naccomplished this, with the lackey\xe2\x80\x99s help, and meantime a second man\r\nhad approached, a tall and portly personage, solemn as an executioner.\r\nHe bore straight down upon Jurgis, who shrank away nervously; he seized\r\nhim by the arm without a word, and started toward the door with him.\r\nThen suddenly came Master Freddie\xe2\x80\x99s voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHamilton! My fren\xe2\x80\x99 will\r\nremain wiz me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man paused and half released Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cCome \xe2\x80\x99long ole chappie,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe other, and Jurgis started toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Frederick!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee that the cabbie\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94is paid,\xe2\x80\x9d was the other\xe2\x80\x99s response; and he\r\nlinked his arm in Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99. Jurgis was about to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI have the money\r\nfor him,\xe2\x80\x9d but he restrained himself. The stout man in uniform signaled\r\nto the other, who went out to the cab, while he followed Jurgis and his\r\nyoung master.\r\n\r\nThey went down the great hall, and then turned. Before them were two\r\nhuge doors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHamilton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Freddie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhuzzamatter wizze dinin\xe2\x80\x99-room doors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is the matter, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why dontcha openum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man rolled them back; another vista lost itself in the darkness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLights,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Master Freddie; and the butler pressed a button,\r\nand a flood of brilliant incandescence streamed from above,\r\nhalf-blinding Jurgis. He stared; and little by little he made out the\r\ngreat apartment, with a domed ceiling from which the light poured, and\r\nwalls that were one enormous painting\xe2\x80\x94nymphs and dryads dancing in a\r\nflower-strewn glade\xe2\x80\x94Diana with her hounds and horses, dashing headlong\r\nthrough a mountain streamlet\xe2\x80\x94a group of maidens bathing in a forest\r\npool\xe2\x80\x94all life-size, and so real that Jurgis thought that it was some\r\nwork of enchantment, that he was in a dream palace. Then his eye passed\r\nto the long table in the center of the hall, a table black as ebony,\r\nand gleaming with wrought silver and gold. In the center of it was a\r\nhuge carven bowl, with the glistening gleam of ferns and the red and\r\npurple of rare orchids, glowing from a light hidden somewhere in their\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis\xe2\x80\x99s the dinin\xe2\x80\x99 room,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Master Freddie. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you like it,\r\nhey, ole sport?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe always insisted on having an answer to his remarks, leaning over\r\nJurgis and smiling into his face. Jurgis liked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRummy ole place to feed in all \xe2\x80\x99lone, though,\xe2\x80\x9d was Freddie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crummy\xe2\x80\x99s hell! Whuzya think, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d Then another idea occurred\r\nto him and he went on, without waiting: \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you never saw\r\nanythin\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94like this \xe2\x80\x99fore? Hey, ole chappie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome from country, maybe\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! I thosso! Lossa folks from country never saw such a place.\r\nGuv\xe2\x80\x99ner brings \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94free show\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94reg\xe2\x80\x99lar circus!

Ever hear of Jones the packer, hey, ole chappie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis had started involuntarily; the other, whose sharp eyes missed\r\nnothing, demanded: \xe2\x80\x9cWhuzzamatter, hey? Heard of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis managed to stammer out: \xe2\x80\x9cI have worked for him in the\r\nyards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Master Freddie, with a yell. \xe2\x80\x9c_You!_ In the yards? Ho,\r\nho! Why, say, thass good! Shake hands on it, ole man\xe2\x80\x94by Harry! Guv\xe2\x80\x99ner\r\nought to be here\xe2\x80\x94glad to see you.

Hey, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the butler again bowed his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at which\r\nMaster Freddie hung tightly upon Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s neck and went into a fit of\r\nlaughter. \xe2\x80\x9cHamilton, you damn ole scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99scharge\r\nyou for impudence, you see \xe2\x80\x99f I don\xe2\x80\x99t!

Hear me, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butler, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, Master Frederick, your father left\r\norders\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Master Frederick drew himself up to a stately height. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders were left to me\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 not to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Then, clasping\r\nJurgis tightly by the neck, he staggered out of the room; on the way\r\nanother idea occurred to him, and he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAny\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94cable message for\r\nme, Hamilton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuv\xe2\x80\x99ner must be travelin\xe2\x80\x99. An\xe2\x80\x99 how\xe2\x80\x99s the twins, Hamilton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are doing well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Freddie; and added fervently: \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless \xe2\x80\x99em, the\r\nlittle lambs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went up the great staircase, one step at a time; at the top of it\r\nthere gleamed at them out of the shadows the figure of a nymph\r\ncrouching by a fountain, a figure ravishingly beautiful, the flesh warm\r\nand glowing with the hues of life. Above was a huge court, with domed\r\nroof, the various apartments opening into it. The butler had paused\r\nbelow but a few minutes to give orders, and then followed them; now he\r\npressed a button, and the hall blazed with light. He opened a door\r\nbefore them, and then pressed another button, as they staggered into\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nIt was fitted up as a study. In the center was a mahogany table,\r\ncovered with books, and smokers\xe2\x80\x99 implements; the walls were decorated\r\nwith college trophies and colors\xe2\x80\x94flags, posters, photographs and\r\nknickknacks\xe2\x80\x94tennis rackets, canoe paddles, golf clubs, and polo sticks.\r\nAn enormous moose head, with horns six feet across, faced a buffalo\r\nhead on the opposite wall, while bear and tiger skins covered the\r\npolished floor. There were lounging chairs and sofas, window seats\r\ncovered with soft cushions of fantastic designs; there was one corner\r\nfitted in Persian fashion, with a huge canopy and a jeweled lamp\r\nbeneath. Beyond, a door opened upon a bedroom, and beyond that was a\r\nswimming pool of the purest marble, that had cost about forty thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nMaster Freddie stood for a moment or two, gazing about him; then out of\r\nthe next room a dog emerged, a monstrous bulldog, the most hideous\r\nobject that Jurgis had ever laid eyes upon. He yawned, opening a mouth\r\nlike a dragon\xe2\x80\x99s; and he came toward the young man, wagging his tail.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Dewey!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his master. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen havin\xe2\x80\x99 a snooze, ole boy? Well,\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94hello there, whuzzamatter?\xe2\x80\x9d (The dog was snarling at Jurgis.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Dewey\xe2\x80\x94this\xe2\x80\x99 my fren\xe2\x80\x99, Mr. Rednose\xe2\x80\x94ole fren\xe2\x80\x99 the guv\xe2\x80\x99ner\xe2\x80\x99s! Mr.\r\nRednose, Admiral Dewey; shake han\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94hic. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t he a daisy, though\xe2\x80\x94blue\r\nribbon at the New York show\xe2\x80\x94eighty-five hundred at a clip! How\xe2\x80\x99s that,\r\nhey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker sank into one of the big armchairs, and Admiral Dewey\r\ncrouched beneath it; he did not snarl again, but he never took his eyes\r\noff Jurgis. He was perfectly sober, was the Admiral.\r\n\r\nThe butler had closed the door, and he stood by it, watching Jurgis\r\nevery second. Now there came footsteps outside, and, as he opened the\r\ndoor a man in livery entered, carrying a folding table, and behind him\r\ntwo men with covered trays. They stood like statues while the first\r\nspread the table and set out the contents of the trays upon it. There\r\nwere cold pates, and thin slices of meat, tiny bread and butter\r\nsandwiches with the crust cut off, a bowl of sliced peaches and cream\r\n(in January), little fancy cakes, pink and green and yellow and white,\r\nand half a dozen ice-cold bottles of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThass the stuff for you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Master Freddie, exultantly, as he\r\nspied them. \xe2\x80\x9cCome \xe2\x80\x99long, ole chappie, move up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he seated himself at the table; the waiter pulled a cork, and he\r\ntook the bottle and poured three glasses of its contents in succession\r\ndown his throat. Then he gave a long-drawn sigh, and cried again to\r\nJurgis to seat himself.\r\n\r\nThe butler held the chair at the opposite side of the table, and Jurgis\r\nthought it was to keep him out of it; but finally he understand that it\r\nwas the other\xe2\x80\x99s intention to put it under him, and so he sat down,\r\ncautiously and mistrustingly. Master Freddie perceived that the\r\nattendants embarrassed him, and he remarked with a nod to them, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmay go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went, all save the butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go too, Hamilton,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Frederick\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the man began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the youngster, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man went out and closed the door; Jurgis, who was as sharp as he,\r\nobserved that he took the key out of the lock, in order that he might\r\npeer through the keyhole.\r\n\r\nMaster Frederick turned to the table again. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgo for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis gazed at him doubtingly. \xe2\x80\x9cEat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other. \xe2\x80\x9cPile in, ole\r\nchappie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want anything?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly thirsty. Kitty and me had some\r\ncandy\xe2\x80\x94you go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis began, without further parley. He ate as with two shovels,\r\nhis fork in one hand and his knife in the other; when he once got\r\nstarted his wolf-hunger got the better of him, and he did not stop for\r\nbreath until he had cleared every plate. \xe2\x80\x9cGee whiz!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other,\r\nwho had been watching him in wonder.\r\n\r\nThen he held Jurgis the bottle. \xe2\x80\x9cLessee you drink now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and\r\nJurgis took the bottle and turned it up to his mouth, and a wonderfully\r\nunearthly liquid ecstasy poured down his throat, tickling every nerve\r\nof him, thrilling him with joy. He drank the very last drop of it, and\r\nthen he gave vent to a long-drawn \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood stuff, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Freddie, sympathetically; he had leaned back in\r\nthe big chair, putting his arm behind his head and gazing at Jurgis.\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis gazed back at him. He was clad in spotless evening dress,\r\nwas Freddie, and looked very handsome\xe2\x80\x94he was a beautiful boy, with\r\nlight golden hair and the head of an Antinous. He smiled at Jurgis\r\nconfidingly, and then started talking again, with his blissful\r\n_insouciance_. This time he talked for ten minutes at a stretch, and in\r\nthe course of the speech he told Jurgis all of his family history. His\r\nbig brother Charlie was in love with the guileless maiden who played\r\nthe part of \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Bright-Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kaliph of Kamskatka.\xe2\x80\x9d He had\r\nbeen on the verge of marrying her once, only \xe2\x80\x9cthe guv\xe2\x80\x99ner\xe2\x80\x9d had sworn to\r\ndisinherit him, and had presented him with a sum that would stagger the\r\nimagination, and that had staggered the virtue of \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Bright-Eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNow Charlie had got leave from college, and had gone away in his\r\nautomobile on the next best thing to a honeymoon. \xe2\x80\x9cThe guv\xe2\x80\x99ner\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nmade threats to disinherit another of his children also, sister\r\nGwendolen, who had married an Italian marquis with a string of titles\r\nand a dueling record. They lived in his chateau, or rather had, until\r\nhe had taken to firing the breakfast dishes at her; then she had cabled\r\nfor help, and the old gentleman had gone over to find out what were his\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s terms. So they had left Freddie all alone, and he with less\r\nthan two thousand dollars in his pocket. Freddie was up in arms and\r\nmeant serious business, as they would find in the end\xe2\x80\x94if there was no\r\nother way of bringing them to terms he would have his \xe2\x80\x9cKittens\xe2\x80\x9d wire\r\nthat she was about to marry him, and see what happened then.\r\n\r\nSo the cheerful youngster rattled on, until he was tired out. He smiled\r\nhis sweetest smile at Jurgis, and then he closed his eyes, sleepily.\r\nThen he opened them again, and smiled once more, and finally closed\r\nthem and forgot to open them.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes Jurgis sat perfectly motionless, watching him, and\r\nreveling in the strange sensation of the champagne. Once he stirred,\r\nand the dog growled; after that he sat almost holding his breath\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nafter a while the door of the room opened softly, and the butler came\r\nin.\r\n\r\nHe walked toward Jurgis upon tiptoe, scowling at him; and Jurgis rose\r\nup, and retreated, scowling back. So until he was against the wall, and\r\nthen the butler came close, and pointed toward the door. \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\nJurgis hesitated, giving a glance at Freddie, who was snoring softly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do, you son of a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d hissed the butler, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll mash in your face\r\nfor you before you get out of here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis wavered but an instant more. He saw \xe2\x80\x9cAdmiral Dewey\xe2\x80\x9d coming\r\nup behind the man and growling softly, to back up his threats. Then he\r\nsurrendered and started toward the door.\r\n\r\nThey went out without a sound, and down the great echoing staircase,\r\nand through the dark hall. At the front door he paused, and the butler\r\nstrode close to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold up your hands,\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled. Jurgis took a step back, clinching\r\nhis one well fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; and then understanding that the fellow proposed\r\nto search him, he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you in hell first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go to jail?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the butler, menacingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave the police\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Jurgis, with fierce passion. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t put your\r\nhands on me till you do! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t touched anything in your damned\r\nhouse, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll not have you touch me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the butler, who was terrified lest his young master should waken,\r\nstepped suddenly to the door, and opened it. \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of here!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; and then as Jurgis passed through the opening, he gave him a\r\nferocious kick that sent him down the great stone steps at a run, and\r\nlanded him sprawling in the snow at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis got up, wild with rage, but the door was shut and the great\r\ncastle was dark and impregnable. Then the icy teeth of the blast bit\r\ninto him, and he turned and went away at a run.\r\n\r\nWhen he stopped again it was because he was coming to frequented\r\nstreets and did not wish to attract attention. In spite of that last\r\nhumiliation, his heart was thumping fast with triumph. He had come out\r\nahead on that deal! He put his hand into his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pocket every now\r\nand then, to make sure that the precious hundred-dollar bill was still\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nYet he was in a plight\xe2\x80\x94a curious and even dreadful plight, when he came\r\nto realize it. He had not a single cent but that one bill! And he had\r\nto find some shelter that night he had to change it!\r\n\r\nJurgis spent half an hour walking and debating the problem. There was\r\nno one he could go to for help\xe2\x80\x94he had to manage it all alone. To get it\r\nchanged in a lodging-house would be to take his life in his hands\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwould almost certainly be robbed, and perhaps murdered, before morning.\r\nHe might go to some hotel or railroad depot and ask to have it changed;\r\nbut what would they think, seeing a \xe2\x80\x9cbum\xe2\x80\x9d like him with a hundred\r\ndollars? He would probably be arrested if he tried it; and what story\r\ncould he tell? On the morrow Freddie Jones would discover his loss, and\r\nthere would be a hunt for him, and he would lose his money. The only\r\nother plan he could think of was to try in a saloon. He might pay them\r\nto change it, if it could not be done otherwise.\r\n\r\nHe began peering into places as he walked; he passed several as being\r\ntoo crowded\xe2\x80\x94then finally, chancing upon one where the bartender was all\r\nalone, he gripped his hands in sudden resolution and went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you change me a hundred-dollar bill?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe bartender was a big, husky fellow, with the jaw of a prize fighter,\r\nand a three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 stubble of hair upon it. He stared at Jurgis.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that youse say?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said, could you change me a hundred-dollar bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d youse get it?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, and I want it changed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npay you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other stared at him hard. \xe2\x80\x9cLemme see it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you change it?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis demanded, gripping it tightly in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the hell can I know if it\xe2\x80\x99s good or not?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the bartender.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatcher take me for, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Jurgis slowly and warily approached him; he took out the bill, and\r\nfumbled it for a moment, while the man stared at him with hostile eyes\r\nacross the counter. Then finally he handed it over.\r\n\r\nThe other took it, and began to examine it; he smoothed it between his\r\nfingers, and held it up to the light; he turned it over, and upside\r\ndown, and edgeways. It was new and rather stiff, and that made him\r\ndubious. Jurgis was watching him like a cat all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, finally, and gazed at the stranger, sizing him up\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nragged, ill-smelling tramp, with no overcoat and one arm in a sling\xe2\x80\x94and\r\na hundred-dollar bill! \xe2\x80\x9cWant to buy anything?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a glass of beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll change it.\xe2\x80\x9d And he put the bill in\r\nhis pocket, and poured Jurgis out a glass of beer, and set it on the\r\ncounter. Then he turned to the cash register, and punched up five\r\ncents, and began to pull money out of the drawer. Finally, he faced\r\nJurgis, counting it out\xe2\x80\x94two dimes, a quarter, and fifty cents. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nFor a second Jurgis waited, expecting to see him turn again. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nninety-nine dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ninety-nine dollars?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the bartender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy change!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe rest of my hundred!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bartender, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re nutty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis stared at him with wild eyes. For an instant horror reigned\r\nin him\xe2\x80\x94black, paralyzing, awful horror, clutching him at the heart; and\r\nthen came rage, in surging, blinding floods\xe2\x80\x94he screamed aloud, and\r\nseized the glass and hurled it at the other\xe2\x80\x99s head. The man ducked, and\r\nit missed him by half an inch; he rose again and faced Jurgis, who was\r\nvaulting over the bar with his one well arm, and dealt him a smashing\r\nblow in the face, hurling him backward upon the floor. Then, as Jurgis\r\nscrambled to his feet again and started round the counter after him, he\r\nshouted at the top of his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis seized a bottle off the counter as he ran; and as the bartender\r\nmade a leap he hurled the missile at him with all his force. It just\r\ngrazed his head, and shivered into a thousand pieces against the post\r\nof the door. Then Jurgis started back, rushing at the man again in the\r\nmiddle of the room. This time, in his blind frenzy, he came without a\r\nbottle, and that was all the bartender wanted\xe2\x80\x94he met him halfway and\r\nfloored him with a sledgehammer drive between the eyes. An instant\r\nlater the screen doors flew open, and two men rushed in\xe2\x80\x94just as Jurgis\r\nwas getting to his feet again, foaming at the mouth with rage, and\r\ntrying to tear his broken arm out of its bandages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the bartender. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got a knife!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, seeing\r\nthat the two were disposed to join the fray, he made another rush at\r\nJurgis, and knocked aside his feeble defense and sent him tumbling\r\nagain; and the three flung themselves upon him, rolling and kicking\r\nabout the place.\r\n\r\nA second later a policeman dashed in, and the bartender yelled once\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLook out for his knife!\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis had fought himself half to his\r\nknees, when the policeman made a leap at him, and cracked him across\r\nthe face with his club. Though the blow staggered him, the wild-beast\r\nfrenzy still blazed in him, and he got to his feet, lunging into the\r\nair. Then again the club descended, full upon his head, and he dropped\r\nlike a log to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe policeman crouched over him, clutching his stick, waiting for him\r\nto try to rise again; and meantime the barkeeper got up, and put his\r\nhand to his head. \xe2\x80\x9cChrist!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was done for that\r\ntime. Did he cut me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t see anything, Jake,\xe2\x80\x9d said the policeman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust crazy drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cA lame duck, too\xe2\x80\x94but he \xe2\x80\x99most got\r\nme under the bar. Youse had better call the wagon, Billy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got no more fight in him, I guess\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s only got a block to go.\xe2\x80\x9d He twisted his hand in Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s collar\r\nand jerked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cGit up here, you!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded.\r\n\r\nBut Jurgis did not move, and the bartender went behind the bar, and\r\nafter stowing the hundred-dollar bill away in a safe hiding place, came\r\nand poured a glass of water over Jurgis. Then, as the latter began to\r\nmoan feebly, the policeman got him to his feet and dragged him out of\r\nthe place. The station house was just around the corner, and so in a\r\nfew minutes Jurgis was in a cell.\r\n\r\nHe spent half the night lying unconscious, and the balance moaning in\r\ntorment, with a blinding headache and a racking thirst. Now and then he\r\ncried aloud for a drink of water, but there was no one to hear him.\r\nThere were others in that same station house with split heads and a\r\nfever; there were hundreds of them in the great city, and tens of\r\nthousands of them in the great land, and there was no one to hear any\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Jurgis was given a cup of water and a piece of bread,\r\nand then hustled into a patrol wagon and driven to the nearest police\r\ncourt. He sat in the pen with a score of others until his turn came.\r\n\r\nThe bartender\xe2\x80\x94who proved to be a well-known bruiser\xe2\x80\x94was called to the\r\nstand. He took the oath and told his story. The prisoner had come into\r\nhis saloon after midnight, fighting drunk, and had ordered a glass of\r\nbeer and tendered a dollar bill in payment. He had been given\r\nninety-five cents\xe2\x80\x99 change, and had demanded ninety-nine dollars more,\r\nand before the plaintiff could even answer had hurled the glass at him\r\nand then attacked him with a bottle of bitters, and nearly wrecked the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThen the prisoner was sworn\xe2\x80\x94a forlorn object, haggard and unshorn, with\r\nan arm done up in a filthy bandage, a cheek and head cut, and bloody,\r\nand one eye purplish black and entirely closed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to say\r\nfor yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cI went into his place and asked the man if\r\nhe could change me a hundred-dollar bill. And he said he would if I\r\nbought a drink. I gave him the bill and then he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me the\r\nchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate was staring at him in perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave him a\r\nhundred-dollar bill!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man gave it to me, your Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man? What man, and what for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young man I met upon the street, your Honor. I had been begging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a titter in the courtroom; the officer who was holding Jurgis\r\nput up his hand to hide a smile, and the magistrate smiled without\r\ntrying to hide it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true, your Honor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jurgis, passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had been drinking as well as begging last night, had you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired the magistrate. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, your Honor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d protested Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had not had anything to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, your Honor, I had\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a bottle of something\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it was\xe2\x80\x94something that\r\nburned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was again a laugh round the courtroom, stopping suddenly as the\r\nmagistrate looked up and frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been arrested before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe question took Jurgis aback. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the truth, now!\xe2\x80\x9d commanded the other, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly once, your Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor knocking down my boss, your Honor. I was working in the\r\nstockyards, and he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Honor; \xe2\x80\x9cI guess that will do. You ought to stop\r\ndrinking if you can\xe2\x80\x99t control yourself. Ten days and costs. Next case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis gave vent to a cry of dismay, cut off suddenly by the policeman,\r\nwho seized him by the collar. He was jerked out of the way, into a room\r\nwith the convicted prisoners, where he sat and wept like a child in his\r\nimpotent rage. It seemed monstrous to him that policemen and judges\r\nshould esteem his word as nothing in comparison with the\r\nbartender\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94poor Jurgis could not know that the owner of the saloon\r\npaid five dollars each week to the policeman alone for Sunday\r\nprivileges and general favors\xe2\x80\x94nor that the pugilist bartender was one\r\nof the most trusted henchmen of the Democratic leader of the district,\r\nand had helped only a few months before to hustle out a record-breaking\r\nvote as a testimonial to the magistrate, who had been made the target\r\nof odious kid-gloved reformers.\r\n\r\nJurgis was driven out to the Bridewell for the second time. In his\r\ntumbling around he had hurt his arm again, and so could not work, but\r\nhad to be attended by the physician. Also his head and his eye had to\r\nbe tied up\xe2\x80\x94and so he was a pretty-looking object when, the second day\r\nafter his arrival, he went out into the exercise court and\r\nencountered\xe2\x80\x94Jack Duane!\r\n\r\nThe young fellow was so glad to see Jurgis that he almost hugged him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98the Stinker\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is it\xe2\x80\x94have you\r\nbeen through a sausage machine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a railroad wreck and a fight.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen, while some of the other prisoners gathered round he told his wild\r\nstory; most of them were incredulous, but Duane knew that Jurgis could\r\nnever have made up such a yarn as that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard luck, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when they were alone; \xe2\x80\x9cbut maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaught you a lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve learned some things since I saw you last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis\r\nmournfully. Then he explained how he had spent the last summer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9choboing it,\xe2\x80\x9d as the phrase was. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked finally. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nbeen here ever since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI only came in the day before yesterday.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the second time they\xe2\x80\x99ve sent me up on a trumped-up charge\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nhard luck and can\xe2\x80\x99t pay them what they want. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you quit Chicago\r\nwith me, Jurgis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no place to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither have I,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, laughing lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\ntill we get out and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the Bridewell Jurgis met few who had been there the last time, but\r\nhe met scores of others, old and young, of exactly the same sort. It\r\nwas like breakers upon a beach; there was new water, but the wave\r\nlooked just the same. He strolled about and talked with them, and the\r\nbiggest of them told tales of their prowess, while those who were\r\nweaker, or younger and inexperienced, gathered round and listened in\r\nadmiring silence. The last time he was there, Jurgis had thought of\r\nlittle but his family; but now he was free to listen to these men, and\r\nto realize that he was one of them\xe2\x80\x94that their point of view was his\r\npoint of view, and that the way they kept themselves alive in the world\r\nwas the way he meant to do it in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when he was turned out of prison again, without a penny in his\r\npocket, he went straight to Jack Duane. He went full of humility and\r\ngratitude; for Duane was a gentleman, and a man with a profession\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit was remarkable that he should be willing to throw in his lot with a\r\nhumble workingman, one who had even been a beggar and a tramp. Jurgis\r\ncould not see what help he could be to him; but he did not understand\r\nthat a man like himself\xe2\x80\x94who could be trusted to stand by any one who\r\nwas kind to him\xe2\x80\x94was as rare among criminals as among any other class of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe address Jurgis had was a garret room in the Ghetto district, the\r\nhome of a pretty little French girl, Duane\xe2\x80\x99s mistress, who sewed all\r\nday, and eked out her living by prostitution. He had gone elsewhere,\r\nshe told Jurgis\xe2\x80\x94he was afraid to stay there now, on account of the\r\npolice. The new address was a cellar dive, whose proprietor said that\r\nhe had never heard of Duane; but after he had put Jurgis through a\r\ncatechism he showed him a back stairs which led to a \xe2\x80\x9cfence\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nrear of a pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and thence to a number of assignation\r\nrooms, in one of which Duane was hiding.\r\n\r\nDuane was glad to see him; he was without a cent of money, he said, and\r\nhad been waiting for Jurgis to help him get some. He explained his\r\nplan\xe2\x80\x94in fact he spent the day in laying bare to his friend the criminal\r\nworld of the city, and in showing him how he might earn himself a\r\nliving in it. That winter he would have a hard time, on account of his\r\narm, and because of an unwonted fit of activity of the police; but so\r\nlong as he was unknown to them he would be safe if he were careful.\r\nHere at \xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xe2\x80\x9d Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s (so they called the old man who kept the dive)\r\nhe might rest at ease, for \xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xe2\x80\x9d Hanson was \xe2\x80\x9csquare\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would stand by\r\nhim so long as he paid, and gave him an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice if there were to\r\nbe a police raid. Also Rosensteg, the pawnbroker, would buy anything he\r\nhad for a third of its value, and guarantee to keep it hidden for a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThere was an oil stove in the little cupboard of a room, and they had\r\nsome supper; and then about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night they sallied forth\r\ntogether, by a rear entrance to the place, Duane armed with a\r\nslingshot. They came to a residence district, and he sprang up a\r\nlamppost and blew out the light, and then the two dodged into the\r\nshelter of an area step and hid in silence.\r\n\r\nPretty soon a man came by, a workingman\xe2\x80\x94and they let him go. Then after\r\na long interval came the heavy tread of a policeman, and they held\r\ntheir breath till he was gone. Though half-frozen, they waited a full\r\nquarter of an hour after that\xe2\x80\x94and then again came footsteps, walking\r\nbriskly. Duane nudged Jurgis, and the instant the man had passed they\r\nrose up. Duane stole out as silently as a shadow, and a second later\r\nJurgis heard a thud and a stifled cry. He was only a couple of feet\r\nbehind, and he leaped to stop the man\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, while Duane held him\r\nfast by the arms, as they had agreed. But the man was limp and showed a\r\ntendency to fall, and so Jurgis had only to hold him by the collar,\r\nwhile the other, with swift fingers, went through his pockets\xe2\x80\x94ripping\r\nopen, first his overcoat, and then his coat, and then his vest,\r\nsearching inside and outside, and transferring the contents into his\r\nown pockets. At last, after feeling of the man\xe2\x80\x99s fingers and in his\r\nnecktie, Duane whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d and they dragged him to the\r\narea and dropped him in. Then Jurgis went one way and his friend the\r\nother, walking briskly.\r\n\r\nThe latter arrived first, and Jurgis found him examining the \xe2\x80\x9cswag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was a gold watch, for one thing, with a chain and locket; there\r\nwas a silver pencil, and a matchbox, and a handful of small change, and\r\nfinally a card-case. This last Duane opened feverishly\xe2\x80\x94there were\r\nletters and checks, and two theater-tickets, and at last, in the back\r\npart, a wad of bills. He counted them\xe2\x80\x94there was a twenty, five tens,\r\nfour fives, and three ones. Duane drew a long breath. \xe2\x80\x9cThat lets us\r\nout!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAfter further examination, they burned the card-case and its contents,\r\nall but the bills, and likewise the picture of a little girl in the\r\nlocket. Then Duane took the watch and trinkets downstairs, and came\r\nback with sixteen dollars. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old scoundrel said the case was\r\nfilled,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie, but he knows I want the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey divided up the spoils, and Jurgis got as his share fifty-five\r\ndollars and some change. He protested that it was too much, but the\r\nother had agreed to divide even. That was a good haul, he said, better\r\nthan average.\r\n\r\nWhen they got up in the morning, Jurgis was sent out to buy a paper;\r\none of the pleasures of committing a crime was the reading about it\r\nafterward. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a pal that always did it,\xe2\x80\x9d Duane remarked,\r\nlaughing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cuntil one day he read that he had left three thousand dollars\r\nin a lower inside pocket of his party\xe2\x80\x99s vest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a half-column account of the robbery\xe2\x80\x94it was evident that a\r\ngang was operating in the neighborhood, said the paper, for it was the\r\nthird within a week, and the police were apparently powerless. The\r\nvictim was an insurance agent, and he had lost a hundred and ten\r\ndollars that did not belong to him. He had chanced to have his name\r\nmarked on his shirt, otherwise he would not have been identified yet.\r\nHis assailant had hit him too hard, and he was suffering from\r\nconcussion of the brain; and also he had been half-frozen when found,\r\nand would lose three fingers on his right hand. The enterprising\r\nnewspaper reporter had taken all this information to his family, and\r\ntold how they had received it.\r\n\r\nSince it was Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s first experience, these details naturally caused\r\nhim some worriment; but the other laughed coolly\xe2\x80\x94it was the way of the\r\ngame, and there was no helping it. Before long Jurgis would think no\r\nmore of it than they did in the yards of knocking out a bullock. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na case of us or the other fellow, and I say the other fellow, every\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9che never did us any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was doing it to somebody as hard as he could, you can be sure of\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend.\r\n\r\nDuane had already explained to Jurgis that if a man of their trade were\r\nknown he would have to work all the time to satisfy the demands of the\r\npolice. Therefore it would be better for Jurgis to stay in hiding and\r\nnever be seen in public with his pal. But Jurgis soon got very tired of\r\nstaying in hiding. In a couple of weeks he was feeling strong and\r\nbeginning to use his arm, and then he could not stand it any longer.\r\nDuane, who had done a job of some sort by himself, and made a truce\r\nwith the powers, brought over Marie, his little French girl, to share\r\nwith him; but even that did not avail for long, and in the end he had\r\nto give up arguing, and take Jurgis out and introduce him to the\r\nsaloons and \xe2\x80\x9csporting houses\xe2\x80\x9d where the big crooks and \xe2\x80\x9choldup men\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhung out.\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis got a glimpse of the high-class criminal world of\r\nChicago. The city, which was owned by an oligarchy of business men,\r\nbeing nominally ruled by the people, a huge army of graft was necessary\r\nfor the purpose of effecting the transfer of power. Twice a year, in\r\nthe spring and fall elections, millions of dollars were furnished by\r\nthe business men and expended by this army; meetings were held and\r\nclever speakers were hired, bands played and rockets sizzled, tons of\r\ndocuments and reservoirs of drinks were distributed, and tens of\r\nthousands of votes were bought for cash. And this army of graft had, of\r\ncourse, to be maintained the year round. The leaders and organizers\r\nwere maintained by the business men directly\xe2\x80\x94aldermen and legislators\r\nby means of bribes, party officials out of the campaign funds,\r\nlobbyists and corporation lawyers in the form of salaries, contractors\r\nby means of jobs, labor union leaders by subsidies, and newspaper\r\nproprietors and editors by advertisements. The rank and file, however,\r\nwere either foisted upon the city, or else lived off the population\r\ndirectly. There was the police department, and the fire and water\r\ndepartments, and the whole balance of the civil list, from the meanest\r\noffice boy to the head of a city department; and for the horde who\r\ncould find no room in these, there was the world of vice and crime,\r\nthere was license to seduce, to swindle and plunder and prey. The law\r\nforbade Sunday drinking; and this had delivered the saloon-keepers into\r\nthe hands of the police, and made an alliance between them necessary.\r\nThe law forbade prostitution; and this had brought the \xe2\x80\x9cmadames\xe2\x80\x9d into\r\nthe combination. It was the same with the gambling-house keeper and the\r\npoolroom man, and the same with any other man or woman who had a means\r\nof getting \xe2\x80\x9cgraft,\xe2\x80\x9d and was willing to pay over a share of it: the\r\ngreen-goods man and the highwayman, the pickpocket and the sneak thief,\r\nand the receiver of stolen goods, the seller of adulterated milk, of\r\nstale fruit and diseased meat, the proprietor of unsanitary tenements,\r\nthe fake doctor and the usurer, the beggar and the \xe2\x80\x9cpushcart man,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nprize fighter and the professional slugger, the race-track \xe2\x80\x9ctout,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nprocurer, the white-slave agent, and the expert seducer of young girls.\r\nAll of these agencies of corruption were banded together, and leagued\r\nin blood brotherhood with the politician and the police; more often\r\nthan not they were one and the same person,\xe2\x80\x94the police captain would\r\nown the brothel he pretended to raid, the politician would open his\r\nheadquarters in his saloon. \xe2\x80\x9cHinkydink\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBathhouse John,\xe2\x80\x9d or others\r\nof that ilk, were proprietors of the most notorious dives in Chicago,\r\nand also the \xe2\x80\x9cgray wolves\xe2\x80\x9d of the city council, who gave away the\r\nstreets of the city to the business men; and those who patronized their\r\nplaces were the gamblers and prize fighters who set the law at\r\ndefiance, and the burglars and holdup men who kept the whole city in\r\nterror. On election day all these powers of vice and crime were one\r\npower; they could tell within one per cent what the vote of their\r\ndistrict would be, and they could change it at an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\nA month ago Jurgis had all but perished of starvation upon the streets;\r\nand now suddenly, as by the gift of a magic key, he had entered into a\r\nworld where money and all the good things of life came freely. He was\r\nintroduced by his friend to an Irishman named \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d Halloran, who was\r\na political \xe2\x80\x9cworker\xe2\x80\x9d and on the inside of things. This man talked with\r\nJurgis for a while, and then told him that he had a little plan by\r\nwhich a man who looked like a workingman might make some easy money;\r\nbut it was a private affair, and had to be kept quiet. Jurgis expressed\r\nhimself as agreeable, and the other took him that afternoon (it was\r\nSaturday) to a place where city laborers were being paid off. The\r\npaymaster sat in a little booth, with a pile of envelopes before him,\r\nand two policemen standing by. Jurgis went, according to directions,\r\nand gave the name of \xe2\x80\x9cMichael O\xe2\x80\x99Flaherty,\xe2\x80\x9d and received an envelope,\r\nwhich he took around the corner and delivered to Halloran, who was\r\nwaiting for him in a saloon. Then he went again; and gave the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohann Schmidt,\xe2\x80\x9d and a third time, and give the name of \xe2\x80\x9cSerge\r\nReminitsky.\xe2\x80\x9d Halloran had quite a list of imaginary workingmen, and\r\nJurgis got an envelope for each one. For this work he received five\r\ndollars, and was told that he might have it every week, so long as he\r\nkept quiet. As Jurgis was excellent at keeping quiet, he soon won the\r\ntrust of \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d Halloran, and was introduced to others as a man who\r\ncould be depended upon.\r\n\r\nThis acquaintance was useful to him in another way, also before long\r\nJurgis made his discovery of the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cpull,\xe2\x80\x9d and just why his\r\nboss, Connor, and also the pugilist bartender, had been able to send\r\nhim to jail. One night there was given a ball, the \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne-eyed Larry,\xe2\x80\x9d a lame man who played the violin in one of the big\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chigh-class\xe2\x80\x9d houses of prostitution on Clark Street, and was a wag and\r\na popular character on the \xe2\x80\x9cL\xc3\xaav\xc3\xa9e.\xe2\x80\x9d This ball was held in a big dance\r\nhall, and was one of the occasions when the city\xe2\x80\x99s powers of debauchery\r\ngave themselves up to madness. Jurgis attended and got half insane with\r\ndrink, and began quarreling over a girl; his arm was pretty strong by\r\nthen, and he set to work to clean out the place, and ended in a cell in\r\nthe police station. The police station being crowded to the doors, and\r\nstinking with \xe2\x80\x9cbums,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis did not relish staying there to sleep off\r\nhis liquor, and sent for Halloran, who called up the district leader\r\nand had Jurgis bailed out by telephone at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\nWhen he was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had\r\nalready seen the clerk of the court and explained that Jurgis Rudkus\r\nwas a decent fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so Jurgis was fined\r\nten dollars and the fine was \xe2\x80\x9csuspended\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which meant that he did not\r\nhave to pay for it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody\r\nchose to bring it up against him in the future.\r\n\r\nAmong the people Jurgis lived with now money was valued according to an\r\nentirely different standard from that of the people of Packingtown;\r\nyet, strange as it may seem, he did a great deal less drinking than he\r\nhad as a workingman. He had not the same provocations of exhaustion and\r\nhopelessness; he had now something to work for, to struggle for. He\r\nsoon found that if he kept his wits about him, he would come upon new\r\nopportunities; and being naturally an active man, he not only kept\r\nsober himself, but helped to steady his friend, who was a good deal\r\nfonder of both wine and women than he.\r\n\r\nOne thing led to another. In the saloon where Jurgis met \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHalloran he was sitting late one night with Duane, when a \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\r\ncustomer\xe2\x80\x9d (a buyer for an out-of-town merchant) came in, a little more\r\nthan half \xe2\x80\x9cpiped.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no one else in the place but the\r\nbartender, and as the man went out again Jurgis and Duane followed him;\r\nhe went round the corner, and in a dark place made by a combination of\r\nthe elevated railroad and an unrented building, Jurgis leaped forward\r\nand shoved a revolver under his nose, while Duane, with his hat pulled\r\nover his eyes, went through the man\xe2\x80\x99s pockets with lightning fingers.\r\nThey got his watch and his \xe2\x80\x9cwad,\xe2\x80\x9d and were round the corner again and\r\ninto the saloon before he could shout more than once. The bartender, to\r\nwhom they had tipped the wink, had the cellar door open for them, and\r\nthey vanished, making their way by a secret entrance to a brothel next\r\ndoor. From the roof of this there was access to three similar places\r\nbeyond. By means of these passages the customers of any one place could\r\nbe gotten out of the way, in case a falling out with the police chanced\r\nto lead to a raid; and also it was necessary to have a way of getting a\r\ngirl out of reach in case of an emergency. Thousands of them came to\r\nChicago answering advertisements for \xe2\x80\x9cservants\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfactory hands,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand found themselves trapped by fake employment agencies, and locked up\r\nin a bawdy-house. It was generally enough to take all their clothes\r\naway from them; but sometimes they would have to be \xe2\x80\x9cdoped\xe2\x80\x9d and kept\r\nprisoners for weeks; and meantime their parents might be telegraphing\r\nthe police, and even coming on to see why nothing was done.\r\nOccasionally there was no way of satisfying them but to let them search\r\nthe place to which the girl had been traced.\r\n\r\nFor his help in this little job, the bartender received twenty out of\r\nthe hundred and thirty odd dollars that the pair secured; and naturally\r\nthis put them on friendly terms with him, and a few days later he\r\nintroduced them to a little \xe2\x80\x9csheeny\xe2\x80\x9d named Goldberger, one of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crunners\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9csporting house\xe2\x80\x9d where they had been hidden. After a\r\nfew drinks Goldberger began, with some hesitation, to narrate how he\r\nhad had a quarrel over his best girl with a professional \xe2\x80\x9ccardsharp,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwho had hit him in the jaw. The fellow was a stranger in Chicago, and\r\nif he was found some night with his head cracked there would be no one\r\nto care very much. Jurgis, who by this time would cheerfully have\r\ncracked the heads of all the gamblers in Chicago, inquired what would\r\nbe coming to him; at which the Jew became still more confidential, and\r\nsaid that he had some tips on the New Orleans races, which he got\r\ndirect from the police captain of the district, whom he had got out of\r\na bad scrape, and who \xe2\x80\x9cstood in\xe2\x80\x9d with a big syndicate of horse owners.\r\nDuane took all this in at once, but Jurgis had to have the whole\r\nrace-track situation explained to him before he realized the importance\r\nof such an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere was the gigantic Racing Trust. It owned the legislatures in every\r\nstate in which it did business; it even owned some of the big\r\nnewspapers, and made public opinion\xe2\x80\x94there was no power in the land that\r\ncould oppose it unless, perhaps, it were the Poolroom Trust. It built\r\nmagnificent racing parks all over the country, and by means of enormous\r\npurses it lured the people to come, and then it organized a gigantic\r\nshell game, whereby it plundered them of hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars every year. Horse racing had once been a sport, but nowadays it\r\nwas a business; a horse could be \xe2\x80\x9cdoped\xe2\x80\x9d and doctored, undertrained or\r\novertrained; it could be made to fall at any moment\xe2\x80\x94or its gait could\r\nbe broken by lashing it with the whip, which all the spectators would\r\ntake to be a desperate effort to keep it in the lead. There were scores\r\nof such tricks; and sometimes it was the owners who played them and\r\nmade fortunes, sometimes it was the jockeys and trainers, sometimes it\r\nwas outsiders, who bribed them\xe2\x80\x94but most of the time it was the chiefs\r\nof the trust. Now for instance, they were having winter racing in New\r\nOrleans and a syndicate was laying out each day\xe2\x80\x99s program in advance,\r\nand its agents in all the Northern cities were \xe2\x80\x9cmilking\xe2\x80\x9d the poolrooms.\r\nThe word came by long-distance telephone in a cipher code, just a\r\nlittle while before each race; and any man who could get the secret had\r\nas good as a fortune. If Jurgis did not believe it, he could try it,\r\nsaid the little Jew\xe2\x80\x94let them meet at a certain house on the morrow and\r\nmake a test. Jurgis was willing, and so was Duane, and so they went to\r\none of the high-class poolrooms where brokers and merchants gambled\r\n(with society women in a private room), and they put up ten dollars\r\neach upon a horse called \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Beldame,\xe2\x80\x9d a six to one shot, and won.\r\nFor a secret like that they would have done a good many sluggings\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthe next day Goldberger informed them that the offending gambler had\r\ngot wind of what was coming to him, and had skipped the town.\r\n\r\nThere were ups and downs at the business; but there was always a\r\nliving, inside of a jail, if not out of it. Early in April the city\r\nelections were due, and that meant prosperity for all the powers of\r\ngraft. Jurgis, hanging round in dives and gambling houses and brothels,\r\nmet with the heelers of both parties, and from their conversation he\r\ncame to understand all the ins and outs of the game, and to hear of a\r\nnumber of ways in which he could make himself useful about election\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d Halloran was a \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrat,\xe2\x80\x9d and so Jurgis became a Democrat\r\nalso; but he was not a bitter one\xe2\x80\x94the Republicans were good fellows,\r\ntoo, and were to have a pile of money in this next campaign. At the\r\nlast election the Republicans had paid four dollars a vote to the\r\nDemocrats\xe2\x80\x99 three; and \xe2\x80\x9cBuck\xe2\x80\x9d Halloran sat one night playing cards with\r\nJurgis and another man, who told how Halloran had been charged with the\r\njob voting a \xe2\x80\x9cbunch\xe2\x80\x9d of thirty-seven newly landed Italians, and how he,\r\nthe narrator, had met the Republican worker who was after the very same\r\ngang, and how the three had effected a bargain, whereby the Italians\r\nwere to vote half and half, for a glass of beer apiece, while the\r\nbalance of the fund went to the conspirators!\r\n\r\nNot long after this, Jurgis, wearying of the risks and vicissitudes of\r\nmiscellaneous crime, was moved to give up the career for that of a\r\npolitician. Just at this time there was a tremendous uproar being\r\nraised concerning the alliance between the criminals and the police.\r\nFor the criminal graft was one in which the business men had no direct\r\npart\xe2\x80\x94it was what is called a \xe2\x80\x9cside line,\xe2\x80\x9d carried by the police. \xe2\x80\x9cWide\r\nopen\xe2\x80\x9d gambling and debauchery made the city pleasing to \xe2\x80\x9ctrade,\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nburglaries and holdups did not. One night it chanced that while Jack\r\nDuane was drilling a safe in a clothing store he was caught red-handed\r\nby the night watchman, and turned over to a policeman, who chanced to\r\nknow him well, and who took the responsibility of letting him make his\r\nescape. Such a howl from the newspapers followed this that Duane was\r\nslated for sacrifice, and barely got out of town in time. And just at\r\nthat juncture it happened that Jurgis was introduced to a man named\r\nHarper whom he recognized as the night watchman at Brown\xe2\x80\x99s, who had\r\nbeen instrumental in making him an American citizen, the first year of\r\nhis arrival at the yards. The other was interested in the coincidence,\r\nbut did not remember Jurgis\xe2\x80\x94he had handled too many \xe2\x80\x9cgreen ones\xe2\x80\x9d in his\r\ntime, he said. He sat in a dance hall with Jurgis and Halloran until\r\none or two in the morning, exchanging experiences. He had a long story\r\nto tell of his quarrel with the superintendent of his department, and\r\nhow he was now a plain workingman, and a good union man as well. It was\r\nnot until some months afterward that Jurgis understood that the quarrel\r\nwith the superintendent had been prearranged, and that Harper was in\r\nreality drawing a salary of twenty dollars a week from the packers for\r\nan inside report of his union\xe2\x80\x99s secret proceedings. The yards were\r\nseething with agitation just then, said the man, speaking as a\r\nunionist. The people of Packingtown had borne about all that they would\r\nbear, and it looked as if a strike might begin any week.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk the man made inquiries concerning Jurgis, and a couple\r\nof days later he came to him with an interesting proposition. He was\r\nnot absolutely certain, he said, but he thought that he could get him a\r\nregular salary if he would come to Packingtown and do as he was told,\r\nand keep his mouth shut. Harper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBush\xe2\x80\x9d Harper, he was called\xe2\x80\x94was a\r\nright-hand man of Mike Scully, the Democratic boss of the stockyards;\r\nand in the coming election there was a peculiar situation. There had\r\ncome to Scully a proposition to nominate a certain rich brewer who\r\nlived upon a swell boulevard that skirted the district, and who coveted\r\nthe big badge and the \xe2\x80\x9chonorable\xe2\x80\x9d of an alderman. The brewer was a Jew,\r\nand had no brains, but he was harmless, and would put up a rare\r\ncampaign fund. Scully had accepted the offer, and then gone to the\r\nRepublicans with a proposition. He was not sure that he could manage\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9csheeny,\xe2\x80\x9d and he did not mean to take any chances with his\r\ndistrict; let the Republicans nominate a certain obscure but amiable\r\nfriend of Scully\xe2\x80\x99s, who was now setting tenpins in the cellar of an\r\nAshland Avenue saloon, and he, Scully, would elect him with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csheeny\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d money, and the Republicans might have the glory, which was\r\nmore than they would get otherwise. In return for this the Republicans\r\nwould agree to put up no candidate the following year, when Scully\r\nhimself came up for reelection as the other alderman from the ward. To\r\nthis the Republicans had assented at once; but the hell of it was\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nHarper explained\xe2\x80\x94that the Republicans were all of them fools\xe2\x80\x94a man had\r\nto be a fool to be a Republican in the stockyards, where Scully was\r\nking. And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to work, and of course it would not do\r\nfor the Democratic workers, the noble redskins of the War Whoop League,\r\nto support the Republican openly. The difficulty would not have been so\r\ngreat except for another fact\xe2\x80\x94there had been a curious development in\r\nstockyards politics in the last year or two, a new party having leaped\r\ninto being. They were the Socialists; and it was a devil of a mess,\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cBush\xe2\x80\x9d Harper. The one image which the word \xe2\x80\x9cSocialist\xe2\x80\x9d brought to\r\nJurgis was of poor little Tamoszius Kuszleika, who had called himself\r\none, and would go out with a couple of other men and a soap-box, and\r\nshout himself hoarse on a street corner Saturday nights. Tamoszius had\r\ntried to explain to Jurgis what it was all about, but Jurgis, who was\r\nnot of an imaginative turn, had never quite got it straight; at present\r\nhe was content with his companion\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that the Socialists\r\nwere the enemies of American institutions\xe2\x80\x94could not be bought, and\r\nwould not combine or make any sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cdicker.\xe2\x80\x9d Mike Scully was very\r\nmuch worried over the opportunity which his last deal gave to them\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstockyards Democrats were furious at the idea of a rich capitalist for\r\ntheir candidate, and while they were changing they might possibly\r\nconclude that a Socialist firebrand was preferable to a Republican bum.\r\nAnd so right here was a chance for Jurgis to make himself a place in\r\nthe world, explained \xe2\x80\x9cBush\xe2\x80\x9d Harper; he had been a union man, and he was\r\nknown in the yards as a workingman; he must have hundreds of\r\nacquaintances, and as he had never talked politics with them he might\r\ncome out as a Republican now without exciting the least suspicion.\r\nThere were barrels of money for the use of those who could deliver the\r\ngoods; and Jurgis might count upon Mike Scully, who had never yet gone\r\nback on a friend. Just what could he do? Jurgis asked, in some\r\nperplexity, and the other explained in detail. To begin with, he would\r\nhave to go to the yards and work, and he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t relish that; but he\r\nwould have what he earned, as well as the rest that came to him. He\r\nwould get active in the union again, and perhaps try to get an office,\r\nas he, Harper, had; he would tell all his friends the good points of\r\nDoyle, the Republican nominee, and the bad ones of the \xe2\x80\x9csheeny\xe2\x80\x9d; and\r\nthen Scully would furnish a meeting place, and he would start the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Men\xe2\x80\x99s Republican Association,\xe2\x80\x9d or something of that sort, and\r\nhave the rich brewer\xe2\x80\x99s best beer by the hogshead, and fireworks and\r\nspeeches, just like the War Whoop League. Surely Jurgis must know\r\nhundreds of men who would like that sort of fun; and there would be the\r\nregular Republican leaders and workers to help him out, and they would\r\ndeliver a big enough majority on election day.\r\n\r\nWhen he had heard all this explanation to the end, Jurgis demanded:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I get a job in Packingtown? I\xe2\x80\x99m blacklisted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt which \xe2\x80\x9cBush\xe2\x80\x9d Harper laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to that all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAnd the other replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a go, then; I\xe2\x80\x99m your man.\xe2\x80\x9d So Jurgis went\r\nout to the stockyards again, and was introduced to the political lord\r\nof the district, the boss of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s mayor. It was Scully who owned\r\nthe brick-yards and the dump and the ice pond\xe2\x80\x94though Jurgis did not\r\nknow it. It was Scully who was to blame for the unpaved street in which\r\nJurgis\xe2\x80\x99s child had been drowned; it was Scully who had put into office\r\nthe magistrate who had first sent Jurgis to jail; it was Scully who was\r\nprincipal stockholder in the company which had sold him the ramshackle\r\ntenement, and then robbed him of it. But Jurgis knew none of these\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94any more than he knew that Scully was but a tool and puppet of\r\nthe packers. To him Scully was a mighty power, the \xe2\x80\x9cbiggest\xe2\x80\x9d man he had\r\never met.\r\n\r\nHe was a little, dried-up Irishman, whose hands shook. He had a brief\r\ntalk with his visitor, watching him with his ratlike eyes, and making\r\nup his mind about him; and then he gave him a note to Mr. Harmon, one\r\nof the head managers of Durham\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bearer, Jurgis Rudkus, is a particular friend of mine, and I would\r\nlike you to find him a good place, for important reasons. He was once\r\nindiscreet, but you will perhaps be so good as to overlook that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Harmon looked up inquiringly when he read this. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he mean\r\nby \xe2\x80\x98indiscreet\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was blacklisted, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\nAt which the other frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cBlacklisted?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd Jurgis turned red with embarrassment.\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten that a blacklist did not exist. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94I had\r\ndifficulty in getting a place,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got into a quarrel with a foreman\xe2\x80\x94not my own boss, sir\xe2\x80\x94and struck\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, and meditated for a few moments. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nwish to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly I had a broken arm this winter, and\r\nso I have to be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would it suit you to be a night watchman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, sir. I have to be among the men at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94politics. Well, would it suit you to trim hogs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Harmon called a timekeeper and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake this man to Pat\r\nMurphy and tell him to find room for him somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis marched into the hog-killing room, a place where, in the\r\ndays gone by, he had come begging for a job. Now he walked jauntily,\r\nand smiled to himself, seeing the frown that came to the boss\xe2\x80\x99s face as\r\nthe timekeeper said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Harmon says to put this man on.\xe2\x80\x9d It would\r\novercrowd his department and spoil the record he was trying to make\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nhe said not a word except \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis became a workingman once more; and straightway he sought\r\nout his old friends, and joined the union, and began to \xe2\x80\x9croot\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScotty\xe2\x80\x9d Doyle. Doyle had done him a good turn once, he explained, and\r\nwas really a bully chap; Doyle was a workingman himself, and would\r\nrepresent the workingmen\xe2\x80\x94why did they want to vote for a millionaire\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csheeny,\xe2\x80\x9d and what the hell had Mike Scully ever done for them that\r\nthey should back his candidates all the time? And meantime Scully had\r\ngiven Jurgis a note to the Republican leader of the ward, and he had\r\ngone there and met the crowd he was to work with. Already they had\r\nhired a big hall, with some of the brewer\xe2\x80\x99s money, and every night\r\nJurgis brought in a dozen new members of the \xe2\x80\x9cDoyle Republican\r\nAssociation.\xe2\x80\x9d Pretty soon they had a grand opening night; and there was\r\na brass band, which marched through the streets, and fireworks and\r\nbombs and red lights in front of the hall; and there was an enormous\r\ncrowd, with two overflow meetings\xe2\x80\x94so that the pale and trembling\r\ncandidate had to recite three times over the little speech which one of\r\nScully\xe2\x80\x99s henchmen had written, and which he had been a month learning\r\nby heart. Best of all, the famous and eloquent Senator Spareshanks,\r\npresidential candidate, rode out in an automobile to discuss the sacred\r\nprivileges of American citizenship, and protection and prosperity for\r\nthe American workingman. His inspiriting address was quoted to the\r\nextent of half a column in all the morning newspapers, which also said\r\nthat it could be stated upon excellent authority that the unexpected\r\npopularity developed by Doyle, the Republican candidate for alderman,\r\nwas giving great anxiety to Mr. Scully, the chairman of the Democratic\r\nCity Committee.\r\n\r\nThe chairman was still more worried when the monster torchlight\r\nprocession came off, with the members of the Doyle Republican\r\nAssociation all in red capes and hats, and free beer for every voter in\r\nthe ward\xe2\x80\x94the best beer ever given away in a political campaign, as the\r\nwhole electorate testified. During this parade, and at innumerable\r\ncart-tail meetings as well, Jurgis labored tirelessly. He did not make\r\nany speeches\xe2\x80\x94there were lawyers and other experts for that\xe2\x80\x94but he\r\nhelped to manage things; distributing notices and posting placards and\r\nbringing out the crowds; and when the show was on he attended to the\r\nfireworks and the beer. Thus in the course of the campaign he handled\r\nmany hundreds of dollars of the Hebrew brewer\xe2\x80\x99s money, administering it\r\nwith na\xc3\xafve and touching fidelity. Toward the end, however, he learned\r\nthat he was regarded with hatred by the rest of the \xe2\x80\x9cboys,\xe2\x80\x9d because he\r\ncompelled them either to make a poorer showing than he or to do without\r\ntheir share of the pie. After that Jurgis did his best to please them,\r\nand to make up for the time he had lost before he discovered the extra\r\nbungholes of the campaign barrel.\r\n\r\nHe pleased Mike Scully, also. On election morning he was out at four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, \xe2\x80\x9cgetting out the vote\xe2\x80\x9d; he had a two-horse carriage to ride\r\nin, and he went from house to house for his friends, and escorted them\r\nin triumph to the polls. He voted half a dozen times himself, and voted\r\nsome of his friends as often; he brought bunch after bunch of the\r\nnewest foreigners\xe2\x80\x94Lithuanians, Poles, Bohemians, Slovaks\xe2\x80\x94and when he\r\nhad put them through the mill he turned them over to another man to\r\ntake to the next polling place. When Jurgis first set out, the captain\r\nof the precinct gave him a hundred dollars, and three times in the\r\ncourse of the day he came for another hundred, and not more than\r\ntwenty-five out of each lot got stuck in his own pocket. The balance\r\nall went for actual votes, and on a day of Democratic landslides they\r\nelected \xe2\x80\x9cScotty\xe2\x80\x9d Doyle, the ex-tenpin setter, by nearly a thousand\r\nplurality\xe2\x80\x94and beginning at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, and ending at\r\nthree the next morning, Jurgis treated himself to a most unholy and\r\nhorrible \xe2\x80\x9cjag.\xe2\x80\x9d Nearly every one else in Packingtown did the same,\r\nhowever, for there was universal exultation over this triumph of\r\npopular government, this crushing defeat of an arrogant plutocrat by\r\nthe power of the common people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the elections Jurgis stayed on in Packingtown and kept his job.\r\nThe agitation to break up the police protection of criminals was\r\ncontinuing, and it seemed to him best to \xe2\x80\x9clay low\xe2\x80\x9d for the present. He\r\nhad nearly three hundred dollars in the bank, and might have considered\r\nhimself entitled to a vacation; but he had an easy job, and force of\r\nhabit kept him at it. Besides, Mike Scully, whom he consulted, advised\r\nhim that something might \xe2\x80\x9cturn up\xe2\x80\x9d before long.\r\n\r\nJurgis got himself a place in a boardinghouse with some congenial\r\nfriends. He had already inquired of Aniele, and learned that Elzbieta\r\nand her family had gone downtown, and so he gave no further thought to\r\nthem. He went with a new set, now, young unmarried fellows who were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csporty.\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis had long ago cast off his fertilizer clothing, and\r\nsince going into politics he had donned a linen collar and a greasy red\r\nnecktie. He had some reason for thinking of his dress, for he was\r\nmaking about eleven dollars a week, and two-thirds of it he might spend\r\nupon his pleasures without ever touching his savings.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would ride down-town with a party of friends to the cheap\r\ntheaters and the music halls and other haunts with which they were\r\nfamiliar. Many of the saloons in Packingtown had pool tables, and some\r\nof them bowling alleys, by means of which he could spend his evenings\r\nin petty gambling. Also, there were cards and dice. One time Jurgis got\r\ninto a game on a Saturday night and won prodigiously, and because he\r\nwas a man of spirit he stayed in with the rest and the game continued\r\nuntil late Sunday afternoon, and by that time he was \xe2\x80\x9cout\xe2\x80\x9d over twenty\r\ndollars. On Saturday nights, also, a number of balls were generally\r\ngiven in Packingtown; each man would bring his \xe2\x80\x9cgirl\xe2\x80\x9d with him, paying\r\nhalf a dollar for a ticket, and several dollars additional for drinks\r\nin the course of the festivities, which continued until three or four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, unless broken up by fighting. During all this\r\ntime the same man and woman would dance together, half-stupefied with\r\nsensuality and drink.\r\n\r\nBefore long Jurgis discovered what Scully had meant by something\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cturning up.\xe2\x80\x9d In May the agreement between the packers and the unions\r\nexpired, and a new agreement had to be signed. Negotiations were going\r\non, and the yards were full of talk of a strike. The old scale had\r\ndealt with the wages of the skilled men only; and of the members of the\r\nMeat Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Union about two-thirds were unskilled men. In Chicago\r\nthese latter were receiving, for the most part, eighteen and a half\r\ncents an hour, and the unions wished to make this the general wage for\r\nthe next year. It was not nearly so large a wage as it seemed\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\ncourse of the negotiations the union officers examined time checks to\r\nthe amount of ten thousand dollars, and they found that the highest\r\nwages paid had been fourteen dollars a week, and the lowest two dollars\r\nand five cents, and the average of the whole, six dollars and\r\nsixty-five cents. And six dollars and sixty-five cents was hardly too\r\nmuch for a man to keep a family on, considering the fact that the price\r\nof dressed meat had increased nearly fifty per cent in the last five\r\nyears, while the price of \xe2\x80\x9cbeef on the hoof\xe2\x80\x9d had decreased as much, it\r\nwould have seemed that the packers ought to be able to pay it; but the\r\npackers were unwilling to pay it\xe2\x80\x94they rejected the union demand, and to\r\nshow what their purpose was, a week or two after the agreement expired\r\nthey put down the wages of about a thousand men to sixteen and a half\r\ncents, and it was said that old man Jones had vowed he would put them\r\nto fifteen before he got through. There were a million and a half of\r\nmen in the country looking for work, a hundred thousand of them right\r\nin Chicago; and were the packers to let the union stewards march into\r\ntheir places and bind them to a contract that would lose them several\r\nthousand dollars a day for a year? Not much!\r\n\r\nAll this was in June; and before long the question was submitted to a\r\nreferendum in the unions, and the decision was for a strike. It was the\r\nsame in all the packing house cities; and suddenly the newspapers and\r\npublic woke up to face the gruesome spectacle of a meat famine. All\r\nsorts of pleas for a reconsideration were made, but the packers were\r\nobdurate; and all the while they were reducing wages, and heading off\r\nshipments of cattle, and rushing in wagon-loads of mattresses and cots.\r\nSo the men boiled over, and one night telegrams went out from the union\r\nheadquarters to all the big packing centers\xe2\x80\x94to St. Paul, South Omaha,\r\nSioux City, St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis, and New York\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe next day at noon between fifty and sixty thousand men drew off\r\ntheir working clothes and marched out of the factories, and the great\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeef Strike\xe2\x80\x9d was on.\r\n\r\nJurgis went to his dinner, and afterward he walked over to see Mike\r\nScully, who lived in a fine house, upon a street which had been\r\ndecently paved and lighted for his especial benefit. Scully had gone\r\ninto semi-retirement, and looked nervous and worried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nwant?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, when he saw Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to see if maybe you could get me a place during the strike,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe other replied.\r\n\r\nAnd Scully knit his brows and eyed him narrowly. In that morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npapers Jurgis had read a fierce denunciation of the packers by Scully,\r\nwho had declared that if they did not treat their people better the\r\ncity authorities would end the matter by tearing down their plants.\r\nNow, therefore, Jurgis was not a little taken aback when the other\r\ndemanded suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Rudkus, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stick by your job?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis started. \xe2\x80\x9cWork as a scab?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Scully. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Jurgis. He had somehow taken it for granted that\r\nhe should go out with his union. \xe2\x80\x9cThe packers need good men, and need\r\nthem bad,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the other, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\xe2\x80\x99ll treat a man right that\r\nstands by them. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take your chance and fix yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9chow could I ever be of any use to you\xe2\x80\x94in\r\npolitics?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be it anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scully, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell, man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know you\xe2\x80\x99re a Republican? And\r\ndo you think I\xe2\x80\x99m always going to elect Republicans? My brewer has found\r\nout already how we served him, and there is the deuce to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis looked dumfounded. He had never thought of that aspect of it\r\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x9cI could be a Democrat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the other, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not right away; a man can\xe2\x80\x99t change his\r\npolitics every day. And besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need you\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99d be nothing\r\nfor you to do. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a long time to election day, anyhow; and what\r\nare you going to do meantime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I could count on you,\xe2\x80\x9d began Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Scully, \xe2\x80\x9cso you could\xe2\x80\x94I never yet went back on a\r\nfriend. But is it fair to leave the job I got you and come to me for\r\nanother? I have had a hundred fellows after me today, and what can I\r\ndo? I\xe2\x80\x99ve put seventeen men on the city payroll to clean streets this\r\none week, and do you think I can keep that up forever? It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nfor me to tell other men what I tell you, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the\r\ninside, and you ought to have sense enough to see for yourself. What\r\nhave you to gain by a strike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99d better. Take my word for it, the\r\nstrike will be over in a few days, and the men will be beaten; and\r\nmeantime what you can get out of it will belong to you. Do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jurgis saw. He went back to the yards, and into the workroom. The\r\nmen had left a long line of hogs in various stages of preparation, and\r\nthe foreman was directing the feeble efforts of a score or two of\r\nclerks and stenographers and office boys to finish up the job and get\r\nthem into the chilling rooms. Jurgis went straight up to him and\r\nannounced, \xe2\x80\x9cI have come back to work, Mr. Murphy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boss\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted up. \xe2\x80\x9cGood man!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cCome ahead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, checking his enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought\r\nto get a little more wages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cof course. What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis had debated on the way. His nerve almost failed him now, but he\r\nclenched his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought to have\xe2\x80\x99 three dollars a day,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, promptly; and before the day was out our\r\nfriend discovered that the clerks and stenographers and office boys\r\nwere getting five dollars a day, and then he could have kicked himself!\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis became one of the new \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican heroes,\xe2\x80\x9d a man whose virtues\r\nmerited comparison with those of the martyrs of Lexington and Valley\r\nForge. The resemblance was not complete, of course, for Jurgis was\r\ngenerously paid and comfortably clad, and was provided with a spring\r\ncot and a mattress and three substantial meals a day; also he was\r\nperfectly at ease, and safe from all peril of life and limb, save only\r\nin the case that a desire for beer should lead him to venture outside\r\nof the stockyards gates. And even in the exercise of this privilege he\r\nwas not left unprotected; a good part of the inadequate police force of\r\nChicago was suddenly diverted from its work of hunting criminals, and\r\nrushed out to serve him. The police, and the strikers also, were\r\ndetermined that there should be no violence; but there was another\r\nparty interested which was minded to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94and that was the\r\npress. On the first day of his life as a strikebreaker Jurgis quit work\r\nearly, and in a spirit of bravado he challenged three men of his\r\nacquaintance to go outside and get a drink. They accepted, and went\r\nthrough the big Halsted Street gate, where several policemen were\r\nwatching, and also some union pickets, scanning sharply those who\r\npassed in and out. Jurgis and his companions went south on Halsted\r\nStreet; past the hotel, and then suddenly half a dozen men started\r\nacross the street toward them and proceeded to argue with them\r\nconcerning the error of their ways. As the arguments were not taken in\r\nthe proper spirit, they went on to threats; and suddenly one of them\r\njerked off the hat of one of the four and flung it over the fence. The\r\nman started after it, and then, as a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cScab!\xe2\x80\x9d was raised and a\r\ndozen people came running out of saloons and doorways, a second man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart failed him and he followed. Jurgis and the fourth stayed long\r\nenough to give themselves the satisfaction of a quick exchange of\r\nblows, and then they, too, took to their heels and fled back of the\r\nhotel and into the yards again. Meantime, of course, policemen were\r\ncoming on a run, and as a crowd gathered other police got excited and\r\nsent in a riot call. Jurgis knew nothing of this, but went back to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPackers\xe2\x80\x99 Avenue,\xe2\x80\x9d and in front of the \xe2\x80\x9cCentral Time Station\xe2\x80\x9d he saw\r\none of his companions, breathless and wild with excitement, narrating\r\nto an ever growing throng how the four had been attacked and surrounded\r\nby a howling mob, and had been nearly torn to pieces. While he stood\r\nlistening, smiling cynically, several dapper young men stood by with\r\nnotebooks in their hands, and it was not more than two hours later that\r\nJurgis saw newsboys running about with armfuls of newspapers, printed\r\nin red and black letters six inches high:\r\n\r\nVIOLENCE IN THE YARDS! STRIKEBREAKERS SURROUNDED BY FRENZIED MOB!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf he had been able to buy all of the newspapers of the United States\r\nthe next morning, he might have discovered that his beer-hunting\r\nexploit was being perused by some two score millions of people, and had\r\nserved as a text for editorials in half the staid and solemn\r\nbusiness-men\xe2\x80\x99s newspapers in the land.\r\n\r\nJurgis was to see more of this as time passed. For the present, his\r\nwork being over, he was free to ride into the city, by a railroad\r\ndirect from the yards, or else to spend the night in a room where cots\r\nhad been laid in rows. He chose the latter, but to his regret, for all\r\nnight long gangs of strikebreakers kept arriving. As very few of the\r\nbetter class of workingmen could be got for such work, these specimens\r\nof the new American hero contained an assortment of the criminals and\r\nthugs of the city, besides Negroes and the lowest foreigners\xe2\x80\x94Greeks,\r\nRoumanians, Sicilians, and Slovaks. They had been attracted more by the\r\nprospect of disorder than by the big wages; and they made the night\r\nhideous with singing and carousing, and only went to sleep when the\r\ntime came for them to get up to work.\r\n\r\nIn the morning before Jurgis had finished his breakfast, \xe2\x80\x9cPat\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy\r\nordered him to one of the superintendents, who questioned him as to his\r\nexperience in the work of the killing room. His heart began to thump\r\nwith excitement, for he divined instantly that his hour had come\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nhe was to be a boss!\r\n\r\nSome of the foremen were union members, and many who were not had gone\r\nout with the men. It was in the killing department that the packers had\r\nbeen left most in the lurch, and precisely here that they could least\r\nafford it; the smoking and canning and salting of meat might wait, and\r\nall the by-products might be wasted\xe2\x80\x94but fresh meats must be had, or the\r\nrestaurants and hotels and brownstone houses would feel the pinch, and\r\nthen \xe2\x80\x9cpublic opinion\xe2\x80\x9d would take a startling turn.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity such as this would not come twice to a man; and Jurgis\r\nseized it. Yes, he knew the work, the whole of it, and he could teach\r\nit to others. But if he took the job and gave satisfaction he would\r\nexpect to keep it\xe2\x80\x94they would not turn him off at the end of the strike?\r\nTo which the superintendent replied that he might safely trust Durham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor that\xe2\x80\x94they proposed to teach these unions a lesson, and most of all\r\nthose foremen who had gone back on them. Jurgis would receive five\r\ndollars a day during the strike, and twenty-five a week after it was\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nSo our friend got a pair of \xe2\x80\x9cslaughter pen\xe2\x80\x9d boots and \xe2\x80\x9cjeans,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nflung himself at his task. It was a weird sight, there on the killing\r\nbeds\xe2\x80\x94a throng of stupid black Negroes, and foreigners who could not\r\nunderstand a word that was said to them, mixed with pale-faced,\r\nhollow-chested bookkeepers and clerks, half-fainting for the tropical\r\nheat and the sickening stench of fresh blood\xe2\x80\x94and all struggling to\r\ndress a dozen or two cattle in the same place where, twenty-four hours\r\nago, the old killing gang had been speeding, with their marvelous\r\nprecision, turning out four hundred carcasses every hour!\r\n\r\nThe Negroes and the \xe2\x80\x9ctoughs\xe2\x80\x9d from the L\xc3\xaav\xc3\xa9e did not want to work, and\r\nevery few minutes some of them would feel obliged to retire and\r\nrecuperate. In a couple of days Durham and Company had electric fans up\r\nto cool off the rooms for them, and even couches for them to rest on;\r\nand meantime they could go out and find a shady corner and take a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csnooze,\xe2\x80\x9d and as there was no place for any one in particular, and no\r\nsystem, it might be hours before their boss discovered them. As for the\r\npoor office employees, they did their best, moved to it by terror;\r\nthirty of them had been \xe2\x80\x9cfired\xe2\x80\x9d in a bunch that first morning for\r\nrefusing to serve, besides a number of women clerks and typewriters who\r\nhad declined to act as waitresses.\r\n\r\nIt was such a force as this that Jurgis had to organize. He did his\r\nbest, flying here and there, placing them in rows and showing them the\r\ntricks; he had never given an order in his life before, but he had\r\ntaken enough of them to know, and he soon fell into the spirit of it,\r\nand roared and stormed like any old stager. He had not the most\r\ntractable pupils, however. \xe2\x80\x9cSee hyar, boss,\xe2\x80\x9d a big black \xe2\x80\x9cbuck\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nbegin, \xe2\x80\x9cef you doan\xe2\x80\x99 like de way Ah does dis job, you kin get somebody\r\nelse to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then a crowd would gather and listen, muttering\r\nthreats. After the first meal nearly all the steel knives had been\r\nmissing, and now every Negro had one, ground to a fine point, hidden in\r\nhis boots.\r\n\r\nThere was no bringing order out of such a chaos, Jurgis soon\r\ndiscovered; and he fell in with the spirit of the thing\xe2\x80\x94there was no\r\nreason why he should wear himself out with shouting. If hides and guts\r\nwere slashed and rendered useless there was no way of tracing it to any\r\none; and if a man lay off and forgot to come back there was nothing to\r\nbe gained by seeking him, for all the rest would quit in the meantime.\r\nEverything went, during the strike, and the packers paid. Before long\r\nJurgis found that the custom of resting had suggested to some alert\r\nminds the possibility of registering at more than one place and earning\r\nmore than one five dollars a day. When he caught a man at this he\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfired\xe2\x80\x9d him, but it chanced to be in a quiet corner, and the man\r\ntendered him a ten-dollar bill and a wink, and he took them. Of course,\r\nbefore long this custom spread, and Jurgis was soon making quite a good\r\nincome from it.\r\n\r\nIn the face of handicaps such as these the packers counted themselves\r\nlucky if they could kill off the cattle that had been crippled in\r\ntransit and the hogs that had developed disease. Frequently, in the\r\ncourse of a two or three days\xe2\x80\x99 trip, in hot weather and without water,\r\nsome hog would develop cholera, and die; and the rest would attack him\r\nbefore he had ceased kicking, and when the car was opened there would\r\nbe nothing of him left but the bones. If all the hogs in this carload\r\nwere not killed at once, they would soon be down with the dread\r\ndisease, and there would be nothing to do but make them into lard. It\r\nwas the same with cattle that were gored and dying, or were limping\r\nwith broken bones stuck through their flesh\xe2\x80\x94they must be killed, even\r\nif brokers and buyers and superintendents had to take off their coats\r\nand help drive and cut and skin them. And meantime, agents of the\r\npackers were gathering gangs of Negroes in the country districts of the\r\nfar South, promising them five dollars a day and board, and being\r\ncareful not to mention there was a strike; already carloads of them\r\nwere on the way, with special rates from the railroads, and all traffic\r\nordered out of the way. Many towns and cities were taking advantage of\r\nthe chance to clear out their jails and workhouses\xe2\x80\x94in Detroit the\r\nmagistrates would release every man who agreed to leave town within\r\ntwenty-four hours, and agents of the packers were in the courtrooms to\r\nship them right. And meantime trainloads of supplies were coming in for\r\ntheir accommodation, including beer and whisky, so that they might not\r\nbe tempted to go outside. They hired thirty young girls in Cincinnati\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cpack fruit,\xe2\x80\x9d and when they arrived put them at work canning corned\r\nbeef, and put cots for them to sleep in a public hallway, through which\r\nthe men passed. As the gangs came in day and night, under the escort of\r\nsquads of police, they stowed away in unused workrooms and storerooms,\r\nand in the car sheds, crowded so closely together that the cots\r\ntouched. In some places they would use the same room for eating and\r\nsleeping, and at night the men would put their cots upon the tables, to\r\nkeep away from the swarms of rats.\r\n\r\nBut with all their best efforts, the packers were demoralized. Ninety\r\nper cent of the men had walked out; and they faced the task of\r\ncompletely remaking their labor force\xe2\x80\x94and with the price of meat up\r\nthirty per cent, and the public clamoring for a settlement. They made\r\nan offer to submit the whole question at issue to arbitration; and at\r\nthe end of ten days the unions accepted it, and the strike was called\r\noff. It was agreed that all the men were to be re-employed within\r\nforty-five days, and that there was to be \xe2\x80\x9cno discrimination against\r\nunion men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an anxious time for Jurgis. If the men were taken back\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwithout discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d he would lose his present place. He sought\r\nout the superintendent, who smiled grimly and bade him \xe2\x80\x9cwait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDurham\xe2\x80\x99s strikebreakers were few of them leaving.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the \xe2\x80\x9csettlement\xe2\x80\x9d was simply a trick of the packers to\r\ngain time, or whether they really expected to break the strike and\r\ncripple the unions by the plan, cannot be said; but that night there\r\nwent out from the office of Durham and Company a telegram to all the\r\nbig packing centers, \xe2\x80\x9cEmploy no union leaders.\xe2\x80\x9d And in the morning,\r\nwhen the twenty thousand men thronged into the yards, with their dinner\r\npails and working clothes, Jurgis stood near the door of the\r\nhog-trimming room, where he had worked before the strike, and saw a\r\nthrong of eager men, with a score or two of policemen watching them;\r\nand he saw a superintendent come out and walk down the line, and pick\r\nout man after man that pleased him; and one after another came, and\r\nthere were some men up near the head of the line who were never\r\npicked\xe2\x80\x94they being the union stewards and delegates, and the men Jurgis\r\nhad heard making speeches at the meetings. Each time, of course, there\r\nwere louder murmurings and angrier looks. Over where the cattle\r\nbutchers were waiting, Jurgis heard shouts and saw a crowd, and he\r\nhurried there. One big butcher, who was president of the Packing Trades\r\nCouncil, had been passed over five times, and the men were wild with\r\nrage; they had appointed a committee of three to go in and see the\r\nsuperintendent, and the committee had made three attempts, and each\r\ntime the police had clubbed them back from the door. Then there were\r\nyells and hoots, continuing until at last the superintendent came to\r\nthe door. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all go back or none of us do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a hundred voices.\r\nAnd the other shook his fist at them, and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou went out of\r\nhere like cattle, and like cattle you\xe2\x80\x99ll come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the big butcher president leaped upon a pile of stones\r\nand yelled: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s off, boys. We\xe2\x80\x99ll all of us quit again!\xe2\x80\x9d And so the\r\ncattle butchers declared a new strike on the spot; and gathering their\r\nmembers from the other plants, where the same trick had been played,\r\nthey marched down Packers\xe2\x80\x99 Avenue, which was thronged with a dense mass\r\nof workers, cheering wildly. Men who had already got to work on the\r\nkilling beds dropped their tools and joined them; some galloped here\r\nand there on horseback, shouting the tidings, and within half an hour\r\nthe whole of Packingtown was on strike again, and beside itself with\r\nfury.\r\n\r\nThere was quite a different tone in Packingtown after this\xe2\x80\x94the place\r\nwas a seething caldron of passion, and the \xe2\x80\x9cscab\xe2\x80\x9d who ventured into it\r\nfared badly. There were one or two of these incidents each day, the\r\nnewspapers detailing them, and always blaming them upon the unions. Yet\r\nten years before, when there were no unions in Packingtown, there was a\r\nstrike, and national troops had to be called, and there were pitched\r\nbattles fought at night, by the light of blazing freight trains.\r\nPackingtown was always a center of violence; in \xe2\x80\x9cWhisky Point,\xe2\x80\x9d where\r\nthere were a hundred saloons and one glue factory, there was always\r\nfighting, and always more of it in hot weather. Any one who had taken\r\nthe trouble to consult the station house blotter would have found that\r\nthere was less violence that summer than ever before\xe2\x80\x94and this while\r\ntwenty thousand men were out of work, and with nothing to do all day\r\nbut brood upon bitter wrongs. There was no one to picture the battle\r\nthe union leaders were fighting\xe2\x80\x94to hold this huge army in rank, to keep\r\nit from straggling and pillaging, to cheer and encourage and guide a\r\nhundred thousand people, of a dozen different tongues, through six long\r\nweeks of hunger and disappointment and despair.\r\n\r\nMeantime the packers had set themselves definitely to the task of\r\nmaking a new labor force. A thousand or two of strikebreakers were\r\nbrought in every night, and distributed among the various plants. Some\r\nof them were experienced workers,\xe2\x80\x94butchers, salesmen, and managers from\r\nthe packers\xe2\x80\x99 branch stores, and a few union men who had deserted from\r\nother cities; but the vast majority were \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d Negroes from the\r\ncotton districts of the far South, and they were herded into the\r\npacking plants like sheep. There was a law forbidding the use of\r\nbuildings as lodginghouses unless they were licensed for the purpose,\r\nand provided with proper windows, stairways, and fire escapes; but\r\nhere, in a \xe2\x80\x9cpaint room,\xe2\x80\x9d reached only by an enclosed \xe2\x80\x9cchute,\xe2\x80\x9d a room\r\nwithout a single window and only one door, a hundred men were crowded\r\nupon mattresses on the floor. Up on the third story of the \xe2\x80\x9chog house\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nof Jones\xe2\x80\x99s was a storeroom, without a window, into which they crowded\r\nseven hundred men, sleeping upon the bare springs of cots, and with a\r\nsecond shift to use them by day. And when the clamor of the public led\r\nto an investigation into these conditions, and the mayor of the city\r\nwas forced to order the enforcement of the law, the packers got a judge\r\nto issue an injunction forbidding him to do it!\r\n\r\nJust at this time the mayor was boasting that he had put an end to\r\ngambling and prize fighting in the city; but here a swarm of\r\nprofessional gamblers had leagued themselves with the police to fleece\r\nthe strikebreakers; and any night, in the big open space in front of\r\nBrown\xe2\x80\x99s, one might see brawny Negroes stripped to the waist and\r\npounding each other for money, while a howling throng of three or four\r\nthousand surged about, men and women, young white girls from the\r\ncountry rubbing elbows with big buck Negroes with daggers in their\r\nboots, while rows of woolly heads peered down from every window of the\r\nsurrounding factories. The ancestors of these black people had been\r\nsavages in Africa; and since then they had been chattel slaves, or had\r\nbeen held down by a community ruled by the traditions of slavery. Now\r\nfor the first time they were free\xe2\x80\x94free to gratify every passion, free\r\nto wreck themselves. They were wanted to break a strike, and when it\r\nwas broken they would be shipped away, and their present masters would\r\nnever see them again; and so whisky and women were brought in by the\r\ncarload and sold to them, and hell was let loose in the yards. Every\r\nnight there were stabbings and shootings; it was said that the packers\r\nhad blank permits, which enabled them to ship dead bodies from the city\r\nwithout troubling the authorities. They lodged men and women on the\r\nsame floor; and with the night there began a saturnalia of\r\ndebauchery\xe2\x80\x94scenes such as never before had been witnessed in America.\r\nAnd as the women were the dregs from the brothels of Chicago, and the\r\nmen were for the most part ignorant country Negroes, the nameless\r\ndiseases of vice were soon rife; and this where food was being handled\r\nwhich was sent out to every corner of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cUnion Stockyards\xe2\x80\x9d were never a pleasant place; but now they were\r\nnot only a collection of slaughterhouses, but also the camping place of\r\nan army of fifteen or twenty thousand human beasts. All day long the\r\nblazing midsummer sun beat down upon that square mile of abominations:\r\nupon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors\r\nstank and steamed contagion; upon bare, blistering, cinder-strewn\r\nrailroad tracks, and huge blocks of dingy meat factories, whose\r\nlabyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them;\r\nand there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of moist\r\nflesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and\r\nfertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell\xe2\x80\x94there were also\r\ntons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the\r\nworkers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black\r\nwith flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers.\r\n\r\nAnd then at night, when this throng poured out into the streets to\r\nplay\xe2\x80\x94fighting, gambling, drinking and carousing, cursing and screaming,\r\nlaughing and singing, playing banjoes and dancing! They were worked in\r\nthe yards all the seven days of the week, and they had their prize\r\nfights and crap games on Sunday nights as well; but then around the\r\ncorner one might see a bonfire blazing, and an old, gray-headed\r\nNegress, lean and witchlike, her hair flying wild and her eyes blazing,\r\nyelling and chanting of the fires of perdition and the blood of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLamb,\xe2\x80\x9d while men and women lay down upon the ground and moaned and\r\nscreamed in convulsions of terror and remorse.\r\n\r\nSuch were the stockyards during the strike; while the unions watched in\r\nsullen despair, and the country clamored like a greedy child for its\r\nfood, and the packers went grimly on their way. Each day they added new\r\nworkers, and could be more stern with the old ones\xe2\x80\x94could put them on\r\npiecework, and dismiss them if they did not keep up the pace. Jurgis\r\nwas now one of their agents in this process; and he could feel the\r\nchange day by day, like the slow starting up of a huge machine. He had\r\ngotten used to being a master of men; and because of the stifling heat\r\nand the stench, and the fact that he was a \xe2\x80\x9cscab\xe2\x80\x9d and knew it and\r\ndespised himself. He was drinking, and developing a villainous temper,\r\nand he stormed and cursed and raged at his men, and drove them until\r\nthey were ready to drop with exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThen one day late in August, a superintendent ran into the place and\r\nshouted to Jurgis and his gang to drop their work and come. They\r\nfollowed him outside, to where, in the midst of a dense throng, they\r\nsaw several two-horse trucks waiting, and three patrol-wagon loads of\r\npolice. Jurgis and his men sprang upon one of the trucks, and the\r\ndriver yelled to the crowd, and they went thundering away at a gallop.\r\nSome steers had just escaped from the yards, and the strikers had got\r\nhold of them, and there would be the chance of a scrap!\r\n\r\nThey went out at the Ashland Avenue gate, and over in the direction of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cdump.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a yell as soon as they were sighted, men and\r\nwomen rushing out of houses and saloons as they galloped by. There were\r\neight or ten policemen on the truck, however, and there was no\r\ndisturbance until they came to a place where the street was blocked\r\nwith a dense throng. Those on the flying truck yelled a warning and the\r\ncrowd scattered pell-mell, disclosing one of the steers lying in its\r\nblood. There were a good many cattle butchers about just then, with\r\nnothing much to do, and hungry children at home; and so some one had\r\nknocked out the steer\xe2\x80\x94and as a first-class man can kill and dress one\r\nin a couple of minutes, there were a good many steaks and roasts\r\nalready missing. This called for punishment, of course; and the police\r\nproceeded to administer it by leaping from the truck and cracking at\r\nevery head they saw. There were yells of rage and pain, and the\r\nterrified people fled into houses and stores, or scattered\r\nhelter-skelter down the street. Jurgis and his gang joined in the\r\nsport, every man singling out his victim, and striving to bring him to\r\nbay and punch him. If he fled into a house his pursuer would smash in\r\nthe flimsy door and follow him up the stairs, hitting every one who\r\ncame within reach, and finally dragging his squealing quarry from under\r\na bed or a pile of old clothes in a closet.\r\n\r\nJurgis and two policemen chased some men into a bar-room. One of them\r\ntook shelter behind the bar, where a policeman cornered him and\r\nproceeded to whack him over the back and shoulders, until he lay down\r\nand gave a chance at his head. The others leaped a fence in the rear,\r\nbalking the second policeman, who was fat; and as he came back, furious\r\nand cursing, a big Polish woman, the owner of the saloon, rushed in\r\nscreaming, and received a poke in the stomach that doubled her up on\r\nthe floor. Meantime Jurgis, who was of a practical temper, was helping\r\nhimself at the bar; and the first policeman, who had laid out his man,\r\njoined him, handing out several more bottles, and filling his pockets\r\nbesides, and then, as he started to leave, cleaning off all the balance\r\nwith a sweep of his club. The din of the glass crashing to the floor\r\nbrought the fat Polish woman to her feet again, but another policeman\r\ncame up behind her and put his knee into her back and his hands over\r\nher eyes\xe2\x80\x94and then called to his companion, who went back and broke open\r\nthe cash drawer and filled his pockets with the contents. Then the\r\nthree went outside, and the man who was holding the woman gave her a\r\nshove and dashed out himself. The gang having already got the carcass\r\non to the truck, the party set out at a trot, followed by screams and\r\ncurses, and a shower of bricks and stones from unseen enemies. These\r\nbricks and stones would figure in the accounts of the \xe2\x80\x9criot\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nwould be sent out to a few thousand newspapers within an hour or two;\r\nbut the episode of the cash drawer would never be mentioned again, save\r\nonly in the heartbreaking legends of Packingtown.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when they got back, and they dressed out\r\nthe remainder of the steer, and a couple of others that had been\r\nkilled, and then knocked off for the day. Jurgis went downtown to\r\nsupper, with three friends who had been on the other trucks, and they\r\nexchanged reminiscences on the way. Afterward they drifted into a\r\nroulette parlor, and Jurgis, who was never lucky at gambling, dropped\r\nabout fifteen dollars. To console himself he had to drink a good deal,\r\nand he went back to Packingtown about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, very\r\nmuch the worse for his excursion, and, it must be confessed, entirely\r\ndeserving the calamity that was in store for him.\r\n\r\nAs he was going to the place where he slept, he met a painted-cheeked\r\nwoman in a greasy \xe2\x80\x9ckimono,\xe2\x80\x9d and she put her arm about his waist to\r\nsteady him; they turned into a dark room they were passing\xe2\x80\x94but scarcely\r\nhad they taken two steps before suddenly a door swung open, and a man\r\nentered, carrying a lantern. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d he called sharply. And\r\nJurgis started to mutter some reply; but at the same instant the man\r\nraised his light, which flashed in his face, so that it was possible to\r\nrecognize him. Jurgis stood stricken dumb, and his heart gave a leap\r\nlike a mad thing. The man was Connor!\r\n\r\nConnor, the boss of the loading gang! The man who had seduced his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94who had sent him to prison, and wrecked his home, ruined his life!\r\nHe stood there, staring, with the light shining full upon him.\r\n\r\nJurgis had often thought of Connor since coming back to Packingtown,\r\nbut it had been as of something far off, that no longer concerned him.\r\nNow, however, when he saw him, alive and in the flesh, the same thing\r\nhappened to him that had happened before\xe2\x80\x94a flood of rage boiled up in\r\nhim, a blind frenzy seized him. And he flung himself at the man, and\r\nsmote him between the eyes\xe2\x80\x94and then, as he fell, seized him by the\r\nthroat and began to pound his head upon the stones.\r\n\r\nThe woman began screaming, and people came rushing in. The lantern had\r\nbeen upset and extinguished, and it was so dark they could not see a\r\nthing; but they could hear Jurgis panting, and hear the thumping of his\r\nvictim\xe2\x80\x99s skull, and they rushed there and tried to pull him off.\r\nPrecisely as before, Jurgis came away with a piece of his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s flesh\r\nbetween his teeth; and, as before, he went on fighting with those who\r\nhad interfered with him, until a policeman had come and beaten him into\r\ninsensibility.\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis spent the balance of the night in the stockyards station\r\nhouse. This time, however, he had money in his pocket, and when he came\r\nto his senses he could get something to drink, and also a messenger to\r\ntake word of his plight to \xe2\x80\x9cBush\xe2\x80\x9d Harper. Harper did not appear,\r\nhowever, until after the prisoner, feeling very weak and ill, had been\r\nhailed into court and remanded at five hundred dollars\xe2\x80\x99 bail to await\r\nthe result of his victim\xe2\x80\x99s injuries. Jurgis was wild about this,\r\nbecause a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench, and he\r\nhad stated that he had never been arrested before, and also that he had\r\nbeen attacked first\xe2\x80\x94and if only someone had been there to speak a good\r\nword for him, he could have been let off at once.\r\n\r\nBut Harper explained that he had been downtown, and had not got the\r\nmessage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a fellow up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get five\r\nhundred dollars\xe2\x80\x99 bail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can arrange that all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthough it may cost you\r\na few dollars, of course. But what was the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a man that did me a mean trick once,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a foreman in Brown\xe2\x80\x99s or used to be. His name\xe2\x80\x99s Connor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the other gave a start. \xe2\x80\x9cConnor!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cNot Phil Connor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the fellow. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthen you\xe2\x80\x99re in for it, old man! _I_\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot help me! Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of Scully\xe2\x80\x99s biggest men\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a member of the War-Whoop\r\nLeague, and they talked of sending him to the legislature! Phil Connor!\r\nGreat heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis sat dumb with dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he can send you to Joliet, if he wants to!\xe2\x80\x9d declared the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I have Scully get me off before he finds out about it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nJurgis, at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Scully\xe2\x80\x99s out of town,\xe2\x80\x9d the other answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know\r\nwhere he is\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s run away to dodge the strike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a pretty mess, indeed. Poor Jurgis sat half-dazed. His pull\r\nhad run up against a bigger pull, and he was down and out! \xe2\x80\x9cBut what am\r\nI going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, weakly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even dare to get bail\r\nfor you\xe2\x80\x94why, I might ruin myself for life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was silence. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you do it for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\npretend that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who I\xe2\x80\x99d hit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what good would that do you when you came to stand trial?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nHarper. Then he sat buried in thought for a minute or two. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94unless it\xe2\x80\x99s this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI could have your bail reduced;\r\nand then if you had the money you could pay it and skip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much will it be?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked, after he had had this explained\r\nmore in detail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got about three hundred dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d was Harper\xe2\x80\x99s reply, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and get you off\r\nfor that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the risk for friendship\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94for I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to see\r\nyou sent to state\xe2\x80\x99s prison for a year or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so finally Jurgis ripped out his bankbook\xe2\x80\x94which was sewed up in his\r\ntrousers\xe2\x80\x94and signed an order, which \xe2\x80\x9cBush\xe2\x80\x9d Harper wrote, for all the\r\nmoney to be paid out. Then the latter went and got it, and hurried to\r\nthe court, and explained to the magistrate that Jurgis was a decent\r\nfellow and a friend of Scully\xe2\x80\x99s, who had been attacked by a\r\nstrike-breaker. So the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars, and\r\nHarper went on it himself; he did not tell this to Jurgis, however\xe2\x80\x94nor\r\ndid he tell him that when the time for trial came it would be an easy\r\nmatter for him to avoid the forfeiting of the bail, and pocket the\r\nthree hundred dollars as his reward for the risk of offending Mike\r\nScully! All that he told Jurgis was that he was now free, and that the\r\nbest thing he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible; and so\r\nJurgis overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, took the dollar and\r\nfourteen cents that was left him out of all his bank account, and put\r\nit with the two dollars and quarter that was left from his last night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncelebration, and boarded a streetcar and got off at the other end of\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Jurgis was now an outcast and a tramp once more. He was\r\ncrippled\xe2\x80\x94he was as literally crippled as any wild animal which has lost\r\nits claws, or been torn out of its shell. He had been shorn, at one\r\ncut, of all those mysterious weapons whereby he had been able to make a\r\nliving easily and to escape the consequences of his actions. He could\r\nno longer command a job when he wanted it; he could no longer steal\r\nwith impunity\xe2\x80\x94he must take his chances with the common herd. Nay worse,\r\nhe dared not mingle with the herd\xe2\x80\x94he must hide himself, for he was one\r\nmarked out for destruction. His old companions would betray him, for\r\nthe sake of the influence they would gain thereby; and he would be made\r\nto suffer, not merely for the offense he had committed, but for others\r\nwhich would be laid at his door, just as had been done for some poor\r\ndevil on the occasion of that assault upon the \xe2\x80\x9ccountry customer\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\nhim and Duane.\r\n\r\nAnd also he labored under another handicap now. He had acquired new\r\nstandards of living, which were not easily to be altered. When he had\r\nbeen out of work before, he had been content if he could sleep in a\r\ndoorway or under a truck out of the rain, and if he could get fifteen\r\ncents a day for saloon lunches. But now he desired all sorts of other\r\nthings, and suffered because he had to do without them. He must have a\r\ndrink now and then, a drink for its own sake, and apart from the food\r\nthat came with it. The craving for it was strong enough to master every\r\nother consideration\xe2\x80\x94he would have it, though it were his last nickel\r\nand he had to starve the balance of the day in consequence.\r\n\r\nJurgis became once more a besieger of factory gates. But never since he\r\nhad been in Chicago had he stood less chance of getting a job than just\r\nthen. For one thing, there was the economic crisis, the million or two\r\nof men who had been out of work in the spring and summer, and were not\r\nyet all back, by any means. And then there was the strike, with seventy\r\nthousand men and women all over the country idle for a couple of\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x94twenty thousand in Chicago, and many of them now seeking work\r\nthroughout the city. It did not remedy matters that a few days later\r\nthe strike was given up and about half the strikers went back to work;\r\nfor every one taken on, there was a \xe2\x80\x9cscab\xe2\x80\x9d who gave up and fled. The\r\nten or fifteen thousand \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d Negroes, foreigners, and criminals were\r\nnow being turned loose to shift for themselves. Everywhere Jurgis went\r\nhe kept meeting them, and he was in an agony of fear lest some one of\r\nthem should know that he was \xe2\x80\x9cwanted.\xe2\x80\x9d He would have left Chicago, only\r\nby the time he had realized his danger he was almost penniless; and it\r\nwould be better to go to jail than to be caught out in the country in\r\nthe winter time.\r\n\r\nAt the end of about ten days Jurgis had only a few pennies left; and he\r\nhad not yet found a job\xe2\x80\x94not even a day\xe2\x80\x99s work at anything, not a chance\r\nto carry a satchel. Once again, as when he had come out of the\r\nhospital, he was bound hand and foot, and facing the grisly phantom of\r\nstarvation. Raw, naked terror possessed him, a maddening passion that\r\nwould never leave him, and that wore him down more quickly than the\r\nactual want of food. He was going to die of hunger! The fiend reached\r\nout its scaly arms for him\xe2\x80\x94it touched him, its breath came into his\r\nface; and he would cry out for the awfulness of it, he would wake up in\r\nthe night, shuddering, and bathed in perspiration, and start up and\r\nflee. He would walk, begging for work, until he was exhausted; he could\r\nnot remain still\xe2\x80\x94he would wander on, gaunt and haggard, gazing about\r\nhim with restless eyes. Everywhere he went, from one end of the vast\r\ncity to the other, there were hundreds of others like him; everywhere\r\nwas the sight of plenty and the merciless hand of authority waving them\r\naway. There is one kind of prison where the man is behind bars, and\r\neverything that he desires is outside; and there is another kind where\r\nthe things are behind the bars, and the man is outside.\r\n\r\nWhen he was down to his last quarter, Jurgis learned that before the\r\nbakeshops closed at night they sold out what was left at half price,\r\nand after that he would go and get two loaves of stale bread for a\r\nnickel, and break them up and stuff his pockets with them, munching a\r\nbit from time to time. He would not spend a penny save for this; and,\r\nafter two or three days more, he even became sparing of the bread, and\r\nwould stop and peer into the ash barrels as he walked along the\r\nstreets, and now and then rake out a bit of something, shake it free\r\nfrom dust, and count himself just so many minutes further from the end.\r\n\r\nSo for several days he had been going about, ravenous all the time, and\r\ngrowing weaker and weaker, and then one morning he had a hideous\r\nexperience, that almost broke his heart. He was passing down a street\r\nlined with warehouses, and a boss offered him a job, and then, after he\r\nhad started to work, turned him off because he was not strong enough.\r\nAnd he stood by and saw another man put into his place, and then picked\r\nup his coat, and walked off, doing all that he could to keep from\r\nbreaking down and crying like a baby. He was lost! He was doomed! There\r\nwas no hope for him! But then, with a sudden rush, his fear gave place\r\nto rage. He fell to cursing. He would come back there after dark, and\r\nhe would show that scoundrel whether he was good for anything or not!\r\n\r\nHe was still muttering this when suddenly, at the corner, he came upon\r\na green-grocery, with a tray full of cabbages in front of it. Jurgis,\r\nafter one swift glance about him, stooped and seized the biggest of\r\nthem, and darted round the corner with it. There was a hue and cry, and\r\na score of men and boys started in chase of him; but he came to an\r\nalley, and then to another branching off from it and leading him into\r\nanother street, where he fell into a walk, and slipped his cabbage\r\nunder his coat and went off unsuspected in the crowd. When he had\r\ngotten a safe distance away he sat down and devoured half the cabbage\r\nraw, stowing the balance away in his pockets till the next day.\r\n\r\nJust about this time one of the Chicago newspapers, which made much of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9ccommon people,\xe2\x80\x9d opened a \xe2\x80\x9cfree-soup kitchen\xe2\x80\x9d for the benefit of\r\nthe unemployed. Some people said that they did this for the sake of the\r\nadvertising it gave them, and some others said that their motive was a\r\nfear lest all their readers should be starved off; but whatever the\r\nreason, the soup was thick and hot, and there was a bowl for every man,\r\nall night long. When Jurgis heard of this, from a fellow \xe2\x80\x9chobo,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nvowed that he would have half a dozen bowls before morning; but, as it\r\nproved, he was lucky to get one, for there was a line of men two blocks\r\nlong before the stand, and there was just as long a line when the place\r\nwas finally closed up.\r\n\r\nThis depot was within the danger line for Jurgis\xe2\x80\x94in the \xe2\x80\x9cL\xc3\xaav\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndistrict, where he was known; but he went there, all the same, for he\r\nwas desperate, and beginning to think of even the Bridewell as a place\r\nof refuge. So far the weather had been fair, and he had slept out every\r\nnight in a vacant lot; but now there fell suddenly a shadow of the\r\nadvancing winter, a chill wind from the north and a driving storm of\r\nrain. That day Jurgis bought two drinks for the sake of the shelter,\r\nand at night he spent his last two pennies in a \xe2\x80\x9cstale-beer dive.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nwas a place kept by a Negro, who went out and drew off the old dregs of\r\nbeer that lay in barrels set outside of the saloons; and after he had\r\ndoctored it with chemicals to make it \xe2\x80\x9cfizz,\xe2\x80\x9d he sold it for two cents\r\na can, the purchase of a can including the privilege of sleeping the\r\nnight through upon the floor, with a mass of degraded outcasts, men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAll these horrors afflicted Jurgis all the more cruelly, because he was\r\nalways contrasting them with the opportunities he had lost. For\r\ninstance, just now it was election time again\xe2\x80\x94within five or six weeks\r\nthe voters of the country would select a President; and he heard the\r\nwretches with whom he associated discussing it, and saw the streets of\r\nthe city decorated with placards and banners\xe2\x80\x94and what words could\r\ndescribe the pangs of grief and despair that shot through him?\r\n\r\nFor instance, there was a night during this cold spell. He had begged\r\nall day, for his very life, and found not a soul to heed him, until\r\ntoward evening he saw an old lady getting off a streetcar and helped\r\nher down with her umbrellas and bundles and then told her his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chard-luck story,\xe2\x80\x9d and after answering all her suspicious questions\r\nsatisfactorily, was taken to a restaurant and saw a quarter paid down\r\nfor a meal. And so he had soup and bread, and boiled beef and potatoes\r\nand beans, and pie and coffee, and came out with his skin stuffed tight\r\nas a football. And then, through the rain and the darkness, far down\r\nthe street he saw red lights flaring and heard the thumping of a bass\r\ndrum; and his heart gave a leap, and he made for the place on the\r\nrun\xe2\x80\x94knowing without the asking that it meant a political meeting.\r\n\r\nThe campaign had so far been characterized by what the newspapers\r\ntermed \xe2\x80\x9capathy.\xe2\x80\x9d For some reason the people refused to get excited over\r\nthe struggle, and it was almost impossible to get them to come to\r\nmeetings, or to make any noise when they did come. Those which had been\r\nheld in Chicago so far had proven most dismal failures, and tonight,\r\nthe speaker being no less a personage than a candidate for the\r\nvice-presidency of the nation, the political managers had been\r\ntrembling with anxiety. But a merciful providence had sent this storm\r\nof cold rain\xe2\x80\x94and now all it was necessary to do was to set off a few\r\nfireworks, and thump awhile on a drum, and all the homeless wretches\r\nfrom a mile around would pour in and fill the hall! And then on the\r\nmorrow the newspapers would have a chance to report the tremendous\r\novation, and to add that it had been no \xe2\x80\x9csilk-stocking\xe2\x80\x9d audience,\r\neither, proving clearly that the high tariff sentiments of the\r\ndistinguished candidate were pleasing to the wage-earners of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis found himself in a large hall, elaborately decorated with\r\nflags and bunting; and after the chairman had made his little speech,\r\nand the orator of the evening rose up, amid an uproar from the\r\nband\xe2\x80\x94only fancy the emotions of Jurgis upon making the discovery that\r\nthe personage was none other than the famous and eloquent Senator\r\nSpareshanks, who had addressed the \xe2\x80\x9cDoyle Republican Association\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nthe stockyards, and helped to elect Mike Scully\xe2\x80\x99s tenpin setter to the\r\nChicago Board of Aldermen!\r\n\r\nIn truth, the sight of the senator almost brought the tears into\r\nJurgis\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. What agony it was to him to look back upon those golden\r\nhours, when he, too, had a place beneath the shadow of the plum tree!\r\nWhen he, too, had been of the elect, through whom the country is\r\ngoverned\xe2\x80\x94when he had had a bung in the campaign barrel for his own! And\r\nthis was another election in which the Republicans had all the money;\r\nand but for that one hideous accident he might have had a share of it,\r\ninstead of being where he was!\r\n\r\nThe eloquent senator was explaining the system of protection; an\r\ningenious device whereby the workingman permitted the manufacturer to\r\ncharge him higher prices, in order that he might receive higher wages;\r\nthus taking his money out of his pocket with one hand, and putting a\r\npart of it back with the other. To the senator this unique arrangement\r\nhad somehow become identified with the higher verities of the universe.\r\nIt was because of it that Columbia was the gem of the ocean; and all\r\nher future triumphs, her power and good repute among the nations,\r\ndepended upon the zeal and fidelity with which each citizen held up the\r\nhands of those who were toiling to maintain it. The name of this heroic\r\ncompany was \xe2\x80\x9cthe Grand Old Party\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd here the band began to play, and Jurgis sat up with a violent\r\nstart. Singular as it may seem, Jurgis was making a desperate effort to\r\nunderstand what the senator was saying\xe2\x80\x94to comprehend the extent of\r\nAmerican prosperity, the enormous expansion of American commerce, and\r\nthe Republic\xe2\x80\x99s future in the Pacific and in South America, and wherever\r\nelse the oppressed were groaning. The reason for it was that he wanted\r\nto keep awake. He knew that if he allowed himself to fall asleep he\r\nwould begin to snore loudly; and so he must listen\xe2\x80\x94he must be\r\ninterested! But he had eaten such a big dinner, and he was so\r\nexhausted, and the hall was so warm, and his seat was so comfortable!\r\nThe senator\xe2\x80\x99s gaunt form began to grow dim and hazy, to tower before\r\nhim and dance about, with figures of exports and imports. Once his\r\nneighbor gave him a savage poke in the ribs, and he sat up with a start\r\nand tried to look innocent; but then he was at it again, and men began\r\nto stare at him with annoyance, and to call out in vexation. Finally\r\none of them called a policeman, who came and grabbed Jurgis by the\r\ncollar, and jerked him to his feet, bewildered and terrified. Some of\r\nthe audience turned to see the commotion, and Senator Spareshanks\r\nfaltered in his speech; but a voice shouted cheerily: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just\r\nfiring a bum! Go ahead, old sport!\xe2\x80\x9d And so the crowd roared, and the\r\nsenator smiled genially, and went on; and in a few seconds poor Jurgis\r\nfound himself landed out in the rain, with a kick and a string of\r\ncurses.\r\n\r\nHe got into the shelter of a doorway and took stock of himself. He was\r\nnot hurt, and he was not arrested\xe2\x80\x94more than he had any right to expect.\r\nHe swore at himself and his luck for a while, and then turned his\r\nthoughts to practical matters. He had no money, and no place to sleep;\r\nhe must begin begging again.\r\n\r\nHe went out, hunching his shoulders together and shivering at the touch\r\nof the icy rain. Coming down the street toward him was a lady, well\r\ndressed, and protected by an umbrella; and he turned and walked beside\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9ccould you lend me the price of a\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s lodging? I\xe2\x80\x99m a poor working-man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he stopped short. By the light of a street lamp he had\r\ncaught sight of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s face. He knew her.\r\n\r\nIt was Alena Jasaityte, who had been the belle of his wedding feast!\r\nAlena Jasaityte, who had looked so beautiful, and danced with such a\r\nqueenly air, with Juozas Raczius, the teamster! Jurgis had only seen\r\nher once or twice afterward, for Juozas had thrown her over for another\r\ngirl, and Alena had gone away from Packingtown, no one knew where. And\r\nnow he met her here!\r\n\r\nShe was as much surprised as he was. \xe2\x80\x9cJurgis Rudkus!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat in the world is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve had hard luck,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m out of work, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nhome and no money. And you, Alena\xe2\x80\x94are you married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not married, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood staring at each other for a few moments longer. Finally\r\nAlena spoke again. \xe2\x80\x9cJurgis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d help you if I could, upon\r\nmy word I would, but it happens that I\xe2\x80\x99ve come out without my purse,\r\nand I honestly haven\xe2\x80\x99t a penny with me: I can do something better for\r\nyou, though\xe2\x80\x94I can tell you how to get help. I can tell you where Marija\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis gave a start. \xe2\x80\x9cMarija!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alena; \xe2\x80\x9cand she\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a place, and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoing well; she\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not much more than a year since Jurgis had left Packingtown,\r\nfeeling like one escaped from jail; and it had been from Marija and\r\nElzbieta that he was escaping. But now, at the mere mention of them,\r\nhis whole being cried out with joy. He wanted to see them; he wanted to\r\ngo home! They would help him\xe2\x80\x94they would be kind to him. In a flash he\r\nhad thought over the situation. He had a good excuse for running\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94his grief at the death of his son; and also he had a good excuse\r\nfor not returning\xe2\x80\x94the fact that they had left Packingtown. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she gave him a number on Clark Street, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need to\r\ngive you my address, because Marija knows it.\xe2\x80\x9d And Jurgis set out,\r\nwithout further ado. He found a large brownstone house of aristocratic\r\nappearance, and rang the basement bell. A young colored girl came to\r\nthe door, opening it about an inch, and gazing at him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Marija Berczynskas live here?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you want wid her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a relative of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated a moment. Then she opened the door and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis came and stood in the hall, and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nsee. What\xe2\x80\x99s yo\xe2\x80\x99 name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her it\xe2\x80\x99s Jurgis,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, and the girl went upstairs. She\r\ncame back at the end of a minute or two, and replied, \xe2\x80\x9cDey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nsich person here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis\xe2\x80\x99s heart went down into his boots. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told this was where she\r\nlived!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. But the girl only shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cDe lady says dey\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no sich person here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd he stood for a moment, hesitating, helpless with dismay. Then he\r\nturned to go to the door. At the same instant, however, there came a\r\nknock upon it, and the girl went to open it. Jurgis heard the shuffling\r\nof feet, and then heard her give a cry; and the next moment she sprang\r\nback, and past him, her eyes shining white with terror, and bounded up\r\nthe stairway, screaming at the top of her lungs: \xe2\x80\x9c_Police! Police!\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re pinched!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis stood for a second, bewildered. Then, seeing blue-coated forms\r\nrushing upon him, he sprang after the Negress. Her cries had been the\r\nsignal for a wild uproar above; the house was full of people, and as he\r\nentered the hallway he saw them rushing hither and thither, crying and\r\nscreaming with alarm. There were men and women, the latter clad for the\r\nmost part in wrappers, the former in all stages of _d\xc3\xa9shabille_. At one\r\nside Jurgis caught a glimpse of a big apartment with plush-covered\r\nchairs, and tables covered with trays and glasses. There were playing\r\ncards scattered all over the floor\xe2\x80\x94one of the tables had been upset,\r\nand bottles of wine were rolling about, their contents running out upon\r\nthe carpet. There was a young girl who had fainted, and two men who\r\nwere supporting her; and there were a dozen others crowding toward the\r\nfront door.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, there came a series of resounding blows upon it,\r\ncausing the crowd to give back. At the same instant a stout woman, with\r\npainted cheeks and diamonds in her ears, came running down the stairs,\r\npanting breathlessly: \xe2\x80\x9cTo the rear! Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led the way to a back staircase, Jurgis following; in the kitchen\r\nshe pressed a spring, and a cupboard gave way and opened, disclosing a\r\ndark passageway. \xe2\x80\x9cGo in!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to the crowd, which now amounted to\r\ntwenty or thirty, and they began to pass through. Scarcely had the last\r\none disappeared, however, before there were cries from in front, and\r\nthen the panic-stricken throng poured out again, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthere too! We\xe2\x80\x99re trapped!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the woman, and there was another rush of the mob,\r\nwomen and men cursing and screaming and fighting to be first. One\r\nflight, two, three\xe2\x80\x94and then there was a ladder to the roof, with a\r\ncrowd packed at the foot of it, and one man at the top, straining and\r\nstruggling to lift the trap door. It was not to be stirred, however,\r\nand when the woman shouted up to unhook it, he answered: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s already\r\nunhooked. There\xe2\x80\x99s somebody sitting on it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a moment later came a voice from downstairs: \xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well\r\nquit, you people. We mean business, this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the crowd subsided; and a few moments later several policemen came\r\nup, staring here and there, and leering at their victims. Of the latter\r\nthe men were for the most part frightened and sheepish-looking. The\r\nwomen took it as a joke, as if they were used to it\xe2\x80\x94though if they had\r\nbeen pale, one could not have told, for the paint on their cheeks. One\r\nblack-eyed young girl perched herself upon the top of the balustrade,\r\nand began to kick with her slippered foot at the helmets of the\r\npolicemen, until one of them caught her by the ankle and pulled her\r\ndown. On the floor below four or five other girls sat upon trunks in\r\nthe hall, making fun of the procession which filed by them. They were\r\nnoisy and hilarious, and had evidently been drinking; one of them, who\r\nwore a bright red kimono, shouted and screamed in a voice that drowned\r\nout all the other sounds in the hall\xe2\x80\x94and Jurgis took a glance at her,\r\nand then gave a start, and a cry, \xe2\x80\x9cMarija!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe heard him, and glanced around; then she shrank back and half sprang\r\nto her feet in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cJurgis!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two they stood staring at each other. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d Marija exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you know\xe2\x80\x94who told you I was here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlena Jasaityte. I met her on the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence, while they gazed at each other. The rest of\r\nthe crowd was watching them, and so Marija got up and came closer to\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija, \xe2\x80\x9cI live here.\xe2\x80\x9d Then suddenly came a hail from\r\nbelow: \xe2\x80\x9cGet your clothes on now, girls, and come along. You\xe2\x80\x99d best\r\nbegin, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s raining outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBr-r-r!\xe2\x80\x9d shivered some one, and the women got up and entered the\r\nvarious doors which lined the hallway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija, and took Jurgis into her room, which was a tiny\r\nplace about eight by six, with a cot and a chair and a dressing stand\r\nand some dresses hanging behind the door. There were clothes scattered\r\nabout on the floor, and hopeless confusion everywhere\xe2\x80\x94boxes of rouge\r\nand bottles of perfume mixed with hats and soiled dishes on the\r\ndresser, and a pair of slippers and a clock and a whisky bottle on a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nMarija had nothing on but a kimono and a pair of stockings; yet she\r\nproceeded to dress before Jurgis, and without even taking the trouble\r\nto close the door. He had by this time divined what sort of a place he\r\nwas in; and he had seen a great deal of the world since he had left\r\nhome, and was not easy to shock\xe2\x80\x94and yet it gave him a painful start\r\nthat Marija should do this. They had always been decent people at home,\r\nand it seemed to him that the memory of old times ought to have ruled\r\nher. But then he laughed at himself for a fool. What was he, to be\r\npretending to decency!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been living here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly a year,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to live,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the children starve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, watching her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were out of work?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nfinally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got sick,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand after that I had no money. And then\r\nStanislovas died\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStanislovas dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did he die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats killed him,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nJurgis gave a gasp. \xe2\x80\x9c_Rats_ killed him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other; she was bending over, lacing her shoes as she\r\nspoke. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was working in an oil factory\xe2\x80\x94at least he was hired by the\r\nmen to get their beer. He used to carry cans on a long pole; and he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndrink a little out of each can, and one day he drank too much, and fell\r\nasleep in a corner, and got locked up in the place all night. When they\r\nfound him the rats had killed him and eaten him nearly all up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis sat, frozen with horror. Marija went on lacing up her shoes.\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a big policeman came to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cHurry up, there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs quick as I can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija, and she stood up and began putting on\r\nher corsets with feverish haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the rest of the people alive?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jurgis, finally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey live not far from here. They\xe2\x80\x99re all right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are working?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElzbieta is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she can. I take care of them most of\r\nthe time\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m making plenty of money now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis was silent for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cDo they know you live here\xe2\x80\x94how you\r\nlive?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElzbieta knows,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Marija. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie to her. And maybe\r\nthe children have found out by this time. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be ashamed\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94we can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Tamoszius?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes _he_ know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija shrugged her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen him for over a year. He got blood poisoning and lost one finger,\r\nand couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play the violin any more; and then he went away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija was standing in front of the glass fastening her dress. Jurgis\r\nsat staring at her. He could hardly believe that she was the same woman\r\nhe had known in the old days; she was so quiet\xe2\x80\x94so hard! It struck fear\r\nto his heart to watch her.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly she gave a glance at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look as if you had been\r\nhaving a rough time of it yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a cent in my pockets, and nothing to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll over. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hoboing it. Then I went back to the yards\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nbefore the strike.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused for a moment, hesitating. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked for\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI found you had gone away, no one knew where. Perhaps\r\nyou think I did you a dirty trick running away as I did, Marija\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you. We never have\xe2\x80\x94any of us. You\r\ndid your best\xe2\x80\x94the job was too much for us.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused a moment, then\r\nadded: \xe2\x80\x9cWe were too ignorant\xe2\x80\x94that was the trouble. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand any\r\nchance. If I\xe2\x80\x99d known what I know now we\xe2\x80\x99d have won out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d have come here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I meant. I meant you\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ndifferently you would have behaved\xe2\x80\x94about Ona.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis was silent; he had never thought of that aspect of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen people are starving,\xe2\x80\x9d the other continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand they have\r\nanything with a price, they ought to sell it, I say. I guess you\r\nrealize it now when it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Ona could have taken care of us all,\r\nin the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d Marija spoke without emotion, as one who had come to\r\nregard things from the business point of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94yes, I guess so,\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis answered hesitatingly. He did not add that\r\nhe had paid three hundred dollars, and a foreman\xe2\x80\x99s job, for the\r\nsatisfaction of knocking down \xe2\x80\x9cPhil\xe2\x80\x9d Connor a second time.\r\n\r\nThe policeman came to the door again just then. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cLively!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija, reaching for her hat, which was big enough to\r\nbe a drum major\xe2\x80\x99s, and full of ostrich feathers. She went out into the\r\nhall and Jurgis followed, the policeman remaining to look under the bed\r\nand behind the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going to come of this?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis asked, as they started down the\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe raid, you mean? Oh, nothing\xe2\x80\x94it happens to us every now and then.\r\nThe madame\xe2\x80\x99s having some sort of time with the police; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat it is, but maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll come to terms before morning. Anyhow,\r\nthey won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to you. They always let the men off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe so,\xe2\x80\x9d he responded, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m in for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m wanted by the police,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, lowering his voice, though of\r\ncourse their conversation was in Lithuanian. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll send me up for a\r\nyear or two, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can\xe2\x80\x99t get you off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDownstairs, where the greater part of the prisoners were now massed,\r\nshe sought out the stout personage with the diamond earrings, and had a\r\nfew whispered words with her. The latter then approached the police\r\nsergeant who was in charge of the raid. \xe2\x80\x9cBilly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing to\r\nJurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow who came in to see his sister. He\xe2\x80\x99d just got\r\nin the door when you knocked. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t taking hoboes, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant laughed as he looked at Jurgis. \xe2\x80\x9cSorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\norders are every one but the servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis slunk in among the rest of the men, who kept dodging behind\r\neach other like sheep that have smelled a wolf. There were old men and\r\nyoung men, college boys and gray-beards old enough to be their\r\ngrandfathers; some of them wore evening dress\xe2\x80\x94there was no one among\r\nthem save Jurgis who showed any signs of poverty.\r\n\r\nWhen the roundup was completed, the doors were opened and the party\r\nmarched out. Three patrol wagons were drawn up at the curb, and the\r\nwhole neighborhood had turned out to see the sport; there was much\r\nchaffing, and a universal craning of necks. The women stared about them\r\nwith defiant eyes, or laughed and joked, while the men kept their heads\r\nbowed, and their hats pulled over their faces. They were crowded into\r\nthe patrol wagons as if into streetcars, and then off they went amid a\r\ndin of cheers. At the station house Jurgis gave a Polish name and was\r\nput into a cell with half a dozen others; and while these sat and\r\ntalked in whispers, he lay down in a corner and gave himself up to his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nJurgis had looked into the deepest reaches of the social pit, and grown\r\nused to the sights in them. Yet when he had thought of all humanity as\r\nvile and hideous, he had somehow always excepted his own family that he\r\nhad loved; and now this sudden horrible discovery\xe2\x80\x94Marija a whore, and\r\nElzbieta and the children living off her shame! Jurgis might argue with\r\nhimself all he chose, that he had done worse, and was a fool for\r\ncaring\xe2\x80\x94but still he could not get over the shock of that sudden\r\nunveiling, he could not help being sunk in grief because of it. The\r\ndepths of him were troubled and shaken, memories were stirred in him\r\nthat had been sleeping so long he had counted them dead. Memories of\r\nthe old life\xe2\x80\x94his old hopes and his old yearnings, his old dreams of\r\ndecency and independence! He saw Ona again, he heard her gentle voice\r\npleading with him. He saw little Antanas, whom he had meant to make a\r\nman. He saw his trembling old father, who had blessed them all with his\r\nwonderful love. He lived again through that day of horror when he had\r\ndiscovered Ona\xe2\x80\x99s shame\xe2\x80\x94God, how he had suffered, what a madman he had\r\nbeen! How dreadful it had all seemed to him; and now, today, he had sat\r\nand listened, and half agreed when Marija told him he had been a fool!\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94told him that he ought to have sold his wife\xe2\x80\x99s honor and lived by\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x94And then there was Stanislovas and his awful fate\xe2\x80\x94that brief story\r\nwhich Marija had narrated so calmly, with such dull indifference! The\r\npoor little fellow, with his frostbitten fingers and his terror of the\r\nsnow\xe2\x80\x94his wailing voice rang in Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s ears, as he lay there in the\r\ndarkness, until the sweat started on his forehead. Now and then he\r\nwould quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little\r\nStanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his life\r\nwith the rats!\r\n\r\nAll these emotions had become strangers to the soul of Jurgis; it was\r\nso long since they had troubled him that he had ceased to think they\r\nmight ever trouble him again. Helpless, trapped, as he was, what good\r\ndid they do him\xe2\x80\x94why should he ever have allowed them to torment him? It\r\nhad been the task of his recent life to fight them down, to crush them\r\nout of him; never in his life would he have suffered from them again,\r\nsave that they had caught him unawares, and overwhelmed him before he\r\ncould protect himself. He heard the old voices of his soul, he saw its\r\nold ghosts beckoning to him, stretching out their arms to him! But they\r\nwere far-off and shadowy, and the gulf between them was black and\r\nbottomless; they would fade away into the mists of the past once more.\r\nTheir voices would die, and never again would he hear them\xe2\x80\x94and so the\r\nlast faint spark of manhood in his soul would flicker out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Jurgis was driven to the court, which was crowded with\r\nthe prisoners and those who had come out of curiosity or in the hope of\r\nrecognizing one of the men and getting a case for blackmail. The men\r\nwere called up first, and reprimanded in a bunch, and then dismissed;\r\nbut, Jurgis, to his terror, was called separately, as being a\r\nsuspicious-looking case. It was in this very same court that he had\r\nbeen tried, that time when his sentence had been \xe2\x80\x9csuspended\xe2\x80\x9d; it was\r\nthe same judge, and the same clerk. The latter now stared at Jurgis, as\r\nif he half thought that he knew him; but the judge had no\r\nsuspicions\xe2\x80\x94just then his thoughts were upon a telephone message he was\r\nexpecting from a friend of the police captain of the district, telling\r\nwhat disposition he should make of the case of \xe2\x80\x9cPolly\xe2\x80\x9d Simpson, as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmadame\xe2\x80\x9d of the house was known. Meantime, he listened to the story of\r\nhow Jurgis had been looking for his sister, and advised him dryly to\r\nkeep his sister in a better place; then he let him go, and proceeded to\r\nfine each of the girls five dollars, which fines were paid in a bunch\r\nfrom a wad of bills which Madame Polly extracted from her stocking.\r\n\r\nJurgis waited outside and walked home with Marija. The police had left\r\nthe house, and already there were a few visitors; by evening the place\r\nwould be running again, exactly as if nothing had happened. Meantime,\r\nMarija took Jurgis upstairs to her room, and they sat and talked. By\r\ndaylight, Jurgis was able to observe that the color on her cheeks was\r\nnot the old natural one of abounding health; her complexion was in\r\nreality a parchment yellow, and there were black rings under her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been sick?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSick?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHell!\xe2\x80\x9d (Marija had learned to scatter her\r\nconversation with as many oaths as a longshoreman or a mule driver.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I ever be anything but sick, at this life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fell silent for a moment, staring ahead of her gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmorphine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI seem to take more of it every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the way of it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that, it\xe2\x80\x99s drink. If\r\nthe girls didn\xe2\x80\x99t booze they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it any time at all. And the\r\nmadame always gives them dope when they first come, and they learn to\r\nlike it; or else they take it for headaches and such things, and get\r\nthe habit that way. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, I know; I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to quit, but I\r\nnever will while I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long are you going to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways, I guess. What else could I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you save any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, no! I get enough, I suppose, but it\r\nall goes. I get a half share, two dollars and a half for each customer,\r\nand sometimes I make twenty-five or thirty dollars a night, and you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthink I ought to save something out of that! But then I am charged for\r\nmy room and my meals\xe2\x80\x94and such prices as you never heard of; and then\r\nfor extras, and drinks\xe2\x80\x94for everything I get, and some I don\xe2\x80\x99t. My\r\nlaundry bill is nearly twenty dollars each week alone\xe2\x80\x94think of that!\r\nYet what can I do? I either have to stand it or quit, and it would be\r\nthe same anywhere else. It\xe2\x80\x99s all I can do to save the fifteen dollars I\r\ngive Elzbieta each week, so the children can go to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija sat brooding in silence for a while; then, seeing that Jurgis\r\nwas interested, she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way they keep the girls\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nlet them run up debts, so they can\xe2\x80\x99t get away. A young girl comes from\r\nabroad, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know a word of English, and she gets into a\r\nplace like this, and when she wants to go the madame shows her that she\r\nis a couple of hundred dollars in debt, and takes all her clothes away,\r\nand threatens to have her arrested if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay and do as she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntold. So she stays, and the longer she stays, the more in debt she\r\ngets. Often, too, they are girls that didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were coming\r\nto, that had hired out for housework. Did you notice that little French\r\ngirl with the yellow hair, that stood next to me in the court?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she came to America about a year ago. She was a store clerk, and\r\nshe hired herself to a man to be sent here to work in a factory. There\r\nwere six of them, all together, and they were brought to a house just\r\ndown the street from here, and this girl was put into a room alone, and\r\nthey gave her some dope in her food, and when she came to she found\r\nthat she had been ruined. She cried, and screamed, and tore her hair,\r\nbut she had nothing but a wrapper, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get away, and they kept\r\nher half insensible with drugs all the time, until she gave up. She\r\nnever got outside of that place for ten months, and then they sent her\r\naway, because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit. I guess they\xe2\x80\x99ll put her out of here,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s getting to have crazy fits, from drinking absinthe. Only one\r\nof the girls that came out with her got away, and she jumped out of a\r\nsecond-story window one night. There was a great fuss about that\xe2\x80\x94maybe\r\nyou heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard of it afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d (It had happened in\r\nthe place where he and Duane had taken refuge from their \xe2\x80\x9ccountry\r\ncustomer.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl had become insane, fortunately for the police.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots of money in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey get as much as forty\r\ndollars a head for girls, and they bring them from all over. There are\r\nseventeen in this place, and nine different countries among them. In\r\nsome places you might find even more. We have half a dozen French\r\ngirls\xe2\x80\x94I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s because the madame speaks the language. French\r\ngirls are bad, too, the worst of all, except for the Japanese. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na place next door that\xe2\x80\x99s full of Japanese women, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in\r\nthe same house with one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija paused for a moment or two, and then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cMost of the\r\nwomen here are pretty decent\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised. I used to think they\r\ndid it because they liked to; but fancy a woman selling herself to\r\nevery kind of man that comes, old or young, black or white\xe2\x80\x94and doing it\r\nbecause she likes to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them say they do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cthey say anything. They\xe2\x80\x99re in, and they know they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get out. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it when they began\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d find\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s always misery! There\xe2\x80\x99s a little Jewish girl here who used to\r\nrun errands for a milliner, and got sick and lost her place; and she\r\nwas four days on the streets without a mouthful of food, and then she\r\nwent to a place just around the corner and offered herself, and they\r\nmade her give up her clothes before they would give her a bite to eat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarija sat for a minute or two, brooding somberly. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about\r\nyourself, Jurgis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he told her the long story of his adventures since his flight from\r\nhome; his life as a tramp, and his work in the freight tunnels, and the\r\naccident; and then of Jack Duane, and of his political career in the\r\nstockyards, and his downfall and subsequent failures. Marija listened\r\nwith sympathy; it was easy to believe the tale of his late starvation,\r\nfor his face showed it all. \xe2\x80\x9cYou found me just in the nick of time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand by you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you till you can get some work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to let you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Because I\xe2\x80\x99m here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I went off and left you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think about it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a minute or two. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay here\r\nto lunch\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll have something up in the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pressed a button, and a colored woman came to the door and took her\r\norder. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have somebody to wait on you,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, with\r\na laugh, as she lay back on the bed.\r\n\r\nAs the prison breakfast had not been liberal, Jurgis had a good\r\nappetite, and they had a little feast together, talking meanwhile of\r\nElzbieta and the children and old times. Shortly before they were\r\nthrough, there came another colored girl, with the message that the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmadame\xe2\x80\x9d wanted Marija\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLithuanian Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d as they called her here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means you have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Jurgis.\r\n\r\nSo he got up, and she gave him the new address of the family, a\r\ntenement over in the Ghetto district. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Jurgis stood hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHonest, Marija, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just give\r\nme a little money and let me look for work first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you need money?\xe2\x80\x9d was her reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAll you want is something to\r\neat and a place to sleep, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut then I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to go there after I left\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94and while I have nothing to do, and while you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marija, giving him a push. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking?\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive you money,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as she followed him to the door, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll drink it up, and do yourself harm. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quarter for you now,\r\nand go along, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be so glad to have you back, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ntime to feel ashamed. Good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went out, and walked down the street to think it over. He\r\ndecided that he would first try to get work, and so he put in the rest\r\nof the day wandering here and there among factories and warehouses\r\nwithout success. Then, when it was nearly dark, he concluded to go\r\nhome, and set out; but he came to a restaurant, and went in and spent\r\nhis quarter for a meal; and when he came out he changed his mind\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnight was pleasant, and he would sleep somewhere outside, and put in\r\nthe morrow hunting, and so have one more chance of a job. So he started\r\naway again, when suddenly he chanced to look about him, and found that\r\nhe was walking down the same street and past the same hall where he had\r\nlistened to the political speech the night before. There was no red\r\nfire and no band now, but there was a sign out, announcing a meeting,\r\nand a stream of people pouring in through the entrance. In a flash\r\nJurgis had decided that he would chance it once more, and sit down and\r\nrest while making up his mind what to do. There was no one taking\r\ntickets, so it must be a free show again.\r\n\r\nHe entered. There were no decorations in the hall this time; but there\r\nwas quite a crowd upon the platform, and almost every seat in the place\r\nwas filled. He took one of the last, far in the rear, and straightway\r\nforgot all about his surroundings. Would Elzbieta think that he had\r\ncome to sponge off her, or would she understand that he meant to get to\r\nwork again and do his share? Would she be decent to him, or would she\r\nscold him? If only he could get some sort of a job before he went\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthat last boss had only been willing to try him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then suddenly Jurgis looked up. A tremendous roar had burst from the\r\nthroats of the crowd, which by this time had packed the hall to the\r\nvery doors. Men and women were standing up, waving handkerchiefs,\r\nshouting, yelling. Evidently the speaker had arrived, thought Jurgis;\r\nwhat fools they were making of themselves! What were they expecting to\r\nget out of it anyhow\xe2\x80\x94what had they to do with elections, with governing\r\nthe country? Jurgis had been behind the scenes in politics.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his thoughts, but with one further fact to reckon\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94that he was caught here. The hall was now filled to the doors; and\r\nafter the meeting it would be too late for him to go home, so he would\r\nhave to make the best of it outside. Perhaps it would be better to go\r\nhome in the morning, anyway, for the children would be at school, and\r\nhe and Elzbieta could have a quiet explanation. She always had been a\r\nreasonable person; and he really did mean to do right. He would manage\r\nto persuade her of it\xe2\x80\x94and besides, Marija was willing, and Marija was\r\nfurnishing the money. If Elzbieta were ugly, he would tell her that in\r\nso many words.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis went on meditating; until finally, when he had been an hour\r\nor two in the hall, there began to prepare itself a repetition of the\r\ndismal catastrophe of the night before. Speaking had been going on all\r\nthe time, and the audience was clapping its hands and shouting,\r\nthrilling with excitement; and little by little the sounds were\r\nbeginning to blur in Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and his thoughts were beginning to\r\nrun together, and his head to wobble and nod. He caught himself many\r\ntimes, as usual, and made desperate resolutions; but the hall was hot\r\nand close, and his long walk and his dinner were too much for him\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe end his head sank forward and he went off again.\r\n\r\nAnd then again someone nudged him, and he sat up with his old terrified\r\nstart! He had been snoring again, of course! And now what? He fixed his\r\neyes ahead of him, with painful intensity, staring at the platform as\r\nif nothing else ever had interested him, or ever could interest him,\r\nall his life. He imagined the angry exclamations, the hostile glances;\r\nhe imagined the policeman striding toward him\xe2\x80\x94reaching for his neck. Or\r\nwas he to have one more chance? Were they going to let him alone this\r\ntime? He sat trembling; waiting\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly came a voice in his ear, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice, gentle and\r\nsweet, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would try to listen, comrade, perhaps you would be\r\ninterested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJurgis was more startled by that than he would have been by the touch\r\nof a policeman. He still kept his eyes fixed ahead, and did not stir;\r\nbut his heart gave a great leap. Comrade! Who was it that called him\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccomrade\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nHe waited long, long; and at last, when he was sure that he was no\r\nlonger watched, he stole a glance out of the corner of his eyes at the\r\nwoman who sat beside him. She was young and beautiful; she wore fine\r\nclothes, and was what is called a \xe2\x80\x9clady.\xe2\x80\x9d And she called him \xe2\x80\x9ccomrade\xe2\x80\x9d!\r\n\r\nHe turned a little, carefully, so that he could see her better; then he\r\nbegan to watch her, fascinated. She had apparently forgotten all about\r\nhim, and was looking toward the platform. A man was speaking\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94Jurgis heard his voice vaguely; but all his thoughts were for\r\nthis woman\xe2\x80\x99s face. A feeling of alarm stole over him as he stared at\r\nher. It made his flesh creep. What was the matter with her, what could\r\nbe going on, to affect any one like that? She sat as one turned to\r\nstone, her hands clenched tightly in her lap, so tightly that he could\r\nsee the cords standing out in her wrists. There was a look of\r\nexcitement upon her face, of tense effort, as of one struggling\r\nmightily, or witnessing a struggle. There was a faint quivering of her\r\nnostrils; and now and then she would moisten her lips with feverish\r\nhaste. Her bosom rose and fell as she breathed, and her excitement\r\nseemed to mount higher and higher, and then to sink away again, like a\r\nboat tossing upon ocean surges. What was it? What was the matter? It\r\nmust be something that the man was saying, up there on the platform.\r\nWhat sort of a man was he? And what sort of thing was this, anyhow?\xe2\x80\x94So\r\nall at once it occurred to Jurgis to look at the speaker.\r\n\r\nIt was like coming suddenly upon some wild sight of nature\xe2\x80\x94a mountain\r\nforest lashed by a tempest, a ship tossed about upon a stormy sea.\r\nJurgis had an unpleasant sensation, a sense of confusion, of disorder,\r\nof wild and meaningless uproar. The man was tall and gaunt, as haggard\r\nas his auditor himself; a thin black beard covered half of his face,\r\nand one could see only two black hollows where the eyes were. He was\r\nspeaking rapidly, in great excitement; he used many gestures\xe2\x80\x94as he\r\nspoke he moved here and there upon the stage, reaching with his long\r\narms as if to seize each person in his audience. His voice was deep,\r\nlike an organ; it was some time, however, before Jurgis thought of the\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94he was too much occupied with his eyes to think of what the man\r\nwas saying. But suddenly it seemed as if the speaker had begun pointing\r\nstraight at him, as if he had singled him out particularly for his\r\nremarks; and so Jurgis became suddenly aware of his voice, trembling,\r\nvibrant with emotion, with pain and longing, with a burden of things\r\nunutterable, not to be compassed by words. To hear it was to be\r\nsuddenly arrested, to be gripped, transfixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou listen to these things,\xe2\x80\x9d the man was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cand you say, \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\r\nthey are true, but they have been that way always.\xe2\x80\x99 Or you say, \xe2\x80\x98Maybe\r\nit will come, but not in my time\xe2\x80\x94it will not help me.\xe2\x80\x99 And so you\r\nreturn to your daily round of toil, you go back to be ground up for\r\nprofits in the world-wide mill of economic might! To toil long hours\r\nfor another\xe2\x80\x99s advantage; to live in mean and squalid homes, to work in\r\ndangerous and unhealthful places; to wrestle with the specters of\r\nhunger and privation, to take your chances of accident, disease, and\r\ndeath. And each day the struggle becomes fiercer, the pace more cruel;\r\neach day you have to toil a little harder, and feel the iron hand of\r\ncircumstance close upon you a little tighter. Months pass, years\r\nmaybe\xe2\x80\x94and then you come again; and again I am here to plead with you,\r\nto know if want and misery have yet done their work with you, if\r\ninjustice and oppression have yet opened your eyes! I shall still be\r\nwaiting\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing else that I can do. There is no wilderness\r\nwhere I can hide from these things, there is no haven where I can\r\nescape them; though I travel to the ends of the earth, I find the same\r\naccursed system\xe2\x80\x94I find that all the fair and noble impulses of\r\nhumanity, the dreams of poets and the agonies of martyrs, are shackled\r\nand bound in the service of organized and predatory Greed! And\r\ntherefore I cannot rest, I cannot be silent; therefore I cast aside\r\ncomfort and happiness, health and good repute\xe2\x80\x94and go out into the world\r\nand cry out the pain of my spirit! Therefore I am not to be silenced by\r\npoverty and sickness, not by hatred and obloquy, by threats and\r\nridicule\xe2\x80\x94not by prison and persecution, if they should come\xe2\x80\x94not by any\r\npower that is upon the earth or above the earth, that was, or is, or\r\never can be created. If I fail tonight, I can only try tomorrow;\r\nknowing that the fault must be mine\xe2\x80\x94that if once the vision of my soul\r\nwere spoken upon earth, if once the anguish of its defeat were uttered\r\nin human speech, it would break the stoutest barriers of prejudice, it\r\nwould shake the most sluggish soul to action! It would abash the most\r\ncynical, it would terrify the most selfish; and the voice of mockery\r\nwould be silenced, and fraud and falsehood would slink back into their\r\ndens, and the truth would stand forth alone! For I speak with the voice\r\nof the millions who are voiceless! Of them that are oppressed and have\r\nno comforter! Of the disinherited of life, for whom there is no respite\r\nand no deliverance, to whom the world is a prison, a dungeon of\r\ntorture, a tomb! With the voice of the little child who toils tonight\r\nin a Southern cotton mill, staggering with exhaustion, numb with agony,\r\nand knowing no hope but the grave! Of the mother who sews by\r\ncandlelight in her tenement garret, weary and weeping, smitten with the\r\nmortal hunger of her babes! Of the man who lies upon a bed of rags,\r\nwrestling in his last sickness and leaving his loved ones to perish! Of\r\nthe young girl who, somewhere at this moment, is walking the streets of\r\nthis horrible city, beaten and starving, and making her choice between\r\nthe brothel and the lake! With the voice of those, whoever and wherever\r\nthey may be, who are caught beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of\r\nGreed! With the voice of humanity, calling for deliverance! Of the\r\neverlasting soul of Man, arising from the dust; breaking its way out of\r\nits prison\xe2\x80\x94rending the bands of oppression and ignorance\xe2\x80\x94groping its\r\nway to the light!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused. There was an instant of silence, while men caught\r\ntheir breaths, and then like a single sound there came a cry from a\r\nthousand people. Through it all Jurgis sat still, motionless and rigid,\r\nhis eyes fixed upon the speaker; he was trembling, smitten with wonder.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man raised his hands, and silence fell, and he began\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI plead with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhoever you may be, provided that you\r\ncare about the truth; but most of all I plead with working-man, with\r\nthose to whom the evils I portray are not mere matters of sentiment, to\r\nbe dallied and toyed with, and then perhaps put aside and forgotten\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nwhom they are the grim and relentless realities of the daily grind, the\r\nchains upon their limbs, the lash upon their backs, the iron in their\r\nsouls. To you, working-men! To you, the toilers, who have made this\r\nland, and have no voice in its councils! To you, whose lot it is to sow\r\nthat others may reap, to labor and obey, and ask no more than the wages\r\nof a beast of burden, the food and shelter to keep you alive from day\r\nto day. It is to you that I come with my message of salvation, it is to\r\nyou that I appeal. I know how much it is to ask of you\xe2\x80\x94I know, for I\r\nhave been in your place, I have lived your life, and there is no man\r\nbefore me here tonight who knows it better. I have known what it is to\r\nbe a street-waif, a bootblack, living upon a crust of bread and\r\nsleeping in cellar stairways and under empty wagons. I have known what\r\nit is to dare and to aspire, to dream mighty dreams and to see them\r\nperish\xe2\x80\x94to see all the fair flowers of my spirit trampled into the mire\r\nby the wild-beast powers of my life. I know what is the price that a\r\nworking-man pays for knowledge\xe2\x80\x94I have paid for it with food and sleep,\r\nwith agony of body and mind, with health, almost with life itself; and\r\nso, when I come to you with a story of hope and freedom, with the\r\nvision of a new earth to be created, of a new labor to be dared, I am\r\nnot surprised that I find you sordid and material, sluggish and\r\nincredulous. That I do not despair is because I know also the forces\r\nthat are driving behind you\xe2\x80\x94because I know the raging lash of poverty,\r\nthe sting of contempt and mastership, \xe2\x80\x98the insolence of office and the\r\nspurns.\xe2\x80\x99 Because I feel sure that in the crowd that has come to me\r\ntonight, no matter how many may be dull and heedless, no matter how\r\nmany may have come out of idle curiosity, or in order to ridicule\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwill be some one man whom pain and suffering have made desperate, whom\r\nsome chance vision of wrong and horror has startled and shocked into\r\nattention. And to him my words will come like a sudden flash of\r\nlightning to one who travels in darkness\xe2\x80\x94revealing the way before him,\r\nthe perils and the obstacles\xe2\x80\x94solving all problems, making all\r\ndifficulties clear! The scales will fall from his eyes, the shackles\r\nwill be torn from his limbs\xe2\x80\x94he will leap up with a cry of thankfulness,\r\nhe will stride forth a free man at last! A man delivered from his\r\nself-created slavery! A man who will never more be trapped\xe2\x80\x94whom no\r\nblandishments will cajole, whom no threats will frighten; who from\r\ntonight on will move forward, and not backward, who will study and\r\nunderstand, who will gird on his sword and take his place in the army\r\nof his comrades and brothers. Who will carry the good tidings to\r\nothers, as I have carried them to him\xe2\x80\x94priceless gift of liberty and\r\nlight that is neither mine nor his, but is the heritage of the soul of\r\nman! Working-men, working-men\xe2\x80\x94comrades! open your eyes and look about\r\nyou! You have lived so long in the toil and heat that your senses are\r\ndulled, your souls are numbed; but realize once in your lives this\r\nworld in which you dwell\xe2\x80\x94tear off the rags of its customs and\r\nconventions\xe2\x80\x94behold it as it is, in all its hideous nakedness! Realize\r\nit, _realize it!_ Realize that out upon the plains of Manchuria tonight\r\ntwo hostile armies are facing each other\xe2\x80\x94that now, while we are seated\r\nhere, a million human beings may be hurled at each other\xe2\x80\x99s throats,\r\nstriving with the fury of maniacs to tear each other to pieces! And\r\nthis in the twentieth century, nineteen hundred years since the Prince\r\nof Peace was born on earth! Nineteen hundred years that his words have\r\nbeen preached as divine, and here two armies of men are rending and\r\ntearing each other like the wild beasts of the forest! Philosophers\r\nhave reasoned, prophets have denounced, poets have wept and pleaded\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nstill this hideous Monster roams at large! We have schools and\r\ncolleges, newspapers and books; we have searched the heavens and the\r\nearth, we have weighed and probed and reasoned\xe2\x80\x94and all to equip men to\r\ndestroy each other! We call it War, and pass it by\xe2\x80\x94but do not put me\r\noff with platitudes and conventions\xe2\x80\x94come with me, come with me\xe2\x80\x94_realize\r\nit!_ See the bodies of men pierced by bullets, blown into pieces by\r\nbursting shells! Hear the crunching of the bayonet, plunged into human\r\nflesh; hear the groans and shrieks of agony, see the faces of men\r\ncrazed by pain, turned into fiends by fury and hate! Put your hand upon\r\nthat piece of flesh\xe2\x80\x94it is hot and quivering\xe2\x80\x94just now it was a part of a\r\nman! This blood is still steaming\xe2\x80\x94it was driven by a human heart!\r\nAlmighty God! and this goes on\xe2\x80\x94it is systematic, organized,\r\npremeditated! And we know it, and read of it, and take it for granted;\r\nour papers tell of it, and the presses are not stopped\xe2\x80\x94our churches\r\nknow of it, and do not close their doors\xe2\x80\x94the people behold it, and do\r\nnot rise up in horror and revolution!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr perhaps Manchuria is too far away for you\xe2\x80\x94come home with me then,\r\ncome here to Chicago. Here in this city to-night ten thousand women are\r\nshut up in foul pens, and driven by hunger to sell their bodies to\r\nlive. And we know it, we make it a jest! And these women are made in\r\nthe image of your mothers, they may be your sisters, your daughters;\r\nthe child whom you left at home tonight, whose laughing eyes will greet\r\nyou in the morning\xe2\x80\x94that fate may be waiting for her! To-night in\r\nChicago there are ten thousand men, homeless and wretched, willing to\r\nwork and begging for a chance, yet starving, and fronting in terror the\r\nawful winter cold! Tonight in Chicago there are a hundred thousand\r\nchildren wearing out their strength and blasting their lives in the\r\neffort to earn their bread! There are a hundred thousand mothers who\r\nare living in misery and squalor, struggling to earn enough to feed\r\ntheir little ones! There are a hundred thousand old people, cast off\r\nand helpless, waiting for death to take them from their torments! There\r\nare a million people, men and women and children, who share the curse\r\nof the wage-slave; who toil every hour they can stand and see, for just\r\nenough to keep them alive; who are condemned till the end of their days\r\nto monotony and weariness, to hunger and misery, to heat and cold, to\r\ndirt and disease, to ignorance and drunkenness and vice! And then turn\r\nover the page with me, and gaze upon the other side of the picture.\r\nThere are a thousand\xe2\x80\x94ten thousand, maybe\xe2\x80\x94who are the masters of these\r\nslaves, who own their toil. They do nothing to earn what they receive,\r\nthey do not even have to ask for it\xe2\x80\x94it comes to them of itself, their\r\nonly care is to dispose of it. They live in palaces, they riot in\r\nluxury and extravagance\xe2\x80\x94such as no words can describe, as makes the\r\nimagination reel and stagger, makes the soul grow sick and faint. They\r\nspend hundreds of dollars for a pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a\r\ngarter; they spend millions for horses and automobiles and yachts, for\r\npalaces and banquets, for little shiny stones with which to deck their\r\nbodies. Their life is a contest among themselves for supremacy in\r\nostentation and recklessness, in the destroying of useful and necessary\r\nthings, in the wasting of the labor and the lives of their fellow\r\ncreatures, the toil and anguish of the nations, the sweat and tears and\r\nblood of the human race! It is all theirs\xe2\x80\x94it comes to them; just as all\r\nthe springs pour into streamlets, and the streamlets into rivers, and\r\nthe rivers into the oceans\xe2\x80\x94so, automatically and inevitably, all the\r\nwealth of society comes to them. The farmer tills the soil, the miner\r\ndigs in the earth, the weaver tends the loom, the mason carves the\r\nstone; the clever man invents, the shrewd man directs, the wise man\r\nstudies, the inspired man sings\xe2\x80\x94and all the result, the products of the\r\nlabor of brain and muscle, are gathered into one stupendous stream and\r\npoured into their laps! The whole of society is in their grip, the\r\nwhole labor of the world lies at their mercy\xe2\x80\x94and like fierce wolves\r\nthey rend and destroy, like ravening vultures they devour and tear! The\r\nwhole power of mankind belongs to them, forever and beyond recall\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nwhat it can, strive as it will, humanity lives for them and dies for\r\nthem! They own not merely the labor of society, they have bought the\r\ngovernments; and everywhere they use their raped and stolen power to\r\nintrench themselves in their privileges, to dig wider and deeper the\r\nchannels through which the river of profits flows to them!\xe2\x80\x94And you,\r\nworkingmen, workingmen! You have been brought up to it, you plod on\r\nlike beasts of burden, thinking only of the day and its pain\xe2\x80\x94yet is\r\nthere a man among you who can believe that such a system will continue\r\nforever\xe2\x80\x94is there a man here in this audience tonight so hardened and\r\ndebased that he dare rise up before me and say that he believes it can\r\ncontinue forever; that the product of the labor of society, the means\r\nof existence of the human race, will always belong to idlers and\r\nparasites, to be spent for the gratification of vanity and lust\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nspent for any purpose whatever, to be at the disposal of any individual\r\nwill whatever\xe2\x80\x94that somehow, somewhere, the labor of humanity will not\r\nbelong to humanity, to be used for the purposes of humanity, to be\r\ncontrolled by the will of humanity? And if this is ever to be, how is\r\nit to be\xe2\x80\x94what power is there that will bring it about? Will it be the\r\ntask of your masters, do you think\xe2\x80\x94will they write the charter of your\r\nliberties? Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they\r\nmarshal you the army and lead it to the fray? Will their wealth be\r\nspent for the purpose\xe2\x80\x94will they build colleges and churches to teach\r\nyou, will they print papers to herald your progress, and organize\r\npolitical parties to guide and carry on the struggle? Can you not see\r\nthat the task is your task\xe2\x80\x94yours to dream, yours to resolve, yours to\r\nexecute? That if ever it is carried out, it will be in the face of\r\nevery obstacle that wealth and mastership can oppose\xe2\x80\x94in the face of\r\nridicule and slander, of hatred and persecution, of the bludgeon and\r\nthe jail? That it will be by the power of your naked bosoms, opposed to\r\nthe rage of oppression! By the grim and bitter teaching of blind and\r\nmerciless affliction! By the painful gropings of the untutored mind, by\r\nthe feeble stammerings of the uncultured voice! By the sad and lonely\r\nhunger of the spirit; by seeking and striving and yearning, by\r\nheartache and despairing, by agony and sweat of blood! It will be by\r\nmoney paid for with hunger, by knowledge stolen from sleep, by thoughts\r\ncommunicated under the shadow of the gallows! It will be a movement\r\nbeginning in the far-off past, a thing obscure and unhonored, a thing\r\neasy to ridicule, easy to despise; a thing unlovely, wearing the aspect\r\nof vengeance and hate\xe2\x80\x94but to you, the working-man, the wage-slave,\r\ncalling with a voice insistent, imperious\xe2\x80\x94with a voice that you cannot\r\nescape, wherever upon the earth you may be! With the voice of all your\r\nwrongs, with the voice of all your desires; with the voice of your duty\r\nand your hope\xe2\x80\x94of everything in the world that is worth while to you!\r\nThe voice of the poor, demanding that poverty shall cease! The voice of\r\nthe oppressed, pronouncing the doom of oppression! The voice of power,\r\nwrought out of suffering\xe2\x80\x94of resolution, crushed out of weakness\xe2\x80\x94of joy\r\nand courage, born in the bottomless pit of anguish and despair! The\r\nvoice of Labor, despised and outraged; a mighty giant, lying\r\nprostrate\xe2\x80\x94mountainous, colossal, but blinded, bound, and ignorant of\r\nhis strength. And now a dream of resistance haunts him, hope battling\r\nwith fear; until suddenly he stirs, and a fetter snaps\xe2\x80\x94and a thrill\r\nshoots through him, to the farthest ends of his huge body, and in a\r\nflash the dream becomes an act! He starts, he lifts himself; and the\r\nbands are shattered, the burdens roll off him\xe2\x80\x94he rises\xe2\x80\x94towering,\r\ngigantic; he springs to his feet, he shouts in his newborn exultation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice broke suddenly, with the stress of his\r\nfeelings; he stood with his arms stretched out above him, and the power\r\nof his vision seemed to lift him from the floor. The audience came to\r\nits feet with a yell; men waved their arms, laughing aloud in their\r\nexcitement. And Jurgis was with them, he was shouting to tear his\r\nthroat; shouting because he could not help it, because the stress of\r\nhis feeling was more than he could bear. It was not merely the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords, the torrent of his eloquence. It was his presence, it was his\r\nvoice: a voice with strange intonations that rang through the chambers\r\nof the soul like the clanging of a bell\xe2\x80\x94that gripped the listener like\r\na mighty hand about his body, that shook him and startled him with\r\nsudden fright, with a sense of things not of earth, of mysteries never\r\nspoken before, of presences of awe and terror! There was an unfolding\r\nof vistas before him, a breaking of the ground beneath him, an\r\nupheaving, a stirring, a trembling; he felt himself suddenly a mere man\r\nno longer\xe2\x80\x94there were powers within him undreamed of, there were demon\r\nforces contending, age-long wonders struggling to be born; and he sat\r\noppressed with pain and joy, while a tingling stole down into his\r\nfinger tips, and his breath came hard and fast. The sentences of this\r\nman were to Jurgis like the crashing of thunder in his soul; a flood of\r\nemotions surged up in him\xe2\x80\x94all his old hopes and longings, his old\r\ngriefs and rages and despairs. All that he had ever felt in his whole\r\nlife seemed to come back to him at once, and with one new emotion,\r\nhardly to be described. That he should have suffered such oppressions\r\nand such horrors was bad enough; but that he should have been crushed\r\nand beaten by them, that he should have submitted, and forgotten, and\r\nlived in peace\xe2\x80\x94ah, truly that was a thing not to be put into words, a\r\nthing not to be borne by a human creature, a thing of terror and\r\nmadness! \xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d asks the prophet, \xe2\x80\x9cis the murder of them that kill the\r\nbody, to the murder of them that kill the soul?\xe2\x80\x9d And Jurgis was a man\r\nwhose soul had been murdered, who had ceased to hope and to\r\nstruggle\xe2\x80\x94who had made terms with degradation and despair; and now,\r\nsuddenly, in one awful convulsion, the black and hideous fact was made\r\nplain to him! There was a falling in of all the pillars of his soul,\r\nthe sky seemed to split above him\xe2\x80\x94he stood there, with his clenched\r\nhands upraised, his eyes bloodshot, and the veins standing out purple\r\nin his face, roaring in the voice of a wild beast, frantic, incoherent,\r\nmaniacal. And when he could shout no more he still stood there,\r\ngasping, and whispering hoarsely to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cBy God! By God! By God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man had gone back to a seat upon the platform, and Jurgis realized\r\nthat his speech was over. The applause continued for several minutes;\r\nand then some one started a song, and the crowd took it up, and the\r\nplace shook with it. Jurgis had never heard it, and he could not make\r\nout the words, but the wild and wonderful spirit of it seized upon\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94it was the \xe2\x80\x9cMarseillaise!\xe2\x80\x9d As stanza after stanza of it thundered\r\nforth, he sat with his hands clasped, trembling in every nerve. He had\r\nnever been so stirred in his life\xe2\x80\x94it was a miracle that had been\r\nwrought in him. He could not think at all, he was stunned; yet he knew\r\nthat in the mighty upheaval that had taken place in his soul, a new man\r\nhad been born. He had been torn out of the jaws of destruction, he had\r\nbeen delivered from the thraldom of despair; the whole world had been\r\nchanged for him\xe2\x80\x94he was free, he was free! Even if he were to suffer as\r\nhe had before, even if he were to beg and starve, nothing would be the\r\nsame to him; he would understand it, and bear it. He would no longer be\r\nthe sport of circumstances, he would be a man, with a will and a\r\npurpose; he would have something to fight for, something to die for, if\r\nneed be! Here were men who would show him and help him; and he would\r\nhave friends and allies, he would dwell in the sight of justice, and\r\nwalk arm in arm with power.\r\n\r\nThe audience subsided again, and Jurgis sat back. The chairman of the\r\nmeeting came forward and began to speak. His voice sounded thin and\r\nfutile after the other\xe2\x80\x99s, and to Jurgis it seemed a profanation. Why\r\nshould any one else speak, after that miraculous man\xe2\x80\x94why should they\r\nnot all sit in silence? The chairman was explaining that a collection\r\nwould now be taken up to defray the expenses of the meeting, and for\r\nthe benefit of the campaign fund of the party. Jurgis heard; but he had\r\nnot a penny to give, and so his thoughts went elsewhere again.\r\n\r\nHe kept his eyes fixed on the orator, who sat in an armchair, his head\r\nleaning on his hand and his attitude indicating exhaustion. But\r\nsuddenly he stood up again, and Jurgis heard the chairman of the\r\nmeeting saying that the speaker would now answer any questions which\r\nthe audience might care to put to him. The man came forward, and some\r\none\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x94arose and asked about some opinion the speaker had\r\nexpressed concerning Tolstoy. Jurgis had never heard of Tolstoy, and\r\ndid not care anything about him. Why should any one want to ask such\r\nquestions, after an address like that? The thing was not to talk, but\r\nto do; the thing was to get bold of others and rouse them, to organize\r\nthem and prepare for the fight! But still the discussion went on, in\r\nordinary conversational tones, and it brought Jurgis back to the\r\neveryday world. A few minutes ago he had felt like seizing the hand of\r\nthe beautiful lady by his side, and kissing it; he had felt like\r\nflinging his arms about the neck of the man on the other side of him.\r\nAnd now he began to realize again that he was a \xe2\x80\x9chobo,\xe2\x80\x9d that he was\r\nragged and dirty, and smelled bad, and had no place to sleep that\r\nnight!\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last, when the meeting broke up, and the audience started to\r\nleave, poor Jurgis was in an agony of uncertainty. He had not thought\r\nof leaving\xe2\x80\x94he had thought that the vision must last forever, that he\r\nhad found comrades and brothers. But now he would go out, and the thing\r\nwould fade away, and he would never be able to find it again! He sat in\r\nhis seat, frightened and wondering; but others in the same row wanted\r\nto get out, and so he had to stand up and move along. As he was swept\r\ndown the aisle he looked from one person to another, wistfully; they\r\nwere all excitedly discussing the address\xe2\x80\x94but there was nobody who\r\noffered to discuss it with him. He was near enough to the door to feel\r\nthe night air, when desperation seized him. He knew nothing at all\r\nabout that speech he had heard, not even the name of the orator; and he\r\nwas to go away\xe2\x80\x94no, no, it was preposterous, he must speak to some one;\r\nhe must find that man himself and tell him. He would not despise him,\r\ntramp as he was!\r\n\r\nSo he stepped into an empty row of seats and watched, and when the\r\ncrowd had thinned out, he started toward the platform. The speaker was\r\ngone; but there was a stage door that stood open, with people passing\r\nin and out, and no one on guard. Jurgis summoned up his courage and\r\nwent in, and down a hallway, and to the door of a room where many\r\npeople were crowded. No one paid any attention to him, and he pushed\r\nin, and in a corner he saw the man he sought. The orator sat in a\r\nchair, with his shoulders sunk together and his eyes half closed; his\r\nface was ghastly pale, almost greenish in hue, and one arm lay limp at\r\nhis side. A big man with spectacles on stood near him, and kept pushing\r\nback the crowd, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cStand away a little, please; can\xe2\x80\x99t you see the\r\ncomrade is worn out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis stood watching, while five or ten minutes passed. Now and\r\nthen the man would look up, and address a word or two to those who were\r\nnear him; and, at last, on one of these occasions, his glance rested on\r\nJurgis. There seemed to be a slight hint of inquiry about it, and a\r\nsudden impulse seized the other. He stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to thank you, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he began, in breathless haste. \xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nnot go away without telling you how much\xe2\x80\x94how glad I am I heard you. I\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe big man with the spectacles, who had moved away, came back at this\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe comrade is too tired to talk to any one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began; but\r\nthe other held up his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has something to say to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he looked\r\ninto Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know more about Socialism?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nJurgis started. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it Socialism? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\r\nwant to know about what you spoke of\xe2\x80\x94I want to help. I have been\r\nthrough all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cI am out of work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a foreigner, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLithuanian, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man thought for a moment, and then turned to his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is\r\nthere, Walters?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is Ostrinski\xe2\x80\x94but he is a Pole\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOstrinski speaks Lithuanian,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then; would\r\nyou mind seeing if he has gone yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other started away, and the speaker looked at Jurgis again. He had\r\ndeep, black eyes, and a face full of gentleness and pain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nexcuse me, comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am just tired out\xe2\x80\x94I have spoken every\r\nday for the last month. I will introduce you to some one who will be\r\nable to help you as well as I could\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe messenger had had to go no further than the door, he came back,\r\nfollowed by a man whom he introduced to Jurgis as \xe2\x80\x9cComrade Ostrinski.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nComrade Ostrinski was a little man, scarcely up to Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\nwizened and wrinkled, very ugly, and slightly lame. He had on a\r\nlong-tailed black coat, worn green at the seams and the buttonholes;\r\nhis eyes must have been weak, for he wore green spectacles that gave\r\nhim a grotesque appearance. But his handclasp was hearty, and he spoke\r\nin Lithuanian, which warmed Jurgis to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know about Socialism?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely. Let us go out and\r\ntake a stroll, where we can be quiet and talk some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis bade farewell to the master wizard, and went out.\r\nOstrinski asked where he lived, offering to walk in that direction; and\r\nso he had to explain once more that he was without a home. At the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s request he told his story; how he had come to America, and what\r\nhad happened to him in the stockyards, and how his family had been\r\nbroken up, and how he had become a wanderer. So much the little man\r\nheard, and then he pressed Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s arm tightly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been through\r\nthe mill, comrade!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will make a fighter out of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Ostrinski in turn explained his circumstances. He would have asked\r\nJurgis to his home\xe2\x80\x94but he had only two rooms, and had no bed to offer.\r\nHe would have given up his own bed, but his wife was ill. Later on,\r\nwhen he understood that otherwise Jurgis would have to sleep in a\r\nhallway, he offered him his kitchen floor, a chance which the other was\r\nonly too glad to accept. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps tomorrow we can do better,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nOstrinski. \xe2\x80\x9cWe try not to let a comrade starve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOstrinski\xe2\x80\x99s home was in the Ghetto district, where he had two rooms in\r\nthe basement of a tenement. There was a baby crying as they entered,\r\nand he closed the door leading into the bedroom. He had three young\r\nchildren, he explained, and a baby had just come. He drew up two chairs\r\nnear the kitchen stove, adding that Jurgis must excuse the disorder of\r\nthe place, since at such a time one\xe2\x80\x99s domestic arrangements were upset.\r\nHalf of the kitchen was given up to a workbench, which was piled with\r\nclothing, and Ostrinski explained that he was a \xe2\x80\x9cpants finisher.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nbrought great bundles of clothing here to his home, where he and his\r\nwife worked on them. He made a living at it, but it was getting harder\r\nall the time, because his eyes were failing. What would come when they\r\ngave out he could not tell; there had been no saving anything\xe2\x80\x94a man\r\ncould barely keep alive by twelve or fourteen hours\xe2\x80\x99 work a day. The\r\nfinishing of pants did not take much skill, and anybody could learn it,\r\nand so the pay was forever getting less. That was the competitive wage\r\nsystem; and if Jurgis wanted to understand what Socialism was, it was\r\nthere he had best begin. The workers were dependent upon a job to exist\r\nfrom day to day, and so they bid against each other, and no man could\r\nget more than the lowest man would consent to work for. And thus the\r\nmass of the people were always in a life-and-death struggle with\r\npoverty. That was \xe2\x80\x9ccompetition,\xe2\x80\x9d so far as it concerned the\r\nwage-earner, the man who had only his labor to sell; to those on top,\r\nthe exploiters, it appeared very differently, of course\xe2\x80\x94there were few\r\nof them, and they could combine and dominate, and their power would be\r\nunbreakable. And so all over the world two classes were forming, with\r\nan unbridged chasm between them\xe2\x80\x94the capitalist class, with its enormous\r\nfortunes, and the proletariat, bound into slavery by unseen chains. The\r\nlatter were a thousand to one in numbers, but they were ignorant and\r\nhelpless, and they would remain at the mercy of their exploiters until\r\nthey were organized\xe2\x80\x94until they had become \xe2\x80\x9cclass-conscious.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a\r\nslow and weary process, but it would go on\xe2\x80\x94it was like the movement of\r\na glacier, once it was started it could never be stopped. Every\r\nSocialist did his share, and lived upon the vision of the \xe2\x80\x9cgood time\r\ncoming,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94when the working class should go to the polls and seize the\r\npowers of government, and put an end to private property in the means\r\nof production. No matter how poor a man was, or how much he suffered,\r\nhe could never be really unhappy while he knew of that future; even if\r\nhe did not live to see it himself, his children would, and, to a\r\nSocialist, the victory of his class was his victory. Also he had always\r\nthe progress to encourage him; here in Chicago, for instance, the\r\nmovement was growing by leaps and bounds. Chicago was the industrial\r\ncenter of the country, and nowhere else were the unions so strong; but\r\ntheir organizations did the workers little good, for the employers were\r\norganized, also; and so the strikes generally failed, and as fast as\r\nthe unions were broken up the men were coming over to the Socialists.\r\n\r\nOstrinski explained the organization of the party, the machinery by\r\nwhich the proletariat was educating itself. There were \xe2\x80\x9clocals\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nevery big city and town, and they were being organized rapidly in the\r\nsmaller places; a local had anywhere from six to a thousand members,\r\nand there were fourteen hundred of them in all, with a total of about\r\ntwenty-five thousand members, who paid dues to support the\r\norganization. \xe2\x80\x9cLocal Cook County,\xe2\x80\x9d as the city organization was called,\r\nhad eighty branch locals, and it alone was spending several thousand\r\ndollars in the campaign. It published a weekly in English, and one each\r\nin Bohemian and German; also there was a monthly published in Chicago,\r\nand a cooperative publishing house, that issued a million and a half of\r\nSocialist books and pamphlets every year. All this was the growth of\r\nthe last few years\xe2\x80\x94there had been almost nothing of it when Ostrinski\r\nfirst came to Chicago.\r\n\r\nOstrinski was a Pole, about fifty years of age. He had lived in\r\nSilesia, a member of a despised and persecuted race, and had taken part\r\nin the proletarian movement in the early seventies, when Bismarck,\r\nhaving conquered France, had turned his policy of blood and iron upon\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cInternational.\xe2\x80\x9d Ostrinski himself had twice been in jail, but he\r\nhad been young then, and had not cared. He had had more of his share of\r\nthe fight, though, for just when Socialism had broken all its barriers\r\nand become the great political force of the empire, he had come to\r\nAmerica, and begun all over again. In America every one had laughed at\r\nthe mere idea of Socialism then\xe2\x80\x94in America all men were free. As if\r\npolitical liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable! said\r\nOstrinski.\r\n\r\nThe little tailor sat tilted back in his stiff kitchen chair, with his\r\nfeet stretched out upon the empty stove, and speaking in low whispers,\r\nso as not to waken those in the next room. To Jurgis he seemed a\r\nscarcely less wonderful person than the speaker at the meeting; he was\r\npoor, the lowest of the low, hunger-driven and miserable\xe2\x80\x94and yet how\r\nmuch he knew, how much he had dared and achieved, what a hero he had\r\nbeen! There were others like him, too\xe2\x80\x94thousands like him, and all of\r\nthem workingmen! That all this wonderful machinery of progress had been\r\ncreated by his fellows\xe2\x80\x94Jurgis could not believe it, it seemed too good\r\nto be true.\r\n\r\nThat was always the way, said Ostrinski; when a man was first converted\r\nto Socialism he was like a crazy person\xe2\x80\x94he could not understand how\r\nothers could fail to see it, and he expected to convert all the world\r\nthe first week. After a while he would realize how hard a task it was;\r\nand then it would be fortunate that other new hands kept coming, to\r\nsave him from settling down into a rut. Just now Jurgis would have\r\nplenty of chance to vent his excitement, for a presidential campaign\r\nwas on, and everybody was talking politics. Ostrinski would take him to\r\nthe next meeting of the branch local, and introduce him, and he might\r\njoin the party. The dues were five cents a week, but any one who could\r\nnot afford this might be excused from paying. The Socialist party was a\r\nreally democratic political organization\xe2\x80\x94it was controlled absolutely\r\nby its own membership, and had no bosses. All of these things Ostrinski\r\nexplained, as also the principles of the party. You might say that\r\nthere was really but one Socialist principle\xe2\x80\x94that of \xe2\x80\x9cno compromise,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich was the essence of the proletarian movement all over the world.\r\nWhen a Socialist was elected to office he voted with old party\r\nlegislators for any measure that was likely to be of help to the\r\nworking class, but he never forgot that these concessions, whatever\r\nthey might be, were trifles compared with the great purpose\xe2\x80\x94the\r\norganizing of the working class for the revolution. So far, the rule in\r\nAmerica had been that one Socialist made another Socialist once every\r\ntwo years; and if they should maintain the same rate they would carry\r\nthe country in 1912\xe2\x80\x94though not all of them expected to succeed as\r\nquickly as that.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists were organized in every civilized nation; it was an\r\ninternational political party, said Ostrinski, the greatest the world\r\nhad ever known. It numbered thirty million of adherents, and it cast\r\neight million votes. It had started its first newspaper in Japan, and\r\nelected its first deputy in Argentina; in France it named members of\r\ncabinets, and in Italy and Australia it held the balance of power and\r\nturned out ministries. In Germany, where its vote was more than a third\r\nof the total vote of the empire, all other parties and powers had\r\nunited to fight it. It would not do, Ostrinski explained, for the\r\nproletariat of one nation to achieve the victory, for that nation would\r\nbe crushed by the military power of the others; and so the Socialist\r\nmovement was a world movement, an organization of all mankind to\r\nestablish liberty and fraternity. It was the new religion of\r\nhumanity\xe2\x80\x94or you might say it was the fulfillment of the old religion,\r\nsince it implied but the literal application of all the teachings of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nUntil long after midnight Jurgis sat lost in the conversation of his\r\nnew acquaintance. It was a most wonderful experience to him\xe2\x80\x94an almost\r\nsupernatural experience. It was like encountering an inhabitant of the\r\nfourth dimension of space, a being who was free from all one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nlimitations. For four years, now, Jurgis had been wondering and\r\nblundering in the depths of a wilderness; and here, suddenly, a hand\r\nreached down and seized him, and lifted him out of it, and set him upon\r\na mountain-top, from which he could survey it all\xe2\x80\x94could see the paths\r\nfrom which he had wandered, the morasses into which he had stumbled,\r\nthe hiding places of the beasts of prey that had fallen upon him. There\r\nwere his Packingtown experiences, for instance\xe2\x80\x94what was there about\r\nPackingtown that Ostrinski could not explain! To Jurgis the packers had\r\nbeen equivalent to fate; Ostrinski showed him that they were the Beef\r\nTrust. They were a gigantic combination of capital, which had crushed\r\nall opposition, and overthrown the laws of the land, and was preying\r\nupon the people. Jurgis recollected how, when he had first come to\r\nPackingtown, he had stood and watched the hog-killing, and thought how\r\ncruel and savage it was, and come away congratulating himself that he\r\nwas not a hog; now his new acquaintance showed him that a hog was just\r\nwhat he had been\xe2\x80\x94one of the packers\xe2\x80\x99 hogs. What they wanted from a hog\r\nwas all the profits that could be got out of him; and that was what\r\nthey wanted from the workingman, and also that was what they wanted\r\nfrom the public. What the hog thought of it, and what he suffered, were\r\nnot considered; and no more was it with labor, and no more with the\r\npurchaser of meat. That was true everywhere in the world, but it was\r\nespecially true in Packingtown; there seemed to be something about the\r\nwork of slaughtering that tended to ruthlessness and ferocity\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nliterally the fact that in the methods of the packers a hundred human\r\nlives did not balance a penny of profit. When Jurgis had made himself\r\nfamiliar with the Socialist literature, as he would very quickly, he\r\nwould get glimpses of the Beef Trust from all sorts of aspects, and he\r\nwould find it everywhere the same; it was the incarnation of blind and\r\ninsensate Greed. It was a monster devouring with a thousand mouths,\r\ntrampling with a thousand hoofs; it was the Great Butcher\xe2\x80\x94it was the\r\nspirit of Capitalism made flesh. Upon the ocean of commerce it sailed\r\nas a pirate ship; it had hoisted the black flag and declared war upon\r\ncivilization. Bribery and corruption were its everyday methods. In\r\nChicago the city government was simply one of its branch offices; it\r\nstole billions of gallons of city water openly, it dictated to the\r\ncourts the sentences of disorderly strikers, it forbade the mayor to\r\nenforce the building laws against it. In the national capital it had\r\npower to prevent inspection of its product, and to falsify government\r\nreports; it violated the rebate laws, and when an investigation was\r\nthreatened it burned its books and sent its criminal agents out of the\r\ncountry. In the commercial world it was a Juggernaut car; it wiped out\r\nthousands of businesses every year, it drove men to madness and\r\nsuicide. It had forced the price of cattle so low as to destroy the\r\nstock-raising industry, an occupation upon which whole states existed;\r\nit had ruined thousands of butchers who had refused to handle its\r\nproducts. It divided the country into districts, and fixed the price of\r\nmeat in all of them; and it owned all the refrigerator cars, and levied\r\nan enormous tribute upon all poultry and eggs and fruit and vegetables.\r\nWith the millions of dollars a week that poured in upon it, it was\r\nreaching out for the control of other interests, railroads and trolley\r\nlines, gas and electric light franchises\xe2\x80\x94it already owned the leather\r\nand the grain business of the country. The people were tremendously\r\nstirred up over its encroachments, but nobody had any remedy to\r\nsuggest; it was the task of Socialists to teach and organize them, and\r\nprepare them for the time when they were to seize the huge machine\r\ncalled the Beef Trust, and use it to produce food for human beings and\r\nnot to heap up fortunes for a band of pirates. It was long after\r\nmidnight when Jurgis lay down upon the floor of Ostrinski\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen;\r\nand yet it was an hour before he could get to sleep, for the glory of\r\nthat joyful vision of the people of Packingtown marching in and taking\r\npossession of the Union Stockyards!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nJurgis had breakfast with Ostrinski and his family, and then he went\r\nhome to Elzbieta. He was no longer shy about it\xe2\x80\x94when he went in,\r\ninstead of saying all the things he had been planning to say, he\r\nstarted to tell Elzbieta about the revolution! At first she thought he\r\nwas out of his mind, and it was hours before she could really feel\r\ncertain that he was himself. When, however, she had satisfied herself\r\nthat he was sane upon all subjects except politics, she troubled\r\nherself no further about it. Jurgis was destined to find that\r\nElzbieta\xe2\x80\x99s armor was absolutely impervious to Socialism. Her soul had\r\nbeen baked hard in the fire of adversity, and there was no altering it\r\nnow; life to her was the hunt for daily bread, and ideas existed for\r\nher only as they bore upon that. All that interested her in regard to\r\nthis new frenzy which had seized hold of her son-in-law was whether or\r\nnot it had a tendency to make him sober and industrious; and when she\r\nfound he intended to look for work and to contribute his share to the\r\nfamily fund, she gave him full rein to convince her of anything. A\r\nwonderfully wise little woman was Elzbieta; she could think as quickly\r\nas a hunted rabbit, and in half an hour she had chosen her\r\nlife-attitude to the Socialist movement. She agreed in everything with\r\nJurgis, except the need of his paying his dues; and she would even go\r\nto a meeting with him now and then, and sit and plan her next day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndinner amid the storm.\r\n\r\nFor a week after he became a convert Jurgis continued to wander about\r\nall day, looking for work; until at last he met with a strange fortune.\r\nHe was passing one of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s innumerable small hotels, and after\r\nsome hesitation he concluded to go in. A man he took for the proprietor\r\nwas standing in the lobby, and he went up to him and tackled him for a\r\njob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d the man asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, and added quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been out of work\r\nfor a long time, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m an honest man, and I\xe2\x80\x99m strong and willing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other was eying him narrowly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you drink?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been employing a man as a porter, and he drinks. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndischarged him seven times now, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve about made up my mind that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough. Would you be a porter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard work. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to clean floors and wash spittoons and\r\nfill lamps and handle trunks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you thirty a month and board, and you can begin\r\nnow, if you feel like it. You can put on the other fellow\xe2\x80\x99s rig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so Jurgis fell to work, and toiled like a Trojan till night. Then\r\nhe went and told Elzbieta, and also, late as it was, he paid a visit to\r\nOstrinski to let him know of his good fortune. Here he received a great\r\nsurprise, for when he was describing the location of the hotel\r\nOstrinski interrupted suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cNot Hinds\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jurgis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the other replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best boss in\r\nChicago\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a state organizer of our party, and one of our best-known\r\nspeakers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the next morning Jurgis went to his employer and told him; and the\r\nman seized him by the hand and shook it. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nlets me out. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep all last night because I had discharged a\r\ngood Socialist!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, after that, Jurgis was known to his \xe2\x80\x9cboss\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cComrade Jurgis,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nin return he was expected to call him \xe2\x80\x9cComrade Hinds.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTommy\xe2\x80\x9d Hinds,\r\nas he was known to his intimates, was a squat little man, with broad\r\nshoulders and a florid face, decorated with gray side whiskers. He was\r\nthe kindest-hearted man that ever lived, and the\r\nliveliest\xe2\x80\x94inexhaustible in his enthusiasm, and talking Socialism all\r\nday and all night. He was a great fellow to jolly along a crowd, and\r\nwould keep a meeting in an uproar; when once he got really waked up,\r\nthe torrent of his eloquence could be compared with nothing save\r\nNiagara.\r\n\r\nTommy Hinds had begun life as a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s helper, and had run away\r\nto join the Union army, where he had made his first acquaintance with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgraft,\xe2\x80\x9d in the shape of rotten muskets and shoddy blankets. To a\r\nmusket that broke in a crisis he always attributed the death of his\r\nonly brother, and upon worthless blankets he blamed all the agonies of\r\nhis own old age. Whenever it rained, the rheumatism would get into his\r\njoints, and then he would screw up his face and mutter: \xe2\x80\x9cCapitalism, my\r\nboy, capitalism! \xe2\x80\x98_\xc3\x89crasez l\xe2\x80\x99Inf\xc3\xa2me!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He had one unfailing remedy for\r\nall the evils of this world, and he preached it to every one; no matter\r\nwhether the person\xe2\x80\x99s trouble was failure in business, or dyspepsia, or\r\na quarrelsome mother-in-law, a twinkle would come into his eyes and he\r\nwould say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what to do about it\xe2\x80\x94vote the Socialist ticket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTommy Hinds had set out upon the trail of the Octopus as soon as the\r\nwar was over. He had gone into business, and found himself in\r\ncompetition with the fortunes of those who had been stealing while he\r\nhad been fighting. The city government was in their hands and the\r\nrailroads were in league with them, and honest business was driven to\r\nthe wall; and so Hinds had put all his savings into Chicago real\r\nestate, and set out singlehanded to dam the river of graft. He had been\r\na reform member of the city council, he had been a Greenbacker, a Labor\r\nUnionist, a Populist, a Bryanite\xe2\x80\x94and after thirty years of fighting,\r\nthe year 1896 had served to convince him that the power of concentrated\r\nwealth could never be controlled, but could only be destroyed. He had\r\npublished a pamphlet about it, and set out to organize a party of his\r\nown, when a stray Socialist leaflet had revealed to him that others had\r\nbeen ahead of him. Now for eight years he had been fighting for the\r\nparty, anywhere, everywhere\xe2\x80\x94whether it was a G.A.R. reunion, or a\r\nhotel-keepers\xe2\x80\x99 convention, or an Afro-American business-men\xe2\x80\x99s banquet,\r\nor a Bible society picnic, Tommy Hinds would manage to get himself\r\ninvited to explain the relations of Socialism to the subject in hand.\r\nAfter that he would start off upon a tour of his own, ending at some\r\nplace between New York and Oregon; and when he came back from there, he\r\nwould go out to organize new locals for the state committee; and\r\nfinally he would come home to rest\xe2\x80\x94and talk Socialism in Chicago.\r\nHinds\xe2\x80\x99s hotel was a very hot-bed of the propaganda; all the employees\r\nwere party men, and if they were not when they came, they were quite\r\ncertain to be before they went away. The proprietor would get into a\r\ndiscussion with some one in the lobby, and as the conversation grew\r\nanimated, others would gather about to listen, until finally every one\r\nin the place would be crowded into a group, and a regular debate would\r\nbe under way. This went on every night\xe2\x80\x94when Tommy Hinds was not there\r\nto do it, his clerk did it; and when his clerk was away campaigning,\r\nthe assistant attended to it, while Mrs. Hinds sat behind the desk and\r\ndid the work. The clerk was an old crony of the proprietor\xe2\x80\x99s, an\r\nawkward, rawboned giant of a man, with a lean, sallow face, a broad\r\nmouth, and whiskers under his chin, the very type and body of a prairie\r\nfarmer. He had been that all his life\xe2\x80\x94he had fought the railroads in\r\nKansas for fifty years, a Granger, a Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance man, a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmiddle-of-the-road\xe2\x80\x9d Populist. Finally, Tommy Hinds had revealed to him\r\nthe wonderful idea of using the trusts instead of destroying them, and\r\nhe had sold his farm and come to Chicago.\r\n\r\nThat was Amos Struver; and then there was Harry Adams, the assistant\r\nclerk, a pale, scholarly-looking man, who came from Massachusetts, of\r\nPilgrim stock. Adams had been a cotton operative in Fall River, and the\r\ncontinued depression in the industry had worn him and his family out,\r\nand he had emigrated to South Carolina. In Massachusetts the percentage\r\nof white illiteracy is eight-tenths of one per cent, while in South\r\nCarolina it is thirteen and six-tenths per cent; also in South Carolina\r\nthere is a property qualification for voters\xe2\x80\x94and for these and other\r\nreasons child labor is the rule, and so the cotton mills were driving\r\nthose of Massachusetts out of the business. Adams did not know this, he\r\nonly knew that the Southern mills were running; but when he got there\r\nhe found that if he was to live, all his family would have to work, and\r\nfrom six o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night to six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. So he had set\r\nto work to organize the mill hands, after the fashion in Massachusetts,\r\nand had been discharged; but he had gotten other work, and stuck at it,\r\nand at last there had been a strike for shorter hours, and Harry Adams\r\nhad attempted to address a street meeting, which was the end of him. In\r\nthe states of the far South the labor of convicts is leased to\r\ncontractors, and when there are not convicts enough they have to be\r\nsupplied. Harry Adams was sent up by a judge who was a cousin of the\r\nmill owner with whose business he had interfered; and though the life\r\nhad nearly killed him, he had been wise enough not to murmur, and at\r\nthe end of his term he and his family had left the state of South\r\nCarolina\xe2\x80\x94hell\xe2\x80\x99s back yard, as he called it. He had no money for\r\ncarfare, but it was harvest-time, and they walked one day and worked\r\nthe next; and so Adams got at last to Chicago, and joined the Socialist\r\nparty. He was a studious man, reserved, and nothing of an orator; but\r\nhe always had a pile of books under his desk in the hotel, and articles\r\nfrom his pen were beginning to attract attention in the party press.\r\n\r\nContrary to what one would have expected, all this radicalism did not\r\nhurt the hotel business; the radicals flocked to it, and the commercial\r\ntravelers all found it diverting. Of late, also, the hotel had become a\r\nfavorite stopping place for Western cattlemen. Now that the Beef Trust\r\nhad adopted the trick of raising prices to induce enormous shipments of\r\ncattle, and then dropping them again and scooping in all they needed, a\r\nstock raiser was very apt to find himself in Chicago without money\r\nenough to pay his freight bill; and so he had to go to a cheap hotel,\r\nand it was no drawback to him if there was an agitator talking in the\r\nlobby. These Western fellows were just \xe2\x80\x9cmeat\xe2\x80\x9d for Tommy Hinds\xe2\x80\x94he would\r\nget a dozen of them around him and paint little pictures of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nSystem.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course, it was not a week before he had heard Jurgis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstory, and after that he would not have let his new porter go for the\r\nworld. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, in the middle of an argument, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a fellow right here in my place who\xe2\x80\x99s worked there and seen every\r\nbit of it!\xe2\x80\x9d And then Jurgis would drop his work, whatever it was, and\r\ncome, and the other would say, \xe2\x80\x9cComrade Jurgis, just tell these\r\ngentlemen what you saw on the killing-beds.\xe2\x80\x9d At first this request\r\ncaused poor Jurgis the most acute agony, and it was like pulling teeth\r\nto get him to talk; but gradually he found out what was wanted, and in\r\nthe end he learned to stand up and speak his piece with enthusiasm. His\r\nemployer would sit by and encourage him with exclamations and shakes of\r\nthe head; when Jurgis would give the formula for \xe2\x80\x9cpotted ham,\xe2\x80\x9d or tell\r\nabout the condemned hogs that were dropped into the \xe2\x80\x9cdestructors\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nthe top and immediately taken out again at the bottom, to be shipped\r\ninto another state and made into lard, Tommy Hinds would bang his knee\r\nand cry, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think a man could make up a thing like that out of his\r\nhead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the hotel-keeper would go on to show how the Socialists had\r\nthe only real remedy for such evils, how they alone \xe2\x80\x9cmeant business\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith the Beef Trust. And when, in answer to this, the victim would say\r\nthat the whole country was getting stirred up, that the newspapers were\r\nfull of denunciations of it, and the government taking action against\r\nit, Tommy Hinds had a knock-out blow all ready. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call that is true\xe2\x80\x94but what do you suppose is the reason for it? Are you\r\nfoolish enough to believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s done for the public? There are\r\nother trusts in the country just as illegal and extortionate as the\r\nBeef Trust: there is the Coal Trust, that freezes the poor in\r\nwinter\xe2\x80\x94there is the Steel Trust, that doubles the price of every nail\r\nin your shoes\xe2\x80\x94there is the Oil Trust, that keeps you from reading at\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94and why do you suppose it is that all the fury of the press and\r\nthe government is directed against the Beef Trust?\xe2\x80\x9d And when to this\r\nthe victim would reply that there was clamor enough over the Oil Trust,\r\nthe other would continue: \xe2\x80\x9cTen years ago Henry D. Lloyd told all the\r\ntruth about the Standard Oil Company in his Wealth versus Commonwealth;\r\nand the book was allowed to die, and you hardly ever hear of it. And\r\nnow, at last, two magazines have the courage to tackle \xe2\x80\x98Standard Oil\xe2\x80\x99\r\nagain, and what happens? The newspapers ridicule the authors, the\r\nchurches defend the criminals, and the government\xe2\x80\x94does nothing. And\r\nnow, why is it all so different with the Beef Trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the other would generally admit that he was \xe2\x80\x9cstuck\xe2\x80\x9d; and Tommy\r\nHinds would explain to him, and it was fun to see his eyes open. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou were a Socialist,\xe2\x80\x9d the hotel-keeper would say, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would\r\nunderstand that the power which really governs the United States today\r\nis the Railroad Trust. It is the Railroad Trust that runs your state\r\ngovernment, wherever you live, and that runs the United States Senate.\r\nAnd all of the trusts that I have named are railroad trusts\xe2\x80\x94save only\r\nthe Beef Trust! The Beef Trust has defied the railroads\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nplundering them day by day through the Private Car; and so the public\r\nis roused to fury, and the papers clamor for action, and the government\r\ngoes on the war-path! And you poor common people watch and applaud the\r\njob, and think it\xe2\x80\x99s all done for you, and never dream that it is really\r\nthe grand climax of the century-long battle of commercial\r\ncompetition\xe2\x80\x94the final death grapple between the chiefs of the Beef\r\nTrust and \xe2\x80\x98Standard Oil,\xe2\x80\x99 for the prize of the mastery and ownership of\r\nthe United States of America!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the new home in which Jurgis lived and worked, and in which\r\nhis education was completed. Perhaps you would imagine that he did not\r\ndo much work there, but that would be a great mistake. He would have\r\ncut off one hand for Tommy Hinds; and to keep Hinds\xe2\x80\x99s hotel a thing of\r\nbeauty was his joy in life. That he had a score of Socialist arguments\r\nchasing through his brain in the meantime did not interfere with this;\r\non the contrary, Jurgis scrubbed the spittoons and polished the\r\nbanisters all the more vehemently because at the same time he was\r\nwrestling inwardly with an imaginary recalcitrant. It would be pleasant\r\nto record that he swore off drinking immediately, and all the rest of\r\nhis bad habits with it; but that would hardly be exact. These\r\nrevolutionists were not angels; they were men, and men who had come up\r\nfrom the social pit, and with the mire of it smeared over them. Some of\r\nthem drank, and some of them swore, and some of them ate pie with their\r\nknives; there was only one difference between them and all the rest of\r\nthe populace\xe2\x80\x94that they were men with a hope, with a cause to fight for\r\nand suffer for. There came times to Jurgis when the vision seemed\r\nfar-off and pale, and a glass of beer loomed large in comparison; but\r\nif the glass led to another glass, and to too many glasses, he had\r\nsomething to spur him to remorse and resolution on the morrow. It was\r\nso evidently a wicked thing to spend one\xe2\x80\x99s pennies for drink, when the\r\nworking class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered;\r\nthe price of a glass of beer would buy fifty copies of a leaflet, and\r\none could hand these out to the unregenerate, and then get drunk upon\r\nthe thought of the good that was being accomplished. That was the way\r\nthe movement had been made, and it was the only way it would progress;\r\nit availed nothing to know of it, without fighting for it\xe2\x80\x94it was a\r\nthing for all, not for a few! A corollary of this proposition of course\r\nwas, that any one who refused to receive the new gospel was personally\r\nresponsible for keeping Jurgis from his heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire; and this, alas,\r\nmade him uncomfortable as an acquaintance. He met some neighbors with\r\nwhom Elzbieta had made friends in her neighborhood, and he set out to\r\nmake Socialists of them by wholesale, and several times he all but got\r\ninto a fight.\r\n\r\nIt was all so painfully obvious to Jurgis! It was so incomprehensible\r\nhow a man could fail to see it! Here were all the opportunities of the\r\ncountry, the land, and the buildings upon the land, the railroads, the\r\nmines, the factories, and the stores, all in the hands of a few private\r\nindividuals, called capitalists, for whom the people were obliged to\r\nwork for wages. The whole balance of what the people produced went to\r\nheap up the fortunes of these capitalists, to heap, and heap again, and\r\nyet again\xe2\x80\x94and that in spite of the fact that they, and every one about\r\nthem, lived in unthinkable luxury! And was it not plain that if the\r\npeople cut off the share of those who merely \xe2\x80\x9cowned,\xe2\x80\x9d the share of\r\nthose who worked would be much greater? That was as plain as two and\r\ntwo makes four; and it was the whole of it, absolutely the whole of it;\r\nand yet there were people who could not see it, who would argue about\r\neverything else in the world. They would tell you that governments\r\ncould not manage things as economically as private individuals; they\r\nwould repeat and repeat that, and think they were saying something!\r\nThey could not see that \xe2\x80\x9ceconomical\xe2\x80\x9d management by masters meant simply\r\nthat they, the people, were worked harder and ground closer and paid\r\nless! They were wage-earners and servants, at the mercy of exploiters\r\nwhose one thought was to get as much out of them as possible; and they\r\nwere taking an interest in the process, were anxious lest it should not\r\nbe done thoroughly enough! Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an\r\nargument such as that?\r\n\r\nAnd yet there were things even worse. You would begin talking to some\r\npoor devil who had worked in one shop for the last thirty years, and\r\nhad never been able to save a penny; who left home every morning at six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, to go and tend a machine, and come back at night too tired to\r\ntake his clothes off; who had never had a week\xe2\x80\x99s vacation in his life,\r\nhad never traveled, never had an adventure, never learned anything,\r\nnever hoped anything\xe2\x80\x94and when you started to tell him about Socialism\r\nhe would sniff and say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in that\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m an\r\nindividualist!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he would go on to tell you that Socialism was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpaternalism,\xe2\x80\x9d and that if it ever had its way the world would stop\r\nprogressing. It was enough to make a mule laugh, to hear arguments like\r\nthat; and yet it was no laughing matter, as you found out\xe2\x80\x94for how many\r\nmillions of such poor deluded wretches there were, whose lives had been\r\nso stunted by capitalism that they no longer knew what freedom was! And\r\nthey really thought that it was \xe2\x80\x9cindividualism\xe2\x80\x9d for tens of thousands\r\nof them to herd together and obey the orders of a steel magnate, and\r\nproduce hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for him, and then let\r\nhim give them libraries; while for them to take the industry, and run\r\nit to suit themselves, and build their own libraries\xe2\x80\x94that would have\r\nbeen \xe2\x80\x9cPaternalism\xe2\x80\x9d!\r\n\r\nSometimes the agony of such things as this was almost more than Jurgis\r\ncould bear; yet there was no way of escape from it, there was nothing\r\nto do but to dig away at the base of this mountain of ignorance and\r\nprejudice. You must keep at the poor fellow; you must hold your temper,\r\nand argue with him, and watch for your chance to stick an idea or two\r\ninto his head. And the rest of the time you must sharpen up your\r\nweapons\xe2\x80\x94you must think out new replies to his objections, and provide\r\nyourself with new facts to prove to him the folly of his ways.\r\n\r\nSo Jurgis acquired the reading habit. He would carry in his pocket a\r\ntract or a pamphlet which some one had loaned him, and whenever he had\r\nan idle moment during the day he would plod through a paragraph, and\r\nthen think about it while he worked. Also he read the newspapers, and\r\nasked questions about them. One of the other porters at Hinds\xe2\x80\x99s was a\r\nsharp little Irishman, who knew everything that Jurgis wanted to know;\r\nand while they were busy he would explain to him the geography of\r\nAmerica, and its history, its constitution and its laws; also he gave\r\nhim an idea of the business system of the country, the great railroads\r\nand corporations, and who owned them, and the labor unions, and the big\r\nstrikes, and the men who had led them. Then at night, when he could get\r\noff, Jurgis would attend the Socialist meetings. During the campaign\r\none was not dependent upon the street corner affairs, where the weather\r\nand the quality of the orator were equally uncertain; there were hall\r\nmeetings every night, and one could hear speakers of national\r\nprominence. These discussed the political situation from every point of\r\nview, and all that troubled Jurgis was the impossibility of carrying\r\noff but a small part of the treasures they offered him.\r\n\r\nThere was a man who was known in the party as the \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Giant.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nLord had used up so much material in the making of his head that there\r\nhad not been enough to complete his legs; but he got about on the\r\nplatform, and when he shook his raven whiskers the pillars of\r\ncapitalism rocked. He had written a veritable encyclopedia upon the\r\nsubject, a book that was nearly as big as himself\xe2\x80\x94And then there was a\r\nyoung author, who came from California, and had been a salmon fisher,\r\nan oyster-pirate, a longshoreman, a sailor; who had tramped the country\r\nand been sent to jail, had lived in the Whitechapel slums, and been to\r\nthe Klondike in search of gold. All these things he pictured in his\r\nbooks, and because he was a man of genius he forced the world to hear\r\nhim. Now he was famous, but wherever he went he still preached the\r\ngospel of the poor. And then there was one who was known at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmillionaire Socialist.\xe2\x80\x9d He had made a fortune in business, and spent\r\nnearly all of it in building up a magazine, which the post office\r\ndepartment had tried to suppress, and had driven to Canada. He was a\r\nquiet-mannered man, whom you would have taken for anything in the world\r\nbut a Socialist agitator. His speech was simple and informal\xe2\x80\x94he could\r\nnot understand why any one should get excited about these things. It\r\nwas a process of economic evolution, he said, and he exhibited its laws\r\nand methods. Life was a struggle for existence, and the strong overcame\r\nthe weak, and in turn were overcome by the strongest. Those who lost in\r\nthe struggle were generally exterminated; but now and then they had\r\nbeen known to save themselves by combination\xe2\x80\x94which was a new and higher\r\nkind of strength. It was so that the gregarious animals had overcome\r\nthe predaceous; it was so, in human history, that the people had\r\nmastered the kings. The workers were simply the citizens of industry,\r\nand the Socialist movement was the expression of their will to survive.\r\nThe inevitability of the revolution depended upon this fact, that they\r\nhad no choice but to unite or be exterminated; this fact, grim and\r\ninexorable, depended upon no human will, it was the law of the economic\r\nprocess, of which the editor showed the details with the most marvelous\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nAnd later on came the evening of the great meeting of the campaign,\r\nwhen Jurgis heard the two standard-bearers of his party. Ten years\r\nbefore there had been in Chicago a strike of a hundred and fifty\r\nthousand railroad employees, and thugs had been hired by the railroads\r\nto commit violence, and the President of the United States had sent in\r\ntroops to break the strike, by flinging the officers of the union into\r\njail without trial. The president of the union came out of his cell a\r\nruined man; but also he came out a Socialist; and now for just ten\r\nyears he had been traveling up and down the country, standing face to\r\nface with the people, and pleading with them for justice. He was a man\r\nof electric presence, tall and gaunt, with a face worn thin by struggle\r\nand suffering. The fury of outraged manhood gleamed in it\xe2\x80\x94and the tears\r\nof suffering little children pleaded in his voice. When he spoke he\r\npaced the stage, lithe and eager, like a panther. He leaned over,\r\nreaching out for his audience; he pointed into their souls with an\r\ninsistent finger. His voice was husky from much speaking, but the great\r\nauditorium was as still as death, and every one heard him.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as Jurgis came out from this meeting, some one handed him a\r\npaper which he carried home with him and read; and so he became\r\nacquainted with the \xe2\x80\x9cAppeal to Reason.\xe2\x80\x9d About twelve years previously a\r\nColorado real-estate speculator had made up his mind that it was wrong\r\nto gamble in the necessities of life of human beings: and so he had\r\nretired and begun the publication of a Socialist weekly. There had come\r\na time when he had to set his own type, but he had held on and won out,\r\nand now his publication was an institution. It used a carload of paper\r\nevery week, and the mail trains would be hours loading up at the depot\r\nof the little Kansas town. It was a four-page weekly, which sold for\r\nless than half a cent a copy; its regular subscription list was a\r\nquarter of a million, and it went to every crossroads post office in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cAppeal\xe2\x80\x9d was a \xe2\x80\x9cpropaganda\xe2\x80\x9d paper. It had a manner all its own\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas full of ginger and spice, of Western slang and hustle: It collected\r\nnews of the doings of the \xe2\x80\x9cplutes,\xe2\x80\x9d and served it up for the benefit of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican working-mule.\xe2\x80\x9d It would have columns of the deadly\r\nparallel\xe2\x80\x94the million dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of diamonds, or the fancy\r\npet-poodle establishment of a society dame, beside the fate of Mrs.\r\nMurphy of San Francisco, who had starved to death on the streets, or of\r\nJohn Robinson, just out of the hospital, who had hanged himself in New\r\nYork because he could not find work. It collected the stories of graft\r\nand misery from the daily press, and made a little pungent paragraphs\r\nout of them. \xe2\x80\x9cThree banks of Bungtown, South Dakota, failed, and more\r\nsavings of the workers swallowed up!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe mayor of Sandy Creek,\r\nOklahoma, has skipped with a hundred thousand dollars. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind\r\nof rulers the old partyites give you!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe president of the Florida\r\nFlying Machine Company is in jail for bigamy. He was a prominent\r\nopponent of Socialism, which he said would break up the home!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAppeal\xe2\x80\x9d had what it called its \xe2\x80\x9cArmy,\xe2\x80\x9d about thirty thousand of the\r\nfaithful, who did things for it; and it was always exhorting the \xe2\x80\x9cArmy\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto keep its dander up, and occasionally encouraging it with a prize\r\ncompetition, for anything from a gold watch to a private yacht or an\r\neighty-acre farm. Its office helpers were all known to the \xe2\x80\x9cArmy\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\nquaint titles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cInky Ike,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bald-headed Man,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe Redheaded Girl,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Bulldog,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe Office Goat,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe One Hoss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, again, the \xe2\x80\x9cAppeal\xe2\x80\x9d would be desperately serious. It\r\nsent a correspondent to Colorado, and printed pages describing the\r\noverthrow of American institutions in that state. In a certain city of\r\nthe country it had over forty of its \xe2\x80\x9cArmy\xe2\x80\x9d in the headquarters of the\r\nTelegraph Trust, and no message of importance to Socialists ever went\r\nthrough that a copy of it did not go to the \xe2\x80\x9cAppeal.\xe2\x80\x9d It would print\r\ngreat broadsides during the campaign; one copy that came to Jurgis was\r\na manifesto addressed to striking workingmen, of which nearly a million\r\ncopies had been distributed in the industrial centers, wherever the\r\nemployers\xe2\x80\x99 associations had been carrying out their \xe2\x80\x9copen shop\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nprogram. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have lost the strike!\xe2\x80\x9d it was headed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now what are\r\nyou going to do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d It was what is called an \xe2\x80\x9cincendiary\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nappeal\xe2\x80\x94it was written by a man into whose soul the iron had entered.\r\nWhen this edition appeared, twenty thousand copies were sent to the\r\nstockyards district; and they were taken out and stowed away in the\r\nrear of a little cigar store, and every evening, and on Sundays, the\r\nmembers of the Packingtown locals would get armfuls and distribute them\r\non the streets and in the houses. The people of Packingtown had lost\r\ntheir strike, if ever a people had, and so they read these papers\r\ngladly, and twenty thousand were hardly enough to go round. Jurgis had\r\nresolved not to go near his old home again, but when he heard of this\r\nit was too much for him, and every night for a week he would get on the\r\ncar and ride out to the stockyards, and help to undo his work of the\r\nprevious year, when he had sent Mike Scully\xe2\x80\x99s ten-pin setter to the\r\ncity Board of Aldermen.\r\n\r\nIt was quite marvelous to see what a difference twelve months had made\r\nin Packingtown\xe2\x80\x94the eyes of the people were getting opened! The\r\nSocialists were literally sweeping everything before them that\r\nelection, and Scully and the Cook County machine were at their wits\xe2\x80\x99\r\nend for an \xe2\x80\x9cissue.\xe2\x80\x9d At the very close of the campaign they bethought\r\nthemselves of the fact that the strike had been broken by Negroes, and\r\nso they sent for a South Carolina fire-eater, the \xe2\x80\x9cpitchfork senator,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas he was called, a man who took off his coat when he talked to\r\nworkingmen, and damned and swore like a Hessian. This meeting they\r\nadvertised extensively, and the Socialists advertised it too\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\nresult that about a thousand of them were on hand that evening. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpitchfork senator\xe2\x80\x9d stood their fusillade of questions for about an\r\nhour, and then went home in disgust, and the balance of the meeting was\r\na strictly party affair. Jurgis, who had insisted upon coming, had the\r\ntime of his life that night; he danced about and waved his arms in his\r\nexcitement\xe2\x80\x94and at the very climax he broke loose from his friends, and\r\ngot out into the aisle, and proceeded to make a speech himself! The\r\nsenator had been denying that the Democratic party was corrupt; it was\r\nalways the Republicans who bought the votes, he said\xe2\x80\x94and here was\r\nJurgis shouting furiously, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lie! It\xe2\x80\x99s a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d After which he\r\nwent on to tell them how he knew it\xe2\x80\x94that he knew it because he had\r\nbought them himself! And he would have told the \xe2\x80\x9cpitchfork senator\xe2\x80\x9d all\r\nhis experiences, had not Harry Adams and a friend grabbed him about the\r\nneck and shoved him into a seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to\r\ngo and see Marija. She came down into the basement of the house to meet\r\nhim, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot work now, and so you can leave here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Marija only shook her head. There was nothing else for her to do,\r\nshe said, and nobody to employ her. She could not keep her past a\r\nsecret\xe2\x80\x94girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were\r\nthousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would\r\nmeet one of them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides,\xe2\x80\x9d Marija added, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m no good\xe2\x80\x94I take dope. What could you do with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you stop?\xe2\x80\x9d Jurgis cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never stop. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here till I die, I guess. It\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99m fit for.\xe2\x80\x9d And that\r\nwas all that he could get her to say\xe2\x80\x94there was no use trying. When he\r\ntold her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered\r\nindifferently: \xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99ll be wasted here\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyelids\r\nlooked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was\r\nannoying her, that she only wanted him to go away. So he went,\r\ndisappointed and sad.\r\n\r\nPoor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life. Elzbieta was sick a\r\ngood deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the\r\nworse for their life upon the streets. But he stuck by the family\r\nnevertheless, for they reminded him of his old happiness; and when\r\nthings went wrong he could solace himself with a plunge into the\r\nSocialist movement. Since his life had been caught up into the current\r\nof this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life to\r\nhim came to seem of relatively slight importance; his interests were\r\nelsewhere, in the world of ideas. His outward life was commonplace and\r\nuninteresting; he was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one\r\nwhile he lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his life was a\r\nperpetual adventure. There was so much to know\xe2\x80\x94so many wonders to be\r\ndiscovered! Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before\r\nelection, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry\r\nAdams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis\r\nwent, and met one of the minds of the movement.\r\n\r\nThe invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who\r\nhad given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the\r\nheart of the city\xe2\x80\x99s slums. He did not belong to the party, but he was\r\nin sympathy with it; and he said that he was to have as his guest that\r\nnight the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against\r\nSocialism, but really did not know what it was. The millionaire\r\nsuggested that Adams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cpure food,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the editor was interested.\r\n\r\nYoung Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and\r\nweather-beaten outside, but attractive within. The room that Jurgis saw\r\nwas half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly\r\nvisible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a log\r\nfire was crackling in the open hearth. Seven or eight people were\r\ngathered about it when Adams and his friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to\r\nhis dismay that three of them were ladies. He had never talked to\r\npeople of this sort before, and he fell into an agony of embarrassment.\r\nHe stood in the doorway clutching his hat tightly in his hands, and\r\nmade a deep bow to each of the persons as he was introduced; then, when\r\nhe was asked to have a seat, he took a chair in a dark corner, and sat\r\ndown upon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his forehead\r\nwith his sleeve. He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk.\r\n\r\nThere was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening\r\ndress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named\r\nMaynard. There was the former\xe2\x80\x99s frail young wife, and also an elderly\r\nlady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college\r\nstudent, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face. She only\r\nspoke once or twice while Jurgis was there\xe2\x80\x94the rest of the time she sat\r\nby the table in the center of the room, resting her chin in her hands\r\nand drinking in the conversation. There were two other men, whom young\r\nFisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Schliemann; he\r\nheard them address Adams as \xe2\x80\x9cComrade,\xe2\x80\x9d and so he knew that they were\r\nSocialists.\r\n\r\nThe one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of\r\nclerical aspect; he had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired,\r\nand had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation. He\r\ntraveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon\r\nhospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall.\r\nThe other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor\r\nwhen Adams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they\r\nresumed it after the interruption. Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound,\r\nthinking that here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nNicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands\r\nand bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a\r\nprofessor of philosophy\xe2\x80\x94until, as he said, he had found that he was\r\nselling his character as well as his time. Instead he had come to\r\nAmerica, where he lived in a garret room in this slum district, and\r\nmade volcanic energy take the place of fire. He studied the composition\r\nof food-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates\r\nhis body needed; and by scientific chewing he said that he tripled the\r\nvalue of all he ate, so that it cost him eleven cents a day. About the\r\nfirst of July he would leave Chicago for his vacation, on foot; and\r\nwhen he struck the harvest fields he would set to work for two dollars\r\nand a half a day, and come home when he had another year\xe2\x80\x99s supply\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhundred and twenty-five dollars. That was the nearest approach to\r\nindependence a man could make \xe2\x80\x9cunder capitalism,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained; he\r\nwould never marry, for no sane man would allow himself to fall in love\r\nuntil after the revolution.\r\n\r\nHe sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far\r\nin the shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the\r\nfire on the hearth. He spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with\r\nthe manner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom\r\nin geometry, he would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of\r\nan ordinary person rise on end. And when the auditor had asserted his\r\nnon-comprehension, he would proceed to elucidate by some new\r\nproposition, yet more appalling. To Jurgis the Herr Dr. Schliemann\r\nassumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake. And yet,\r\nstrange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he\r\ncould follow the argument nearly all the time. He was carried over the\r\ndifficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad\r\ncareer\xe2\x80\x94a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation.\r\n\r\nNicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man as\r\na small part of it. He understood human institutions, and blew them\r\nabout like soap bubbles. It was surprising that so much destructiveness\r\ncould be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose of\r\ngovernment was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation of\r\nancient force and modern fraud. Or was it marriage? Marriage and\r\nprostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a\r\ndifference of class. If a woman had money she might dictate her own\r\nterms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy\xe2\x80\x94that is, the\r\nproperty-rights\xe2\x80\x94of her children. If she had no money, she was a\r\nproletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject\r\nbecame Religion, which was the Archfiend\xe2\x80\x99s deadliest weapon. Government\r\noppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind,\r\nand poisoned the stream of progress at its source. The working-man was\r\nto fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in\r\nthis one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience\xe2\x80\x94in short\r\nto all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism. The destiny of civilization\r\nwould be decided in one final death struggle between the Red\r\nInternational and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch; while here at home, \xe2\x80\x9cthe stygian midnight of American\r\nevangelicalism\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively\r\ntussle. \xe2\x80\x9cComrade\xe2\x80\x9d Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he knew\r\nonly the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience.\r\nAnd what was the use, he asked, of confusing Religion with men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperversions of it? That the church was in the hands of the merchants at\r\nthe moment was obvious enough; but already there were signs of\r\nrebellion, and if Comrade Schliemann could come back a few years from\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cof course, I have no doubt that in a\r\nhundred years the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed\r\nSocialism, just as at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not defending the Vatican,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lucas, vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ndefending the word of God\xe2\x80\x94which is one long cry of the human spirit for\r\ndeliverance from the sway of oppression. Take the twenty-fourth chapter\r\nof the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the Bible upon the Beef Trust\xe2\x80\x99; or take the words of Isaiah\xe2\x80\x94or of the\r\nMaster himself! Not the elegant prince of our debauched and vicious\r\nart, not the jeweled idol of our society churches\xe2\x80\x94but the Jesus of the\r\nawful reality, the man of sorrow and pain, the outcast, despised of the\r\nworld, who had nowhere to lay his head\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will grant you Jesus,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucas, \xe2\x80\x9cand why should Jesus have nothing to do\r\nwith his church\xe2\x80\x94why should his words and his life be of no authority\r\namong those who profess to adore him? Here is a man who was the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst revolutionist, the true founder of the Socialist movement; a man\r\nwhose whole being was one flame of hatred for wealth, and all that\r\nwealth stands for,\xe2\x80\x94for the pride of wealth, and the luxury of wealth,\r\nand the tyranny of wealth; who was himself a beggar and a tramp, a man\r\nof the people, an associate of saloon-keepers and women of the town;\r\nwho again and again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth\r\nand the holding of wealth: \xe2\x80\x98Lay not up for yourselves treasures on\r\nearth!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Sell that ye have and give alms!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Blessed are ye poor, for\r\nyours is the kingdom of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Woe unto you that are rich, for ye\r\nhave received your consolation!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Verily, I say unto you, that a rich\r\nman shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 Who denounced in\r\nunmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time: \xe2\x80\x98Woe unto you, scribes\r\nand pharisees, hypocrites!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Woe unto you also, you lawyers!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Ye\r\nserpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of\r\nhell?\xe2\x80\x99 Who drove out the business men and brokers from the temple with\r\na whip! Who was crucified\xe2\x80\x94think of it\xe2\x80\x94for an incendiary and a disturber\r\nof the social order! And this man they have made into the high priest\r\nof property and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the\r\nhorrors and abominations of modern commercial civilization! Jeweled\r\nimages are made of him, sensual priests burn incense to him, and modern\r\npirates of industry bring their dollars, wrung from the toil of\r\nhelpless women and children, and build temples to him, and sit in\r\ncushioned seats and listen to his teachings expounded by doctors of\r\ndusty divinity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Schliemann, laughing. But the other was in full\r\ncareer\xe2\x80\x94he had talked this subject every day for five years, and had\r\nnever yet let himself be stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cThis Jesus of Nazareth!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis class-conscious working-man! This union carpenter! This agitator,\r\nlaw-breaker, firebrand, anarchist! He, the sovereign lord and master of\r\na world which grinds the bodies and souls of human beings into\r\ndollars\xe2\x80\x94if he could come into the world this day and see the things\r\nthat men have made in his name, would it not blast his soul with\r\nhorror? Would he not go mad at the sight of it, he the Prince of Mercy\r\nand Love! That dreadful night when he lay in the Garden of Gethsemane\r\nand writhed in agony until he sweat blood\xe2\x80\x94do you think that he saw\r\nanything worse than he might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria,\r\nwhere men march out with a jeweled image of him before them, to do\r\nwholesale murder for the benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and\r\ncruelty? Do you not know that if he were in St. Petersburg now, he\r\nwould take the whip with which he drove out the bankers from his\r\ntemple\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the speaker paused an instant for breath. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nother, dryly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he was a practical man. He would take pretty little\r\nimitation lemons, such as are now being shipped into Russia, handy for\r\ncarrying in the pockets, and strong enough to blow a whole temple out\r\nof sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucas waited until the company had stopped laughing over this; then he\r\nbegan again: \xe2\x80\x9cBut look at it from the point of view of practical\r\npolitics, comrade. Here is an historical figure whom all men reverence\r\nand love, whom some regard as divine; and who was one of us\xe2\x80\x94who lived\r\nour life, and taught our doctrine. And now shall we leave him in the\r\nhands of his enemies\xe2\x80\x94shall we allow them to stifle and stultify his\r\nexample? We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not\r\nquote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he\r\ntaught, and what he did? No, no, a thousand times no!\xe2\x80\x94we shall use his\r\nauthority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his ministry, and\r\nwe shall yet rouse the people to action!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on\r\nthe table. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a place for\r\nyou to begin. A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty\r\nthousand dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of diamonds! And a most unctuous and oily of\r\nbishops! An eminent and scholarly bishop! A philanthropist and friend\r\nof labor bishop\xe2\x80\x94a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of\r\nthe wage-working-man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as\r\nspectators. But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark,\r\nsomewhat na\xc3\xafvely, that he had always understood that Socialists had a\r\ncut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were\r\ntwo active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were\r\nagreed about nothing at all. Would the two, for his enlightenment, try\r\nto ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the\r\nsame party? This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of\r\ntwo carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in\r\nthe common ownership and democratic management of the means of\r\nproducing the necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist\r\nbelieves that the means by which this is to be brought about is the\r\nclass conscious political organization of the wage-earners. Thus far\r\nthey were at one; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the\r\nco-operative commonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven,\r\nwhich is \xe2\x80\x9cwithin you.\xe2\x80\x9d To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary\r\nstep toward a far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience.\r\nSchliemann called himself a \xe2\x80\x9cphilosophic anarchist\xe2\x80\x9d; and he explained\r\nthat an anarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence\r\nwas the free development of every personality, unrestricted by laws\r\nsave those of its own being. Since the same kind of match would light\r\nevery one\xe2\x80\x99s fire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s stomach, it would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the\r\ncontrol of a majority vote. There was only one earth, and the quantity\r\nof material things was limited. Of intellectual and moral things, on\r\nthe other hand, there was no limit, and one could have more without\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s having less; hence \xe2\x80\x9cCommunism in material production,\r\nanarchism in intellectual,\xe2\x80\x9d was the formula of modern proletarian\r\nthought. As soon as the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society\r\nhad been healed, there would be established a simple system whereby\r\neach man was credited with his labor and debited with his purchases;\r\nand after that the processes of production, exchange, and consumption\r\nwould go on automatically, and without our being conscious of them, any\r\nmore than a man is conscious of the beating of his heart. And then,\r\nexplained Schliemann, society would break up into independent,\r\nself-governing communities of mutually congenial persons; examples of\r\nwhich at present were clubs, churches, and political parties. After the\r\nrevolution, all the intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of\r\nmen would be cared for by such \xe2\x80\x9cfree associations\xe2\x80\x9d; romantic novelists\r\nwould be supported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and\r\nimpressionist painters would be supported by those who liked to look at\r\nimpressionist pictures\xe2\x80\x94and the same with preachers and scientists,\r\neditors and actors and musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or\r\npray, and could find no one to maintain him, he could support himself\r\nby working part of the time. That was the case at present, the only\r\ndifference being that the competitive wage system compelled a man to\r\nwork all the time to live, while, after the abolition of privilege and\r\nexploitation, any one would be able to support himself by an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork a day. Also the artist\xe2\x80\x99s audience of the present was a small\r\nminority of people, all debased and vulgarized by the effort it had\r\ncost them to win in the commercial battle, of the intellectual and\r\nartistic activities which would result when the whole of mankind was\r\nset free from the nightmare of competition, we could at present form no\r\nconception whatever.\r\n\r\nAnd then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann\r\nasserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s toil by each of its members. \xe2\x80\x9cJust what,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould be the productive capacity of society if the present resources\r\nof science were utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may\r\nbe sure it would exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds\r\ninured to the ferocious barbarities of capitalism. After the triumph of\r\nthe international proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable;\r\nand who can figure the cost of war to humanity\xe2\x80\x94not merely the value of\r\nthe lives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of\r\nkeeping millions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for\r\nbattle and parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by\r\nthe war attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the\r\ndrunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial\r\nimpotence and the moral deadness? Do you think that it would be too\r\nmuch to say that two hours of the working time of every efficient\r\nmember of a community goes to feed the red fiend of war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of\r\ncompetition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and\r\nfriction; the vices\xe2\x80\x94such as drink, for instance, the use of which had\r\nnearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification\r\nof the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the\r\ncommunity, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the\r\nwhole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the\r\nmilliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and\r\nlackeys. \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in a society dominated by the\r\nfact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of\r\nprowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power. So we have, at\r\nthe present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the\r\npopulation occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent\r\noccupied in destroying them. And this is not all; for the servants and\r\npanders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the\r\njewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful\r\nmembers of the community. And bear in mind also that this monstrous\r\ndisease affects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison\r\npenetrates the whole social body. Beneath the hundred thousand women of\r\nthe elite are a million middle-class women, miserable because they are\r\nnot of the elite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath\r\nthem, in turn, are five million farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives reading \xe2\x80\x98fashion papers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand trimming bonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling\r\nthemselves into brothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin\r\nrobes. And then consider that, added to this competition in display,\r\nyou have, like oil on the flames, a whole system of competition in\r\nselling! You have manufacturers contriving tens of thousands of\r\ncatchpenny devices, storekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and\r\nmagazines filled up with advertisements of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the wastes of fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d put in young Fisher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresponded Schliemann\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe science of persuading people to buy what they\r\ndo not want\xe2\x80\x94he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house of\r\ncapitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen\r\nhorrors to point out first. But consider the waste in time and energy\r\nincidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes of\r\nostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use!\r\nConsider all the waste incidental to the manufacture of cheap qualities\r\nof goods, of goods made to sell and deceive the ignorant; consider the\r\nwastes of adulteration,\xe2\x80\x94the shoddy clothing, the cotton blankets, the\r\nunstable tenements, the ground-cork life-preservers, the adulterated\r\nmilk, the aniline soda water, the potato-flour sausages\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd consider the moral aspects of the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the ex-preacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schliemann; \xe2\x80\x9cthe low knavery and the ferocious\r\ncruelty incidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing,\r\nthe blustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and\r\nworrying. Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of\r\ncompetition\xe2\x80\x94they are but another form of the phrase \xe2\x80\x98to buy in the\r\ncheapest market and sell in the dearest.\xe2\x80\x99 A government official has\r\nstated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter\r\ndollars a year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not\r\nonly materials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human\r\nstomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have\r\nbeen well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years\r\nbefore the proper time. Then again, consider the waste of time and\r\nenergy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would\r\ndo. There are a million or two of business firms in the country, and\r\nfive or ten times as many clerks; and consider the handling and\r\nrehandling, the accounting and reaccounting, the planning and worrying,\r\nthe balancing of petty profit and loss. Consider the whole machinery of\r\nthe civil law made necessary by these processes; the libraries of\r\nponderous tomes, the courts and juries to interpret them, the lawyers\r\nstudying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the\r\nhatreds and lies! Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and\r\nhaphazard production of commodities\xe2\x80\x94the factories closed, the workers\r\nidle, the goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the\r\nstock manipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the\r\noverstimulation of others, for speculative purposes; the assignments\r\nand bank failures, the crises and panics, the deserted towns and the\r\nstarving populations! Consider the energies wasted in the seeking of\r\nmarkets, the sterile trades, such as drummer, solicitor, bill-poster,\r\nadvertising agent. Consider the wastes incidental to the crowding into\r\ncities, made necessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates;\r\nconsider the slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital\r\nenergies; consider the office buildings, the waste of time and material\r\nin the piling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground! Then\r\ntake the whole business of insurance, the enormous mass of\r\nadministrative and clerical labor it involves, and all utter waste\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not follow that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the editor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cooperative Commonwealth\r\nis a universal automatic insurance company and savings bank for all its\r\nmembers. Capital being the property of all, injury to it is shared by\r\nall and made up by all. The bank is the universal government\r\ncredit-account, the ledger in which every individual\xe2\x80\x99s earnings and\r\nspendings are balanced. There is also a universal government bulletin,\r\nin which are listed and precisely described everything which the\r\ncommonwealth has for sale. As no one makes any profit by the sale,\r\nthere is no longer any stimulus to extravagance, and no\r\nmisrepresentation; no cheating, no adulteration or imitation, no\r\nbribery or \xe2\x80\x98grafting.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the price of an article determined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is\r\ndetermined by the first principles of arithmetic. The million workers\r\nin the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the\r\ntotal product of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a\r\nbushel of wheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day. If we employ an\r\narbitrary symbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then\r\nthe cost of a bushel of wheat is fifty cents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say \xe2\x80\x98for farm work,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Maynard. \xe2\x80\x9cThen labor is not to be\r\npaid alike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should\r\nhave millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners. Of course the\r\nwages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will\r\nhave to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of\r\nworkers is needed in any particular industry. That is precisely what is\r\ndone at present, except that the transfer of the workers is\r\naccomplished blindly and imperfectly, by rumors and advertisements,\r\ninstead of instantly and completely, by a universal government\r\nbulletin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?\r\nWhat is the labor cost of a book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObviously it is the labor cost of the paper, printing, and binding of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94about a fifth of its present cost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the author?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already said that the state could not control intellectual\r\nproduction. The state might say that it had taken a year to write the\r\nbook, and the author might say it had taken thirty. Goethe said that\r\nevery _bon mot_ of his had cost a purse of gold. What I outline here is\r\na national, or rather international, system for the providing of the\r\nmaterial needs of men. Since a man has intellectual needs also, he will\r\nwork longer, earn more, and provide for them to his own taste and in\r\nhis own way. I live on the same earth as the majority, I wear the same\r\nkind of shoes and sleep in the same kind of bed; but I do not think the\r\nsame kind of thoughts, and I do not wish to pay for such thinkers as\r\nthe majority selects. I wish such things to be left to free effort, as\r\nat present. If people want to listen to a certain preacher, they get\r\ntogether and contribute what they please, and pay for a church and\r\nsupport the preacher, and then listen to him; I, who do not want to\r\nlisten to him, stay away, and it costs me nothing. In the same way\r\nthere are magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and\r\nflying machines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of\r\nthem. On the other hand, if wage slavery were abolished, and I could\r\nearn some spare money without paying tribute to an exploiting\r\ncapitalist, then there would be a magazine for the purpose of\r\ninterpreting and popularizing the gospel of Friedrich Nietzsche, the\r\nprophet of Evolution, and also of Horace Fletcher, the inventor of the\r\nnoble science of clean eating; and incidentally, perhaps, for the\r\ndiscouraging of long skirts, and the scientific breeding of men and\r\nwomen, and the establishing of divorce by mutual consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Schliemann paused for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a lecture,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with\r\na laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet I am only begun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else is there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Maynard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI have hardly mentioned the positive economies of\r\nco-operation. Allowing five to a family, there are fifteen million\r\nfamilies in this country; and at least ten million of these live\r\nseparately, the domestic drudge being either the wife or a wage slave.\r\nNow set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the\r\neconomies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the\r\nwashing of dishes. Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing\r\nfor a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied\r\npersons\xe2\x80\x94mostly women to do the dish-washing of the country. And note\r\nthat this is most filthy and deadening and brutalizing work; that it is\r\na cause of anemia, nervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of\r\nprostitution, suicide, and insanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94for all of which things the community has naturally to pay.\r\nAnd now consider that in each of my little free communities there would\r\nbe a machine which would wash and dry the dishes, and do it, not merely\r\nto the eye and the touch, but scientifically\xe2\x80\x94sterilizing them\xe2\x80\x94and do it\r\nat a saving of all the drudgery and nine-tenths of the time! All of\r\nthese things you may find in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take\r\nKropotkin\xe2\x80\x99s Fields, Factories, and Workshops, and read about the new\r\nscience of agriculture, which has been built up in the last ten years;\r\nby which, with made soils and intensive culture, a gardener can raise\r\nten or twelve crops in a season, and two hundred tons of vegetables\r\nupon a single acre; by which the population of the whole globe could be\r\nsupported on the soil now cultivated in the United States alone! It is\r\nimpossible to apply such methods now, owing to the ignorance and\r\npoverty of our scattered farming population; but imagine the problem of\r\nproviding the food supply of our nation once taken in hand\r\nsystematically and rationally, by scientists! All the poor and rocky\r\nland set apart for a national timber reserve, in which our children\r\nplay, and our young men hunt, and our poets dwell! The most favorable\r\nclimate and soil for each product selected; the exact requirements of\r\nthe community known, and the acreage figured accordingly; the most\r\nimproved machinery employed, under the direction of expert agricultural\r\nchemists! I was brought up on a farm, and I know the awful deadliness\r\nof farm work; and I like to picture it all as it will be after the\r\nrevolution. To picture the great potato-planting machine, drawn by four\r\nhorses, or an electric motor, ploughing the furrow, cutting and\r\ndropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a score of acres a\r\nday! To picture the great potato-digging machine, run by electricity,\r\nperhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field, scooping up earth and\r\npotatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks! To every other kind of\r\nvegetable and fruit handled in the same way\xe2\x80\x94apples and oranges picked\r\nby machinery, cows milked by electricity\xe2\x80\x94things which are already done,\r\nas you may know. To picture the harvest fields of the future, to which\r\nmillions of happy men and women come for a summer holiday, brought by\r\nspecial trains, the exactly needful number to each place! And to\r\ncontrast all this with our present agonizing system of independent\r\nsmall farming,\xe2\x80\x94a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated with a yellow,\r\nlean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning\r\nuntil nine at night, working the children as soon as they are able to\r\nwalk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut out from\r\nall knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and\r\ninvention, and all the joys of the spirit\xe2\x80\x94held to a bare existence by\r\ncompetition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too\r\nblind to see his chains!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Schliemann paused a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cplace beside\r\nthis fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of\r\nphysiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to\r\noverfeeding! And then again, it has been proven that meat is\r\nunnecessary as a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce\r\nthan vegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more\r\nlikely to be unclean. But what of that, so long as it tickles the\r\npalate more strongly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would Socialism change that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl-student, quickly. It\r\nwas the first time she had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as we have wage slavery,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Schliemann, \xe2\x80\x9cit matters not\r\nin the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to\r\nfind people to perform it. But just as soon as labor is set free, then\r\nthe price of such work will begin to rise. So one by one the old,\r\ndingy, and unsanitary factories will come down\xe2\x80\x94it will be cheaper to\r\nbuild new; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking\r\nmachinery, and so the dangerous trades will be made safe, or\r\nsubstitutes will be found for their products. In exactly the same way,\r\nas the citizens of our Industrial Republic become refined, year by year\r\nthe cost of slaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually\r\nthose who want to eat meat will have to do their own killing\xe2\x80\x94and how\r\nlong do you think the custom would survive then?\xe2\x80\x94To go on to another\r\nitem\xe2\x80\x94one of the necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy\r\nis political corruption; and one of the consequences of civic\r\nadministration by ignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable\r\ndiseases kill off half our population. And even if science were allowed\r\nto try, it could do little, because the majority of human beings are\r\nnot yet human beings at all, but simply machines for the creating of\r\nwealth for others. They are penned up in filthy houses and left to rot\r\nand stew in misery, and the conditions of their life make them ill\r\nfaster than all the doctors in the world could heal them; and so, of\r\ncourse, they remain as centers of contagion, poisoning the lives of all\r\nof us, and making happiness impossible for even the most selfish. For\r\nthis reason I would seriously maintain that all the medical and\r\nsurgical discoveries that science can make in the future will be of\r\nless importance than the application of the knowledge we already\r\npossess, when the disinherited of the earth have established their\r\nright to a human existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again. Jurgis had\r\nnoticed that the beautiful young girl who sat by the center-table was\r\nlistening with something of the same look that he himself had worn, the\r\ntime when he had first discovered Socialism. Jurgis would have liked to\r\ntalk to her, he felt sure that she would have understood him. Later on\r\nin the evening, when the group broke up, he heard Mrs. Fisher say to\r\nher, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same\r\nthings about Socialism\xe2\x80\x9d; to which she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94but if he\r\ndoes we shall know that he is a knave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd only a few hours after this came election day\xe2\x80\x94when the long\r\ncampaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold\r\nits breath, awaiting the issue. Jurgis and the rest of the staff of\r\nHinds\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they\r\nhurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening.\r\n\r\nBut already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph\r\ninstrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns. When the\r\nfinal accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four\r\nhundred thousand\xe2\x80\x94an increase of something like three hundred and fifty\r\nper cent in four years. And that was doing well; but the party was\r\ndependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and\r\nnaturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones\r\nwhich felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall\r\nbelieved that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight\r\nhundred thousand. Just such an incredible increase had actually been\r\nmade in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700\r\nin 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and\r\nnow it was 69,000! So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in,\r\nthe meeting was a sight to be seen. Bulletins would be read, and the\r\npeople would shout themselves hoarse\xe2\x80\x94and then some one would make a\r\nspeech, and there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and\r\nmore bulletins. There would come messages from the secretaries of\r\nneighboring states, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana\r\nhad gone from 2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of\r\nOhio from 4,800 to 36,000! There were telegrams to the national office\r\nfrom enthusiastic individuals in little towns which had made amazing\r\nand unprecedented increases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26\r\nto 260; Henderson, Kentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14\r\nto 208; Cleo, Oklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin\xe2\x80\x99s Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to\r\n296\xe2\x80\x94and many more of the same kind. There were literally hundreds of\r\nsuch towns; there would be reports from half a dozen of them in a\r\nsingle batch of telegrams. And the men who read the despatches off to\r\nthe audience were old campaigners, who had been to the places and\r\nhelped to make the vote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy,\r\nIllinois, from 189 to 831\xe2\x80\x94that was where the mayor had arrested a\r\nSocialist speaker! Crawford County, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was\r\nthe home of the \xe2\x80\x9cAppeal to Reason\xe2\x80\x9d! Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261\r\nto 10,184; that was the answer of labor to the Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Alliance\r\nMovement!\r\n\r\nAnd then there were official returns from the various precincts and\r\nwards of the city itself! Whether it was a factory district or one of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9csilk-stocking\xe2\x80\x9d wards seemed to make no particular difference in\r\nthe increase; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders\r\nmost was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards.\r\nPackingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the\r\nspring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600.\r\nNow, only one year later, it was over 6,300\xe2\x80\x94and the Democratic vote\r\nonly 8,800! There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had\r\nbeen actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state\r\nlegislature had been elected. Thus Chicago now led the country; it had\r\nset a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes\r\nwere fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every\r\nsentence. The orator had been the head of the city\xe2\x80\x99s relief bureau in\r\nthe stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him\r\nsick. He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his\r\nlong arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of\r\nthe revolution. \xe2\x80\x9cOrganize! Organize! Organize!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was his cry. He\r\nwas afraid of this tremendous vote, which his party had not expected,\r\nand which it had not earned. \xe2\x80\x9cThese men are not Socialists!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will\r\nforget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and\r\nrest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled\r\nto-day, and our enemies will laugh us to scorn! It rests with you to\r\ntake your resolution\xe2\x80\x94now, in the flush of victory, to find these men\r\nwho have voted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize\r\nthem and bind them to us! We shall not find all our campaigns as easy\r\nas this one. Everywhere in the country tonight the old party\r\npoliticians are studying this vote, and setting their sails by it; and\r\nnowhere will they be quicker or more cunning than here in our own city.\r\nFifty thousand Socialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership\r\nDemocracy in the spring! And then they will fool the voters once more,\r\nand all the powers of plunder and corruption will be swept into office\r\nagain! But whatever they may do when they get in, there is one thing\r\nthey will not do, and that will be the thing for which they were\r\nelected! They will not give the people of our city municipal\r\nownership\xe2\x80\x94they will not mean to do it, they will not try to do it; all\r\nthat they will do is give our party in Chicago the greatest opportunity\r\nthat has ever come to Socialism in America! We shall have the sham\r\nreformers self-stultified and self-convicted; we shall have the radical\r\nDemocracy left without a lie with which to cover its nakedness! And\r\nthen will begin the rush that will never be checked, the tide that will\r\nnever turn till it has reached its flood\xe2\x80\x94that will be irresistible,\r\noverwhelming\xe2\x80\x94the rallying of the outraged workingmen of Chicago to our\r\nstandard! And we shall organize them, we shall drill them, we shall\r\nmarshal them for the victory! We shall bear down the opposition, we\r\nshall sweep if before us\xe2\x80\x94and _Chicago will be ours!_ Chicago will be\r\nours! CHICAGO WILL BE OURS!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE JUNGLE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 140-0.txt or 140-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/140/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
