  PREFACE

  TO THE

  FIFTH EDITION.


The great encouragement which has been given by the public to the
previous editions of this little work, satisfactorily proves that,
notwithstanding the extension of serious education to all but the very
earliest periods of life, there still exists an undying love for the
popular remnants of the ancient Scandinavian nursery literature.
The infants and children of the nineteenth century have not, then,
deserted the rhymes chanted so many ages since by the mothers of the
North. This is a "great nursery fact"--a proof that there is contained
in some of these traditional nonsense-rhymes a meaning and a romance,
possibly intelligible only to very young minds, that exercise an
influence on the fancy of children. It is obvious there must exist
something of this kind; for no modern compositions are found to supply
altogether the place of the ancient doggerel.

The nursery rhyme is the novel and light reading of the infant
scholar. It occupies, with respect to the A B C, the position of a
romance which relieves the mind from the cares of a riper age.
The absurdity and frivolity of a rhyme may naturally be its chief
attractions to the very young; and there will be something lost from
the imagination of that child, whose parents insist so much on matters
of fact, that the "cow" must be made, in compliance with the rules
of their educational code, to jump "_under_" instead of "_over_ the
moon;" while of course the little dog must be considered as "barking,"
not "laughing" at the circumstance.

These, or any such objections,--for it seems there are others of
about equal weight,--are, it appears to me, more silly than the worst
nursery rhyme the little readers will meet with in the following
pages. I am quite willing to leave the question to their decision,
feeling assured the catering for them has not been in vain, and
that these cullings from the high-ways and bye-ways--they have been
collected from nearly every county in England--will be to them real
flowers, soothing the misery of many an hour of infantine adversity.

FIRST CLASS--HISTORICAL.


I.

  Old King Cole
  Was a merry old soul,
  And a merry old soul was he;
  He called for his pipe,
  And he called for his bowl,
  And he called for his fiddlers three.
  Every fiddler, he had a fiddle,
  And a very fine fiddle had he;
  Twee tweedle dee, tweedle dee, went the fiddlers.
  Oh, there's none so rare,
  As can compare
  With King Cole and his fiddlers three!

    [The traditional Nursery Rhymes of England commence with a
    legendary satire on King Cole, who reigned in Britain, as the
    old chroniclers inform us, in the third century after Christ.
    According to Robert of Gloucester, he was the father of
    St. Helena, and if so, Butler must be wrong in ascribing an
    obscure origin to the celebrated mother of Constantine. King
    Cole was a brave and popular man in his day, and ascended
    the throne of Britain on the death of Asclepiod, amidst
    the acclamations of the people, or, as Robert of Gloucester
    expresses himself, the "fole was tho of this lond y-paid wel
    y-nou." At Colchester there is a large earthwork, supposed to
    have been a Roman amphitheatre, which goes popularly by
    the name of "King Cole's kitchen." According to Jeffrey of
    Monmouth, King Cole's daughter was well skilled in music, but
    we unfortunately have no evidence to show that her father was
    attached to that science, further than what is contained in
    the foregoing lines, which are of doubtful antiquity. The
    following version of the song is of the seventeenth century,
    the one given above being probably a modernization:--

      Good King Cole,
      He call'd for his bowl,
      And he call'd for fidlers three:
      And there was fiddle fiddle,
      And twice fiddle fiddle,
      For 'twas my lady's birth-day;
      Therefore we keep holiday,
      And come to be merry.]


II.

  When good king Arthur ruled this land,
    He was a goodly king;
  He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
    To make a bag-pudding.

  A bag-pudding the king did make,
    And stuff'd it well with plums:
  And in it put great lumps of fat,
    As big as my two thumbs.

  The king and queen did eat thereof,
    And noblemen beside;
  And what they could not eat that night,
    The queen next morning fried.


III.

    [The following song relating to Robin Hood, the celebrated
    outlaw, is well known at Worksop, in Nottinghamshire, where it
    constitutes one of the nursery series.]

  Robin Hood, Robin Hood,
  Is in the mickle wood!
  Little John, Little John,
  He to the town is gone.

  Robin Hood, Robin Hood,
    Is telling his beads,
  All in the green wood,
    Among the green weeds.

  Little John, Little John,
    If he comes no more,
  Robin Hood, Robin Hood,
    He will fret full sore!


IV.

    [The following lines were obtained in Oxfordshire. The story
    to which it alludes is related by Matthew Paris.]

  One moonshiny night
  As I sat high,
  Waiting for one
  To come by;
  The boughs did bend,
  My heart did ache
  To see what hole the fox did make.


V.

    [The following perhaps refers to Joanna of Castile, who
    visited the court of Henry the Seventh, in the year 1506.]

  I had a little nut tree, nothing would it bear
  But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear;
  The king of Spain's daughter came to visit me,
  And all was because of my little nut tree.
  I skipp'd over water, I danced over sea,
  And all the birds in the air couldn't catch me.


VI.

    [From a MS. in the old Royal Library, in the British Museum,
    the exact reference to which is mislaid. It is written, if I
    recollect rightly, in a hand of the time of Henry VIII, in an
    older manuscript.]

  We make no spare
  Of John Hunkes' mare;
  And now I
  Think she will die;
  He thought it good
  To put her in the wood,
  To seek where she might ly dry;
  If the mare should chance to fale,
  Then the crownes would for her sale.


VII.

    [From MS. Sloane, 1489, fol. 19, written in the time of
    Charles I.]

  The king of France, and four thousand men,
  They drew their swords, and put them up again.


VIII.

    [In a tract, called 'Pigges Corantoe, or Newes from the
    North,' 4to Lond. 1642, p. 3, this is called "Old Tarlton's
    Song." It is perhaps a parody on the popular epigram of "Jack
    and Jill." I do not know the period of the battle to which it
    appears to allude, but Tarlton died in the year 1588, so that
    the rhyme must be earlier.]

  The king of France went up the hill,
    With twenty thousand men;
  The king of France came down the hill,
    And ne'er went up again.


IX.

  The king of France, with twenty thousand men,
  Went up the hill, and then came down again;
  The king of Spain, with twenty thousand more,
  Climb'd the same hill the French had climb'd before.


X.

    [Another version. The nurse sings the first line, and repeats
    it, time after time, until the expectant little one asks, what
    next? Then comes the climax.]

  The king of France, the king of France, with forty thousand men,
  Oh, they all went up the hill, and so--came back again!


XI.

  At the siege of Belle-isle
  I was there all the while,
  All the while, all the while,
  At the siege of Belle-isle.


XII.

    [The tune to the following may be found in the 'English
    Dancing Master,' 1631, p. 37.]

  The rose is red, the grass is green,
  Serve Queen Bess our noble queen;
      Kitty the spinner
      Will sit down to dinner,
  And eat the leg of a frog;
      All good people
      Look over the steeple,
  And see the cat play with the dog.


XIII.

  Good Queen Bess was a glorious dame,
  When bonny King Jemmy from Scotland came;
  We'll pepper their bodies,
  Their peaceable noddies,
  And give them a crack of the crown!


XIV.

    [The word _tory_ has changed greatly in its meaning, as it
    originated in the reign of Elizabeth, and represented a class
    of "bog-trotters," who were a compound of the knave and the
    highwayman. For many interesting particulars see Crofton
    Croker's 'Researches in the South of Ireland,' 4to, 1824, p.
    52.]

  Ho! Master Teague, what is your story?
  I went to the wood and kill'd a _tory_;
  I went to the wood and kill'd another;
  Was it the same, or was it his brother?

  I hunted him in, and I hunted him out,
  Three times through the bog, about and about;
  When out of a bush I saw his head,
  So I fired my gun, and I shot him dead.


XV.

  Please to remember
  The fifth of November,
    Gunpowder treason and plot;
  I know no reason
  Why gunpowder treason
    Should ever be forgot.


XVI.

    [Taken from MS. Douce, 357, fol. 124. See Echard's 'History of
    England,' book iii, chap. 1.]

  See saw, sack-a-day;
  Monmouth is a pretie boy,
    Richmond is another,
  Grafton is my onely joy,
  And why should I these three destroy,
    To please a pious brother!


XVII.

  Over the water, and over the lee,
  And over the water to Charley.
  Charley loves good ale and wine,
  And Charley loves good brandy,
  And Charley loves a pretty girl,
  As sweet as sugar-candy.

  Over the water, and over the sea,
  And over the water to Charley,
  I'll have none of your nasty beef,
  Nor I'll have none of your barley;
  But I'll have some of your very best flour;
  To make a white cake for my Charley.


XVIII.

    [The following is partly quoted in an old song in a MS. at
    Oxford, Ashmole, No. 36, fol. 113.]

  As I was going by Charing Cross,
  I saw a black man upon a black horse;
  They told me it was King Charles the First;
  Oh dear! my heart was ready to burst!


XIX.

  High diddle ding,
  Did you hear the bells ring?
  The parliament soldiers are gone to the king!
  Some they did laugh, some they did cry,
  To see the parliament soldiers pass by.


XX.

  High ding a ding, and ho ding a ding,
  The parliament soldiers are gone to the king;
  Some with new beavers, some with new bands,
  The parliament soldiers are all to be hang'd.


XXI.

  Hector Protector was dressed all in green;
  Hector Protector was sent to the Queen.
  The Queen did not like him,
  Nor more did the King:
  So Hector Protector was sent back again.


XXII.

    [The following is a fragment of a song on the subject, which
    was introduced by Russell in the character of Jerry Sneak.]

  Poor old Robinson Crusoe!
  Poor old Robinson Crusoe!
  They made him a coat
  Of an old nanny goat,
    I wonder how they could do so!
  With a ring a ting tang,
  And a ring a ting tang,
    Poor old Robinson Crusoe!


XXIII.

    [Written on occasion of the marriage of Mary, the daughter of
    James duke of York, afterwards James II, with the young Prince
    of Orange. The song from which these lines are taken may be
    seen in 'The Jacobite Minstrelsy,' 12mo, Glasgow, 1828, p.
    28.]

  What is the rhyme for _poringer?_
  The king he had a daughter fair,
  And gave the Prince of Orange her.


XXIV.

    [The following nursery song alludes to William III and George
    prince of Denmark.]

  William and Mary, George and Anne,
  Four such children had never a man:
  They put their father to flight and shame,
  And call'd their brother a shocking bad name.


XXV.

    [A song on King William the Third.]

  As I walk'd by myself,
  And talked to myself,
    Myself said unto me,
  Look to thyself,
  Take care of thyself,
    For nobody cares for thee.

  I answer'd myself,
  And said to myself
    In the self-same repartee,
  Look to thyself,
  Or not look to thyself,
    The self-same thing will be.


XXVI.

    [From MS. Sloane, 1489, fol. 19, written in the time of
    Charles I. It appears from MS. Harl. 390, fol. 85, that these
    verses were written in 1626, against the Duke of Buckingham.]

  There was a monkey climb'd up a tree,
  When he fell down, then down fell he.

  There was a crow sat on a stone,
  When he was gone, then there was none.

  There was an old wife did eat an apple,
  When she had eat two, she had eat a couple.

  There was a horse going to the mill,
  When he went on, he stood not still.

  There was a butcher cut his thumb,
  When it did bleed, then blood did come.

  There was a lackey ran a race,
  When he ran fast, he ran apace.

  There was a cobbler clowting shoon,
  When they were mended, they were done.

  There was a chandler making candle,
  When he them strip, he did them handle.

  There was a navy went into Spain,
  When it return'd it came again.


XXVII.

    [The following may possibly allude to King George and the
    Pretender.]

  Jim and George were two great lords,
    They fought all in a churn;
  And when that Jim got George by the nose,
    Then George began to gern.


XXVIII.

      Little General Monk
      Sat upon a trunk,
  Eating a crust of bread;
      There fell a hot coal
      And burnt in his clothes a hole,
  Now General Monk is dead.
      Keep always from the fire:
      If it catch your attire,
  You too, like Monk, will be dead.


XXIX.

  Eighty-eight wor Kirby feight,
  When nivver a man was slain;
  They yatt their meaat, an drank ther drink
  An sae com merrily heaam agayn.

THIRD CLASS--TALES.


XLV.

THE STORY OF CATSKIN.

  There once was a gentleman grand,
    Who lived at his country seat;
  He wanted an heir to his land,
    For he'd nothing but daughters yet.

  His lady's again in the way,
    So she said to her husband with joy,
  "I hope some or other fine day,
    To present you, my dear, with a boy."

  The gentleman answered gruff,
    "If 't should turn out a maid or a mouse,
  For of both we have more than enough,
    She shan't stay to live in my house."

  The lady, at this declaration,
    Almost fainted away with pain;
  But what was her sad consternation,
    When a sweet little girl came again.

  She sent her away to be nurs'd,
    Without seeing her gruff papa;
  And when she was old enough,
    To a school she was packed away.

  Fifteen summers are fled,
    Now she left good Mrs. Jervis;
  To see home she was forbid,--
    She determined to go and seek service.

  Her dresses so grand and so gay,
    She carefully rolled in a knob;
  Which she hid in a forest away,
    And put on a Catskin robe.

  She knock'd at a castle gate,
    And pray'd for charity;
  They sent her some meat on a plate,
    And kept her a scullion to be.

  My lady look'd long in her face,
    And prais'd her great beauty;
  I'm sorry I've no better place,
    And you must our scullion be.

  So Catskin was under the cook,
    A very sad life she led,
  For often a ladle she took,
    And broke poor Catskin's head.

  There is now a grand ball to be,
    When ladies their beauties show;
  "Mrs. Cook," said Catskin, "dear me,
    How much I should like to go!"

  "You go with your Catskin robe,
    You dirty impudent slut!
  Among the fine ladies and lords,
    A very fine figure you'd cut."

  A basin of water she took,
    And dash'd in poor Catskin's face;
  But briskly her ears she shook,
    And went to her hiding-place.

  She washed every stain from her skin,
    In some crystal waterfall;
  Then put on a beautiful dress,
    And hasted away to the ball.

  When she entered, the ladies were mute,
    Overcome by her figure and face;
  But the lord, her young master, at once
    Fell in love with her beauty and grace;

  He pray'd her his partner to be,
    She said, "Yes!" with a sweet smiling glance;
  All night with no other lady
    But Catskin, our young lord would dance.

  "Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?"
    For now was the sad parting time;
  But she no other answer would give,
    Than this distich of mystical rhyme,--

  [Old English Script:
  Kind Sir, if the truth I must tell,
  At the sign of the Basin of Water I Dwell.]

  Then she flew from the ball-room, and put
    On her Catskin robe again;
  And slipt in unseen by the cook,
    Who little thought where she had been.

  The young lord, the very next day,
    To his mother his passion betrayed;
  He declared he never would rest,
    Till he'd found out this beautiful maid.

  There's another grand ball to be,
    Where ladies their beauties show;
  "Mrs. Cook," said Catskin, "dear me,
    How much I should like to go!"

  "You go with your Catskin robe,
    You dirty impudent slut!
  Among the fine ladies and lords,
    A very fine figure you'd cut."

  In a rage the ladle she took,
    And broke poor Catskin's head;
  But off she went shaking her ears,
    And swift to her forest she fled.

  She washed every blood-stain off
    In some crystal waterfall;
  Put on a more beautiful dress,
    And hasted away to the ball.

  My lord, at the ball-room door,
    Was waiting with pleasure and pain;
  He longed to see nothing so much
    As the beautiful Catskin again.

  When he asked her to dance, she again
    Said "Yes!" with her first smiling glance;
  And again, all the night, my young lord
    With none but fair Catskin did dance.

  "Pray tell me," said he, "where you live?"
    For now 'twas the parting-time;
  But she no other answer would give,
    Than this distich of mystical rhyme,--

  [Old English Script:
  Kind Sir, if the truth I must tell,
  At the sign of the Broken-Ladle I dwell.]

  Then she flew from the ball, and put on
    Her Catskin robe again;
  And slipt in unseen by the cook,
    Who little thought where she had been.

  My lord did again, the next day,
    Declare to his mother his mind,
  That he never more happy should be,
    Unless he his charmer should find.

  Now another grand ball is to be,
    Where ladies their beauties show;
  "Mrs. Cook," said Catskin, "dear me,
    How much I should like to go!"

  "You go with your Catskin robe,
    You impudent, dirty slut!
  Among the fine ladies and lords,
    A very fine figure you'd cut."

  In a fury she took the skimmer,
    And broke poor Catskin's head;
  But heart-whole and lively as ever,
    Away to her forest she fled.

  She washed the stains of blood
    In some crystal waterfall;
  Then put on her most beautiful dress,
    And hasted away to the ball.

  My lord, at the ball-room door,
    Was waiting with pleasure and pain;
  He longed to see nothing so much
    As the beautiful Catskin again.

  When he asked her to dance, she again
    Said "Yes!" with her first smiling glance;
  And all the night long, my young lord
    With none but fair Catskin would dance.

  "Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?"
    For now was the parting-time;
  But she no other answer would give,
    Than this distich of mystical rhyme,--

  [Old English Script:
  Kind Sir, if the truth I must tell,
  At the sign of the Broken-Skimmer I dwell.]

  Then she flew from the ball, and threw on
    Her Catskin cloak again;
  And slipt in unseen by the cook,
    Who little thought where she had been.

  But not by my lord unseen,
    For this time he followed too fast;
  And, hid in the forest green,
    Saw the strange things that past.

  Next day he took to his bed,
    And sent for the doctor to come;
  And begg'd him no other than Catskin,
    Might come into his room.

  He told him how dearly he lov'd her,
    Not to have her his heart would break:
  Then the doctor kindly promised
    To the proud old lady to speak.

  There's a struggle of pride and love,
    For she fear'd her son would die;
  But pride at the last did yield,
    And love had the mastery.

  Then my lord got quickly well,
    When he was his charmer to wed;
  And Catskin, before a twelvemonth,
    Of a young lord was brought to bed.

  To a wayfaring woman and child,
    Lady Catskin one day sent an alms;
  The nurse did the errand, and carried
    The sweet little lord in her arms.

  The child gave the alms to the child,
    This was seen by the old lady-mother;
  "Only see," said that wicked old woman,
    "How the beggars' brats take to each other!"

  This throw went to Catskin's heart,
    She flung herself down on her knees,
  And pray'd her young master and lord
    To seek out her parents would please.

  They set out in my lord's own coach;
    They travelled, but nought befel
  Till they reach'd the town hard by,
    Where Catskin's father did dwell.

  They put up at the head inn,
    Where Catskin was left alone;
  But my lord went to try if her father
    His natural child would own.

  When folks are away, in short time
    What great alterations appear;
  For the cold touch of death had all chill'd
    The hearts of her sisters dear.

  Her father repented too late,
    And the loss of his youngest bemoan'd;
  In his old and childless state,
    He his pride and cruelty own'd.

  The old gentleman sat by the fire,
    And hardly looked up at my lord;
  He had no hopes of comfort
    A stranger could afford.

  But my lord drew a chair close by,
    And said, in a feeling tone,
  "Have you not, sir, a daughter, I pray,
    You never would see or own?"

  The old man alarm'd, cried aloud,
    "A hardened sinner am I!
  I would give all my worldly goods,
    To see her before I die."

  Then my lord brought his wife and child
    To their home and parent's face,
  Who fell down and thanks returned
    To God, for his mercy and grace.

  The bells, ringing up in the tower,
    Are sending a sound to the heart;
  There's a charm in the old church-bells,
    Which nothing in life can impart!

  Were stolen away on a fine summer's day,
  And left in a wood, as I've heard people say.

        And when it was night,
        So sad was their plight,
          The sun it went down,
        And the moon gave no light!
  They sobb'd and they sigh'd, and they bitterly cried,
  And the poor little things, they lay down and died.

        And when they were dead,
        The Robins so red
          Brought strawberry leaves,
        And over them spread;
          And all the day long,

  "Poor babes in the wood! poor babes in the wood!

  While he went back,
  To fetch the little drake;
  But when he got there,
  The drake was fled for fear,
  And like an old novice,
  He turn'd back again.

THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.

Once upon a time there was an old sow with three little pigs, and
as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their
fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and
said to him, "Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house;"
which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it. Presently
came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said,--

"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."

To which the pig answered,--

"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin."

The wolf then answered to that,--

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."

So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and eat up the
little pig.

The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said,
"Please, man, give me that furze to build a house;" which the man did,
and the pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, and said,--

"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."

"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin."

"Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in."

So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last
he blew the house down, and he eat up the little pig.

The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said,
"Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with;" so the man
gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the wolf
came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said,--

"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."

"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin."

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."

Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he
puffed, and he huffed; but he could _not_ get the house down. When he
found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the
house down, he said, "Little pig, I know where there is a nice
field of turnips." "Where?" said the little pig. "Oh, in Mr. Smith's
Home-field, and if you will be ready to-morrow morning I will call for
you, and we will go together, and get some for dinner." "Very well,"
said the little pig, "I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?"
"Oh, at six o'clock." Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the
turnips before the wolf came--(which he did about six)--and who said,
"Little pig, are you ready?" The little pig said, "Ready! I have been,
and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner." The wolf
felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be _up to_ the
little pig somehow or other, so he said, "Little pig, I know
where there is a nice apple-tree." "Where?" said the pig. "Down at
Merry-garden," replied the wolf, "and if you will not deceive me I
will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together
and get some apples." Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning
at four o'clock, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back
before the wolf came; but he had further to go, and had to climb the
tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf
coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When the
wolf came up he said, "Little pig, what! are you here before me? Are
they nice apples?" "Yes, very," said the little pig. "I will throw you
down one;" and he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to
pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the
wolf came again, and said to the little pig, "Little pig, there is a
fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?" "Oh yes," said the pig,
"I will go; what time shall you be ready?" "At three," said the wolf.
So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the
fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he
saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into
the churn to hide, and by so doing turned it round, and it rolled down
the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much, that
he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's
house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing
which came down the hill past him. Then the little pig said, "Hah, I
frightened you then. I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn,
and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the hill." Then the
wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he _would_ eat up the little
pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little
pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made
up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, took off the
cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover again
in an instant, boiled him up, and eat him for supper, and lived happy
ever afterwards.

LXI.

  In Arthur's court Tom Thumb[*] did live,
    A man of mickle might;
  The best of all the table round,
    And eke a doughty knight.

  His stature but an inch in height,
    Or quarter of a span;
  Then think you not this little knight
    Was proved a valiant man?

  His father was a ploughman plain,
    His mother milk'd the cow,
  Yet how that they might have a son
    They knew not what to do:

  Until such time this good old man
    To learned Merlin goes,
  And there to him his deep desires
    In secret manner shows.

  How in his heart he wish'd to have
    A child, in time to come,
  To be his heir, though it might be
    No bigger than his thumb.

  Of which old Merlin thus foretold,
    That he his wish should have,
  And so this son of stature small
    The charmer to him gave.

  No blood nor bones in him should be,
    In shape, and being such
  That men should hear him speak, but not
    His wandering shadow touch.

  But so unseen to go or come,--
    Whereas it pleas'd him still;
  Begot and born in half an hour,
    To fit his father's will.

  And in four minutes grew so fast
    That he became so tall
  As was the ploughman's thumb in height,
    And so they did him call--

  TOM THUMB, the which the fairy queen
    There gave him to his name,
  Who, with her train of goblins grim,
    Unto his christening came.

  Whereas she cloth'd him richly brave,
    In garments fine and fair,
  Which lasted him for many years
    In seemly sort to wear.

  His hat made of an oaken leaf,
    His shirt a spider's web,
  Both light and soft for those his limbs
    That were so smally bred.

  His hose and doublet thistle-down,
    Together weaved full fine;
  His stockings of an apple green,
    Made of the outward rind;

  His garters were two little hairs
    Pull'd from his mother's eye;
  His boots and shoes, a mouse's skin,
    Were tann'd most curiously

  Thus like a lusty gallant, he
    Adventured forth to go,
  With other children in the streets,
    His pretty tricks to show.

  Where he for counters, pins, and points,
    And cherry-stones did play,
  Till he amongst those gamesters young
    Had lost his stock away.

  Yet could he soon renew the same,
    Whereas most nimbly he
  Would dive into their cherry-bags,
    And their partaker be,

  Unseen or felt by any one,
    Until this scholar shut
  This nimble youth into a box,
    Wherein his pins he put.

  Of whom to be reveng'd, he took,
    In mirth and pleasant game,
  Black pots and glasses, which he hung
    Upon a bright sun-beam.

  The other boys to do the like,
    In pieces broke them quite;
  For which they were most soundly whipt;
    Whereat he laughed outright.

  And so Tom Thumb restrained was,
    From these his sports and play;
  And by his mother after that,
    Compell'd at home to stay.

  Until such time his mother went
    A-milking of her kine;
  Where Tom unto a thistle fast
    She linked with a twine.

  A thread that held him to the same,
    For fear the blustering wind
  Should blow him hence,--that so she might
    Her son in safety find.

  But mark the hap! a cow came by,
    And up the thistle eat;
  Poor Tom withal, that, as a dock,
    Was made the red cow's meat.

  Who, being miss'd, his mother went
    Him calling everywhere;
  Where art thou, Tom? Where art thou, Tom?
    Quoth he, here, mother, here!

  Within the red cow's stomach here,
    Your son is swallowed up:
  The which into her fearful heart,
    Most careful dolours put.

  Meanwhile the cow was troubled much,
    And soon releas'd Tom Thumb;
  No rest she had till out her mouth,
    In bad plight he did come.

  Now after this, in sowing time,
    His father would him have
  Into the field to drive his plough,
    And thereupon him gave--

  A whip made of a barley-straw,
    To drive the cattle on;
  Where, in a furrow'd land new sown,
    Poor Tom was lost and gone.

  Now by a raven of great strength,
    Away he thence was borne,
  And carried in the carrion's beak,
    Even like a grain of corn,

  Unto a giant's castle top,
    In which he let him fall;
  Where soon the giant swallowed up
    His body, clothes, and all.

  But soon the giant spat him out,
    Three miles into the sea;
  Whereas a fish soon took him up,
    And bore him thence away.

  Which lusty fish was after caught,
    And to king Arthur sent;
  Where Tom was found, and made his dwarf,
    Whereas his days he spent.

  Long time in lively jollity,
    Belov'd of all the court;
  And none like Tom was then esteem'd,
    Among the noble sort.

  Amongst his deeds of courtship done,
    His highness did command,
  That he should dance a galliard brave
    Upon his queen's left hand.

  The which he did, and for the same
    The king his signet gave,
  Which Tom about his middle wore,
    Long time a girdle brave.

  How, after this, the king would not
    Abroad for pleasure go
  But still Tom Thumb must ride with him,
    Placed on his saddle-bow.

  Whereon a time when, as it rain'd,
    Tom Thumb most nimbly crept
  In at a button-hole, where he
    Within his bosom slept.

  And being near his highness' heart,
    He crav'd a wealthy boon,
  A liberal gift, the which the king
    Commanded to be done.

  For to relieve his father's wants,
    And mother's, being old;
  Which was, so much of silver coin
    As well his arms could hold.

  And so away goes lusty Tom,
    With threepence on his back,
  A heavy burthen, which might make
    His wearied limbs to crack.

  So travelling two days and nights,
    With labour and great pain,
  He came into the house whereat
    His parents did remain;

  Which was but half a mile in space
    From good king Arthur's court,
  The which, in eight and forty hours,
    He went in weary sort.

  But coming to his father's door,
    He there such entrance had
  As made his parents both rejoice,
    And he thereat was glad.

  His mother in her apron took
    Her gentle son in haste,
  And by the fire-side, within
    A walnut-shell him placed;

  Whereas they feasted him three days
    Upon a hazel-nut,
  Whereon he rioted so long,
    He them to charges put;

  And thereupon grew wond'rous sick,
    Through eating too much meat,
  Which was sufficient for a month
    For this great man to eat.

  But now his business call'd him forth
    King Arthur's court to see,
  Whereas no longer from the same
    He could a stranger be.

  But yet a few small April drops
    Which settled in the way,
  His long and weary journey forth
    Did hinder and so stay.

  Until his careful father took
    A birding trunk in sport,
  And with one blast, blew this his son
    Into king Arthur's court.

  Now he with tilts and tournaments
    Was entertained so,
  That all the best of Arthur's knights
    Did him much pleasure show:

  As good Sir Lancelot du Lake,
    Sir Tristain, and Sir Guy;
  Yet none compar'd with brave Tom Thumb
    For knightly chivalry.

  In honour of which noble day,
    And for his lady's sake,
  A challenge in king Arthur's court
    Tom Thumb did bravely make.

  'Gainst whom these noble knights did run,
    Sir Chinon and the rest,
  Yet still Tom Thumb, with matchless might,
    Did bear away the best.

  At last Sir Lancelot du Lake
    In manly sort came in,
  And with this stout and hardy knight
    A battle did begin.

  Which made the courtiers all aghast,
    For there that valiant man,
  Through Lancelot's steed, before them all,
    In nimble manner ran.

  Yea, horse and all, with spear and shield,
    As hardy he was seen,
  But only by king Arthur's self
    And his admired queen;

  Who from her finger took a ring,
    Through which Tom Thumb made way,
  Not touching it, in nimble sort,
    As it was done in play.

  He likewise cleft the smallest hair
    From his fair lady's head,
  Not hurting her whose even hand
    Him lasting honours bred.

  Such were his deeds and noble acts
    In Arthur's court there shone,
  As like in all the world beside
    Was hardly seen or known.

  Now at these sports he toil'd himself,
    That he a sickness took,
  Through which all manly exercise
    He carelessly forsook.

  When lying on his bed sore sick,
    King Arthur's doctor came,
  With cunning skill, by physic's art,
    To ease and cure the same.

  His body being so slender small,
    This cunning doctor took
  A fine perspective glass, with which
    He did in secret look--

  Into his sickened body down,
    And therein saw that Death
  Stood ready in his wasted frame
    To cease his vital breath.

  His arms and legs consum'd as small
    As was a spider's web,
  Through which his dying hour grew on,
    For all his limbs grew dead.

  His face no bigger than an ant's,
    Which hardly could be seen;
  The loss of which renowned knight
    Much grieved the king and queen.

  And so with peace and quietness
    He left this earth below;
  And up into the fairy-land
    His ghost did fading go,

  Whereas the fairy-queen receiv'd,
    With heavy mourning cheer,
  The body of this valiant knight,
    Whom she esteem'd so dear.

  For with her dancing nymphs in green,
    She fetch'd him from his bed,
  With music and sweet melody,
    So soon as life was fled;

  For whom king Arthur and his knights
    Full forty days did mourn;
  And, in remembrance of his name,
    That was so strangely born--

  He built a tomb of marble gray,
    And year by year did come
  To celebrate ye mournful death
    And burial of Tom Thumb.

  Whose fame still lives in England here,
    Amongst the country sort;
  Of whom our wives and children small
    Tell tales of pleasant sport.

    Life and Death; wherein is declar'd his many marvellous Acts
    of Manhood, full of wonder and strange merriment.' Then he
    adds, 'Which little Knight liv'd in King Arthur's time, in the
    court of Great Britain.' Indeed, there are so many spurious
    editions of this piece upon one account or other, that I wou'd
    advise my readers to be very cautious in their choice."--_A
    Comment upon the History of T. T._ 1711. A "project for the
    reprinting of Tom Thumb, with marginal notes and cuts," is
    mentioned in the old play of _The Projectours_, 1665, p. 41.]

    [The following lines, slightly altered, occur in a little
    black-letter book by W. Wagner, printed about the year 1561;
    entitled, 'A very mery and pythie commedie, called, the longer
    thou livest, the more foole thou art.' See also a whole
    song, ending with these lines, in Ritson's 'North Country
    Chorister,' 8vo, Durham, 1802, p. 1.]

  They all went over a bridge together:
  The bridge was broken, and they all fell in,
  The deuce go with all! quoth Bryan O'Lin.


LXIII.

  Old Mother Goose, when
  She wanted to wander,
  Would ride through the air
  On a very fine gander.

  Mother Goose had a house,
  'Twas built in a wood,
  Where an owl at the door
  For sentinel stood.

  This is her son Jack,
  A plain-looking lad,
  He is not very good,
  Nor yet very bad.

  She sent him to market,
  A live goose he bought,
  Here, mother, says he,
  It will not go for nought.

  Jack's goose and her gander,
  Grew very fond;
  They'd both eat together,
  Or swim in one pond.

  Jack found one morning,
  As I have been told,
  His goose had laid him
  An egg of pure gold.

  Jack rode to his mother,
  The news for to tell,
  She call'd him a good boy,
  And said it was well.

  Jack sold his gold egg
  To a rogue of a Jew,
  Who cheated him out of
  The half of his due.

  Then Jack went a courting,
  A lady so gay,
  As fair as the lily,
  And sweet as the May.

  The Jew and the Squire
  Came behind his back,
  And began to belabour
  The sides of poor Jack.

  The old Mother Goose,
  That instant came in,
  And turned her son Jack
  Into fam'd Harlequin.

  She then with her wand,
  Touch'd the lady so fine,
  And turn'd her at once
  Into sweet Columbine.

  The gold egg into the sea
  Was thrown then,--
  When Jack jump'd in,
  And got the egg back again.

  The Jew got the goose,
  Which he vow'd he would kill,
  Resolving at once
  His pockets to fill.

  Jack's mother came in,
  And caught the goose soon,
  And mounting its back,
  Flew up to the moon.


LXIV.

    I'll tell you a story
    About Jack a Nory,--
  And now my story's begun:
    I'll tell you another
    About Jack his brother,--
  And now my story's done.


LXV.

    [The "foles of Gotham" are mentioned as early as the fifteenth
    century in the 'Townley Mysteries;' and, at the commencement
    of the sixteenth century, Dr. Andrew Borde made a collection
    of stories about them, not however, including the following,
    which rests on the authority of nursery tradition.]

  Three wise men of Gotham
  Went to sea in a bowl:
  And if the bowl had been stronger,
  My song would have been longer.


LXVI.

    [The following two stanzas, although they belong to the same
    piece, are often found separated from each other.]

  Robin and Richard were two pretty men;
  They laid in bed till the clock struck ten;
  Then up starts Robin, and looks at the sky,
  Oh! brother Richard, the sun's very high:

  The bull's in the barn threshing the corn,
  The cock's on the dunghill blowing his horn,
  The cat's at the fire frying of fish,
  The dog's in the pantry breading his dish.


LXVII.

  My lady Wind, my lady Wind,
  Went round about the house to find
    A chink to get her foot in:
  She tried the key-hole in the door,
  She tried the crevice in the floor,
    And drove the chimney soot in.

  And then one night when it was dark,
  She blew up such a tiny spark,
    That all the house was pothered:
  From it she raised up such a flame,
  As flamed away to Belting Lane,
    And White Cross folks were smothered.

  And thus when once, my little dears,
  A whisper reaches itching ears,
    The same will come, you'll find:
  Take my advice, restrain the tongue,
  Remember what old nurse has sung
    Of busy lady Wind!


LXVIII.

  Old Abram Brown is dead and gone,
    You'll never see him more;
  He used to wear a long brown coat,
    That button'd down before.


LXIX.

  A dog and a cock,
  A journey once took,
    They travell'd along till 'twas late;
  The dog he made free
  In the hollow of a tree,
    And the cock on the boughs of it sate.

  The cock nothing knowing,
  In the morn fell a crowing,
    Upon which comes a fox to the tree;
  Says he, I declare,
  Your voice is above,
    All the creatures I ever did see.

  Oh! would you come down
  I the fav'rite might own,
    Said the cock, there's a porter below;
  If you will go in,
  I promise I'll come down.
    So he went--and was worried for it too.

  Tommy gave him such a knock,
  That sent him out of his chandler's shop,

  When I was a little girl, about seven years old,
  I hadn't got a petticoat, to cover me from the cold;
  So I went into Darlington, that pretty little town,
  And there I bought a petticoat, a cloak, and a gown.
  I went into the woods and built me a kirk,
  And all the birds of the air, they helped me to work;
  The hawk with his long claws pulled down the stone,
  The dove, with her rough bill, brought me them home;
  The parrot was the clergyman, the peacock was the clerk,
  The bullfinch play'd the organ, and we made merry work.


LXXIII.

  Pemmy was a pretty girl,
    But Fanny was a better;
  Pemmy looked like any churl,
    When little Fanny let her.

  Pemmy had a pretty nose,
    But Fanny had a better;
  Pemmy oft would come to blows,
    But Fanny would not let her.

  Pemmy had a pretty doll,
    But Fanny had a better;
  Pemmy chatter'd like a poll,
    When little Fanny let her.

  Pemmy had a pretty song,
    But Fanny had a better;
  Pemmy would sing all day long,
    But Fanny would not let her.

  Pemmy lov'd a pretty lad,
    And Fanny lov'd a better;
  And Pemmy wanted for to wed,
    But Fanny would not let her.

    [A tale for the 1st of March.]

  Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief;
  Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef:
  I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was not at home;
  Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow-bone.

  I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was not in;
  Taffy came to my house and stole a silver pin:
  I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed,
  I took up a poker and flung it at his head.

    [The tale of Jack Horner has long been appropriated to the
    nursery. The four lines which follow are the traditional ones,
    and they form part of 'The pleasant History of Jack Horner,
    containing his witty Tricks and pleasant Pranks, which he
    plaied from his Youth to his riper Years,' 12mo, a copy of
    which is in the Bodleian Library, and this extended story
    is in substance the same with 'The Fryer and the Boy,' 12mo,
    Lond. 1617, and both of them are taken from the more ancient
    story of 'Jack and his Step-dame,' which has been printed by
    Mr. Wright.]

  Little Jack Horner sat in the corner,
    Eating a Christmas pie;
  He put in his thumb, and he took out a plum,
    And said, "What a good boy am I!"


LXXVI.

  There was a king and he had three daughter,
  And they all lived in a basin of water;

    The man in the moon,
    Came tumbling down,
  And ask'd his way to Norwich,
    He went by the south,

  With supping cold pease-porridge.


LXXVIII.

  Our saucy boy Dick,
  Had a nice little stick
    Cut from a hawthorn tree;
  And with this pretty stick,
  He thought he could beat
    A boy much bigger than he.

  But the boy turned round,
  And hit him a rebound,
    Which did so frighten poor Dick,
  That, without more delay,
  He ran quite away,
    And over a hedge he jumped quick.


LXXIX.

  Moss was a little man, and a little mare did buy,
  For kicking and for sprawling none her could come nigh;
  She could trot, she could amble, and could canter here and there,
  But one night she strayed away--so Moss lost his mare.

  Moss got up next morning to catch her fast asleep,
  And round about the frosty fields so nimbly he did creep.
  Dead in a ditch he found her, and glad to find her there,
  So I'll tell you by and bye, how Moss caught his mare.

  Rise! stupid, rise! he thus to her did say;
  Arise, you beast, you drowsy beast, get up without delay,
  For I must ride you to the town, so don't lie sleeping there;
  He put the halter round her neck--so Moss caught his mare.

    [One version of the following song, which I believe to be the
    genuine one, is written on the last leaf of MS. Harl. 6580,
    between the lines of a fragment of an old charter, originally
    used for binding the book, in a hand of the end of the
    seventeenth century, but unfortunately it is scarcely adapted
    for the "ears polite" of modern days.]

  A man of words and not of deeds,
  Is like a garden full of weeds;
  And when the weeds begin to grow,
  It's like a garden full of snow;
  And when the snow begins to fall,
  It's like a bird upon the wall;
  And when the bird away does fly,
  It's like an eagle in the sky;
  And when the sky begins to roar,
  It's like a lion at the door;
  And when the door begins to crack,
  It's like a stick across your back;
  And when your back begins to smart,
  It's like a penknife in your heart;
  And when your heart begins to bleed,
  You're dead, and dead, and dead, indeed.

  One misty moisty morning
  When cloudy was the weather,
  There I met an old man
  Clothed all in leather;
  Clothed all in leather,
  With cap under his chin,--
  How do you do, and how do you do,
  And how do you do again!


CXXXIII.

  The fox and his wife they had a great strife,
  They never eat mustard in all their whole life;
  They eat their meat without fork or knife,
    And loved to be picking a bone, e-ho!

  The fox jumped up on a moonlight night;
  The stars they were shining, and all things bright;
  Oh, ho! said the fox, it's a very fine night
    For me to go through the town, e-ho!

  The fox when he came to yonder stile,
  He lifted his lugs and he listened a while!
  Oh, ho! said the fox, it's but a short mile
    From this unto yonder wee town, e-ho!

  The fox when he came to the farmer's gate,
  Who should he see but the farmer's drake;
  I love you well for your master's sake,
    And long to be picking your bone, e-ho!

  The gray goose she ran round the hay-stack,
  Oh, ho! said the fox, you are very fat;
  You'll grease my beard and ride on my back
    From this into yonder wee town, e-ho!

  Old Gammer Hipple-hopple hopped out of bed,
  She opened the casement, and popped out her head;
  Oh! husband, oh! husband, the gray goose is dead,
    And the fox is gone through the town, oh!

  Then the old man got up in his red cap,
  And swore he would catch the fox in a trap;
  But the fox was too cunning, and gave him the slip,
    And ran thro' the town, the town, oh!

  When he got to the top of the hill,
  He blew his trumpet both loud and shrill,
  For joy that he was safe
    Thro' the town, oh!

  When the fox came back to his den,
  He had young ones both nine and ten,
  "You're welcome home, daddy, you may go again,
  If you bring us such nice meat
    From the town, oh!"


CXXXIV.

  Little Tom Dogget,
    What dost thou mean,
  To kill thy poor Colly
    Now she's so lean?
  Sing, oh poor Colly,
    Colly, my cow,
  For Colly will give me
    No more milk now.

  I had better have kept her,
    'Till fatter she had been,
  For now, I confess,
    She's a little too lean.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  First in comes the tanner
    With his sword by his side,
  And he bids me five shillings
    For my poor cow's hide.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  Then in comes the tallow-chandler,
    Whose brains were but shallow,
  And he bids me two-and-sixpence
    For my cow's tallow.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  Then in comes the huntsman
    So early in the morn,
  He bids me a penny
    For my cow's horn.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  Then in comes the tripe-woman,
    So fine and so neat,
  She bids me three half-pence
    For my cow's feet.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  Then in comes the butcher,
    That nimble-tongu'd youth,
  Who said she was carrion,
    But he spoke not the truth.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  The skin of my cowly
    Was softer than silk,
  And three times a-day
    My poor cow would give milk.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  She every year
    A fine calf did me bring,
  Which fetcht me a pound,
    For it came in the spring.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  But now I have kill'd her,
    I can't her recall;
  I will sell my poor Colly,
    Hide, horns, and all.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  The butcher shall have her,
    Though he gives but a pound,
  And he knows in his heart
    That my Colly was sound.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.

  And when he has bought her
    Let him sell all together,
  The flesh for to eat,
    And the hide for leather.
  Sing, oh poor Colly, &c.[*]

    [Footnote *: A different version of the above, commencing,
    My Billy Aroms, is current in the nurseries of Cornwall. One
    verse runs as follows:

      In comes the horner,
        Who roguery scorns,
      And gives me three farthings
        For poor cowly's horns.

    This is better than our reading, and it concludes thus:

      There's an end to my cowly,
        Now she's dead and gone;
      For the loss of my cowly,
        I sob and I mourn.]

  Up at Piccadilly oh!

      All the way to Bristol oh!
  He drives her four-in-hand.

CXXXVIII.

    [The first line of this nursery rhyme is quoted in Beaumont
    and Fletcher's _Bonduca_, Act v, sc. 2. It is probable also
    that Sir Toby alludes to this song in _Twelfth Night_, Act
    ii, sc. 2, when he says, "Come on; there is sixpence for you;
    let's have a song." In _Epulario, or the Italian banquet_,
    1589, is a receipt "to make pies so that the birds may be
    alive in them and flie out when it is cut up," a mere device,
    live birds being introduced after the pie is made. This may be
    the original subject of the following song.]

  Sing a song of sixpence,
    A bag full of rye;
  Four and twenty blackbirds
    Baked in a pie;

  When the pie was open'd,
    The birds began to sing;
  Was not that a dainty dish,
    To set before the king?

  The king was in his counting-house
    Counting out his money;
  The queen was in the parlour
    Eating bread and honey;

  The maid was in the garden
    Hanging out the clothes,
  There came a little blackbird,
    And snapt off her nose.

  Jenny was so mad,
    She didn't know what to do;
  She put her finger in her ear,
    And crackt it right in two.


CXXXIX.

  Lend me thy mare to ride a mile?
  She is lamed, leaping over a stile.
  Alack! and I must keep the fair!
  I'll give thee money for thy mare.
  Oh, oh! say you so?
  Money will make the mare to go!

  About the bush, Willy,

    And buy a new coat.

  Five and five shillings,
    Five and a crown;
  Five and five shillings,
    Will buy a new gown.

  Five and five shillings,
    Five and a groat;
  Five and five shillings,
    Will buy a new coat.


CXLI.

  A pretty little girl in a round-eared cap
  I met in the streets t'other day;
      She gave me such a thump,
      That my heart it went bump;
  I thought I should have fainted away!
  I thought I should have fainted away!


CXLII.

  My father he died, but I can't tell you how,
  He left me six horses to drive in my plough:
        With my wing wang waddle oh,
        Jack sing saddle oh,
        Blowsey boys bubble oh,
        Under the broom.

  I sold my six horses and I bought me a cow;
  I'd fain have made a fortune but did not know how:
      With my, &c.

  I sold my cow, and I bought me a calf;
  I'd fain have made a fortune, but lost the best half:
      With my, &c.

  I sold my calf, and I bought me a cat;
  A pretty thing she was, in my chimney corner sat:
      With my, &c.

  I sold my cat, and bought me a mouse;
  He carried fire in his tail, and burnt down my house:
      With my, &c.


CXLIII.

  Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,
    And can't tell where to find them;
  Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
    And bring their tails behind them.

  Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
    And dreamt she heard them bleating;
  But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
    For they still were all fleeting.

  Then up she took her little crook,
    Determin'd for to find them;
  She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
    For they'd left all their tails behind 'em.


CXLIV.

  Jeanie come tie my,

  Jeanie come tie my bonnie cravat;
  I've tied it behind,

  And I've tied it so often, I'll tie it no more.


CXLV.

  Trip upon trenchers, and dance upon dishes,
  My mother sent me for some barm, some barm;
  She bid me tread lightly, and come again quickly,
  For fear the young men should do me some harm.
    Yet didn't you see, yet didn't you see,
    What naughty tricks they put upon me:

    They broke my pitcher,
      And spilt the water,
    And huff'd my mother,
      And chid her daughter,
  And kiss'd my sister instead of me.


CXLVI.

    [From 'Histrio-mastix, or, the Player Whipt,' 4to, Lond. 1610.
    Mr. Rimbault tells me this is common in Yorkshire.]

      Some up, and some down,
      There's players in the town,
  You wot well who they be;
      The sun doth arise,
      To three companies,
  One, two, three, four, make wee!

      Besides we that travel,
      With pumps full of gravel,
  Made all of such running leather:
      That once in a week,
      New masters we seek,
  And never can hold together.


CXLVII.

  Johnny shall have a new bonnet,
    And Johnny shall go to the fair,
  And Johnny shall have a blue ribbon
    To tie up his bonny brown hair.
  And why may not I love Johnny?
    And why may not Johnny love me?
  And why may not I love Johnny
    As well as another body?
  And here's a leg for a stocking,
    And here is a leg for a shoe,
  And he has a kiss for his daddy,
    And two for his mammy, I trow.
  And why may not I love Johnny?
    And why may not Johnny love me?
  And why may not I love Johnny,
    As well as another body?


CXLVIII.

  As I was walking o'er little Moorfields,
  I saw St. Paul's a running on wheels,
                  With a fee, fo, fum.
  Then for further frolics I'll go to France.
  While Jack shall sing and his wife shall dance,
                  With a fee, fo fum.


CXLIX.

    The north wind doth blow,
    And we shall have snow,
  And what will poor Robin do then?
                      Poor thing!

    He'll sit in a barn,
    And to keep himself warm,
  Will hide his head under his wing.
                      Poor thing!


CL.

    [From W. Wager's play, called 'The longer thou livest, the
    more foole thou art,' 4to, Lond.]

  The white dove sat on the castle wall,
  I bend my bow and shoot her I shall;
  I put her in my glove both feathers and all;
  I laid my bridle upon the shelf,
  If you will any more, sing it yourself.

  Elsie Marley is grown so fine,
  She won't get up to serve the swine,
  But lies in bed till eight or nine,
  And surely she does take her time.

  And do you ken Elsie Marley, honey?
  The wife who sells the barley, honey;
  She won't get up to serve her swine,
  And do you ken Elsie Marley, honey?

    [Elsie Marley is said to have been a merry alewife who lived
    near Chester, and the remainder of this song relating to her
    will be found in the 'Chester Garland,' 12mo, n.d. The first
    four lines have become favourites in the nursery.]


CLII.

  London bridge is broken down,
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  London bridge is broken down,
    With a gay lady.

  How shall we build it up again?
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  How shall we build it up again?
    With a gay lady.

  Silver and gold will be stole away,
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  Silver and gold will be stole away,
    With a gay lady.

  Build it up again with iron and steel,
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  Build it up with iron and steel,
    With a gay lady.

  Iron and steel will bend and bow,
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  Iron and steel will bend and bow,
    With a gay lady.

  Build it up with wood and clay,
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  Build it up with wood and clay,

  Wood and clay will wash away,
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  Wood and clay will wash away,

  Build it up with stone so strong,
    Dance o'er my lady lee;
  Huzza! 'twill last for ages long,

CLIII.

  Old Father of the Pye,
  I cannot sing, my lips are dry;
  But when my lips are very well wet,
  Then I can sing with the Heigh go Bet!

    [This appears to be an old hunting song. _Go bet_ is a very
    ancient sporting phrase, equivalent to _go along_. It occurs
    in Chaucer, Leg. Dido, 288.]


CLIV.

    [Part of this is in a song called 'Jockey's Lamentation,' in
    the 'Pills to Purge Melancholy,' 1719, vol. v, p. 317.]

  Tom he was a piper's son,
  He learn'd to play when he was young,
  But all the tunes that he could play,
  Was, "Over the hills and far away;"
  Over the hills, and a great way off,
  And the wind will blow my top-knot off.

  Now Tom with his pipe made such a noise,
  That he pleas'd both the girls and boys,
  And they stopp'd to hear him play,
  "Over the hills and far away."

  Tom with his pipe did play with such skill,
  That those who heard him could never keep still;
  Whenever they heard they began for to dance,
  Even pigs on their hind legs would after him prance.

  As Dolly was milking her cow one day,
  Tom took out his pipe and began for to play;
  So Doll and the cow danced "the Cheshire round,"
  Till the pail was broke, and the milk ran on the ground.

  He met old dame Trot with a basket of eggs,
  He used his pipe, and she used her legs;
  She danced about till the eggs were all broke,
  She began for to fret, but he laughed at the joke.

  He saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,
  Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;
  He took out his pipe and played them a tune,
  And the jackass's load was lightened full soon.

  Jacky, come give me thy fiddle,
    If ever thou mean to thrive:
  Nay; I'll not give my fiddle
    To any man alive.

  If I should give my fiddle,
    They'll think that I'm gone mad;
  For many a joyful day
    My fiddle and I have had.

    [The following lines are part of an old song, the whole of
    which may be found in 'Deuteromelia,' 1609, and also in MS.
    Additional, 5336, fol. 5.]

  Of all the gay birds that e'er I did see,
  The owl is the fairest by far to me;
  For all the day long she sits on a tree,
  And when the night comes away flies she.


CLVII.

  I love sixpence, pretty little sixpence,
    I love sixpence better than my life;
  I spent a penny of it, I spent another,
    And took fourpence home to my wife.

  Oh, my little fourpence, pretty little fourpence,
    I love fourpence better than my life;
  I spent a penny of it, I spent another,
    And I took twopence home to my wife.

  Oh, my little twopence, my pretty little twopence,
    I love twopence better than my life;
  I spent a penny of it, I spent another,
    And I took nothing home to my wife.

  Oh, my little nothing, my pretty little nothing,
    What will nothing buy for my wife?
  I have nothing, I spend nothing,
    I love nothing better than my wife.


CLVIII.

  Merry are the bells, and merry would they ring,
  Merry was myself, and merry could I sing;
  With a merry ding-dong, happy, gay, and free,
  And a merry sing-song, happy let us be!

  Waddle goes your gait, and hollow are your hose,
  Noddle goes your pate, and purple is your nose;
  Merry is your sing-song, happy, gay, and free,
  With a merry ding-dong, happy let us be!

  Merry have we met, and merry have we been,
  Merry let us part, and merry meet again;
  With our merry sing-song, happy, gay, and free,
  And a merry ding-dong, happy let us be!

  Open the gates and let her through,

  She lay eggs for gentlemen,
      But none for Wooley Foster!

    [The following catch is found in Ben Jonson's 'Masque of
    Oberon,' and is a most common nursery song at the present
    day.]

  Buz, quoth the blue fly,
    Hum, quoth the bee,
  Buz and hum they cry,
    And so do we:
  In his ear, in his nose,
    Thus, do you see?
  He ate the dormouse,
    Else it was he.


CLXIII.

  As I was going up the hill,
    I met with Jack the piper,
  And all the tunes that he could play
    Was "Tie up your petticoats tighter."

  I tied them once, I tied them twice,
    I tied them three times over;
  And all the songs that he could sing
    Was "Carry me safe to Dover."


CLXIV.

  There were two birds sat on a stone,

  And so the poor stone was left all alone,
    Fa, la, la, la, lal, de!

  I jump mejerrime jee!
    I care for nobody--no! not I,
  Since nobody cares for me.


CLXVII.

  As I was going along, long, long,
  A singing a comical song, song, song,
  The lane that I went was so long, long, long,
  And the song that I sung was as long, long, long,
  And so I went singing along.


CLXVIII.

  Where are you going, my pretty maid?
  I'm going a-milking, sir, she said.
  May I go with you, my pretty maid?

  My father's a farmer, sir, she said.

  Say, will you marry me, my pretty maid?
  Yes, if you please, kind sir, she said.

  I harrowed it with a bramble bush,
    Sing ivy, sing ivy;
  And reaped it with my little penknife,

  Quoth she, answer I'll give you none,
  Until my uncle Rat come home,

  Off the king's kitchen-door!


CLXXXVI.

    [A pen.]

  When I was taken from the fair body,
    They then cut off my head,

  But nothing can I do,
    Without my guider's will.

    of the riddle to belong to the seventeenth century. The answer

    practised by children.]

  If you love me, pop and fly;
  If you hate me, lay and die.


CCXXXIX.

    [The following, with a very slight variation, is found in Ben
    Jonson's 'Masque of Queen's,' and it is singular to account
    for its introduction into the modern nursery.]

  I went to the toad that lies under the wall,
  I charmed him out, and he came at my call;
  I scratch'd out the eyes of the owl before,
  I tore the bat's wing, what would you have more.


CCXL.

    [A charm somewhat similar to the following may be seen in the
    'Townley Mysteries,' p. 91. See a paper in the 'Archæologia,'
    vol. xxvii, p. 253, by the Rev. Lancelot Sharpe, M.A. See also
    MS. Lansd. 231, fol. 114, and Ady's 'Candle in the Dark,' 4to,
    London, 1650, p. 58.]

  Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

  And two to bear my soul away!


CCXLI.

    [Ady, in his 'Candle in the Dark,' 4to, Lond. 1656, p. 59,
    says that this was a charm to make butter come from the churn.
    It was to be said thrice.]

  Come, butter, come,
  Come, butter, come!
  Peter stands at the gate,
  Waiting for a butter'd cake;
  Come, butter, come!


CCXLII.

    [From Dr. Wallis's "Grammatica Linguæ Anglicanæ," 12mo, Oxon.
    1674, p. 164. This and the nine following are said to be
    certain cures for the hiccup if repeated in one breath.]

  When a Twister a twisting, will twist him a twist;
  For the twisting of his twist, he three times doth intwist;
  But if one of the twines of the twist do untwist,
  The twine that untwisteth, untwisteth the twist.

  Untwirling the twine that untwisteth between,
  He twirls, with the twister, the two in a twine:
  Then twice having twisted the twines of the twine
  He twisteth the twine he had twined in twain.

  The twain that, in twining, before in the twine,
  As twines were intwisted; he now doth untwine:
  'Twixt the twain inter-twisting a twine more between,
  He, twirling his twister, makes a twist of the twine.


CCXLIII.

  A Thatcher of Thatchwood went to Thatchet a thatching;
  Did a thatcher of Thatchwood go to Thatchet a thatching?
  If a thatcher of Thatchwood went to Thatchet a thatching,
  Where's the thatching the thatcher of Thatchwood has thatch'd?


CCXLIV.

    [Sometimes 'off a pewter plate' is added at the end of each
    line.]

  Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper;
  A peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked;
  If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper,
  Where's the peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked?


CCXLV.

  My father he left me, just as he was able,
  One bowl, one bottle, one lable,
  Two bowls, two bottles, two lables,
  Three, &c. [_And so on ad. lib. in one breath._]


CCXLVI.

  Robert Rowley rolled a round roll round,
  A round roll Robert Rowley rolled round;
  Where rolled the round roll Robert Rowley rolled round?


CCXLVII.

My grandmother sent me a new-fashioned three cornered cambric country
cut handkerchief. Not an old-fashioned three cornered cambric country
cut handkerchief, but a new-fashioned three cornered cambric country
cut handkerchief.


CCXLVIII.

Three crooked cripples went through Cripplegate, and through
Cripplegate went three crooked cripples.


CCXLIX.

  Swan swam over the sea--
    Swim, swan, swim;
  Swan swam back again,
    Well swam swan,


CCL.

  Hickup, hickup, go away!
  Come again another day;

  Rise up, right up!
  Three drops in the cup
  Are good for the hiccup.

CCLII.

  There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,
  She went to market her eggs for to sell;
  She went to market all on a market-day,
  And she fell asleep on the king's highway.

  There came by a pedlar whose name was Stout,
  He cut her petticoats all round about;
  He cut her petticoats up to the knees,
  Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.

  When this little woman first did wake,
  She began to shiver and she began to shake,
  She began to wonder and she began to cry,
  "Oh! deary, deary me, this is none of I!

  "But if it be I, as I do hope it be,
  I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;
  If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,
  And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail."

  Home went the little woman all in the dark,
  Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;
  He began to bark, so she began to cry,
  "Oh! deary, deary me, this is none of I!"


CCLIII.

  There was an old woman sat spinning,

  And that's all.


CCLVI.

  There was an old woman, her name it was Peg;

  You may follow her by the smell.

  And then she may swagger in two.


CCLXV.

  Old mother Hubbard
  Went to the cupboard,
    To get her poor dog a bone;
  But when she came there

    The dog made a bow;
  The dame said, your servant,
    The dog said, bow, wow.

    [Footnote *: Probably _loffing_ or _loffin'_, to complete the
    rhyme. So in Shakspeare's 'Mids. Night's Dream,' act ii, sc. 1:

      "And then the whole quire hold their hips, and _loffe_."]


CCLXVI.

    [The first two lines of the following are the same with those

    13.]

  There was an old woman
    Lived under a hill,
  She put a mouse in a bag,

    Of a mouse in his life.


CCLXVII.

    [The following is part of a comic song called 'Success to

  Jerry, and James, and John:

  John was lost and never was found,

  Jerry, and James, and John!


CCLXVIII.

    [The tale on which the following story is founded is found
    in a MS. of the fifteenth century, preserved in the Chetham
    Library at Manchester.]

  There was an old man, who lived in a wood,
    As you may plainly see;
  He said he could do as much work in a day,
    As his wife could do in three.
  With all my heart, the old woman said,
    If that you will allow,
  To-morrow you'll stay at home in my stead,
    And I'll go drive the plough:

  But you must milk the Tidy cow,
    For fear that she go dry;
  And you must feed the little pigs
    That are within the sty;
  And you must mind the speckled hen,
    For fear she lay away;
  And you must reel the spool of yarn
    That I spun yesterday.

  The old woman took a staff in her hand,
    And went to drive the plough:
  The old man took a pail in his hand,
    And went to milk the cow;
  But Tidy hinched, and Tidy flinched,
    And Tidy broke his nose,
  And Tidy gave him such a blow,
    That the blood ran down to his toes.

  High! Tidy! ho! Tidy! high!
    Tidy! do stand still;
  If ever I milk you, Tidy, again,
    'Twill be sore against my will!
  He went to feed the little pigs,
    That were within the sty;
  He hit his head against the beam,
    And he made the blood to fly.

  He went to mind the speckled hen,
    For fear she'd lay astray,
  And he forgot the spool of yarn
    His wife spun yesterday.

  So he swore by the sun, the moon, and the stars,
    And the green leaves on the tree,
  If his wife didn't do a day's work in her life,
    She should ne'er be ruled by he.


CCLXIX.

  There was an old man of Tobago,
  Who lived on rice, gruel, and sago;

    And that's half;
  He took him out of the stall,
  And put him on the wall;
    And that's all.


CCLXXII.

  Father Short came down the lane,
    Oh! I'm obliged to hammer and smite
    From four in the morning till eight at night,
  For a bad master, and a worse dame.


CCLXXIII.

  There was an old woman called Nothing-at-all,
  Who rejoiced in a dwelling exceedingly small:
  A man stretched his mouth to its utmost extent,
  And down at one gulp house and old woman went.


CCLXXIV.

  There was an old woman of Norwich,
  Who lived upon nothing but porridge;
    Parading the town,
    She turned cloak into gown,
  This thrifty old woman of Norwich.


CCLXXV.

  A little old man of Derby,
  How do you think he served me?
  He took away my bread and cheese,
  And that is how he served me.


CCLXXVI.

  There was an old woman in Surrey,
  Who, was morn, noon, and night in a hurry;
      Call'd her husband a fool,
      Drove the children to school,
  The worrying old woman of Surrey.

TENTH CLASS--GAMES.


CCLXXVII.

    [Rhymes used by children to decide who is to begin a game.]

  One-ery, two-ery,
    Ziccary zan;
  Hollow bone, crack a bone,
    Ninery, ten:
  Spittery spot,
    It must be done;
  Twiddleum twaddleum,
    Twenty-one.

  Hink spink, the puddings stink,
    The fat begins to fry,
  Nobody at home, but jumping Joan,
    Father, mother, and I.
  Stick, stock, stone dead,
    Blind man can't see,
  Every knave will have a slave,
    You or I must be he.


CCLXXVIII.

    [A game of the Fox. In a children's game, where all the little
    actors are seated in a circle, the following stanza is used as
    question and answer.]

  Who goes round my house this night?
    None but cruel Tom!
  Who steals all the sheep at night?
    None but this poor one.


CCLXXIX.

  Dance, Thumbkin, dance,
        [_Keep the thumb in motion._
  Dance, ye merrymen, every one:
        [_All the fingers in motion._
  For Thumbkin, he can dance alone,
        [_The thumb only moving_.
  Thumbkin, he can dance alone,
        [_Ditto._
  Dance, Foreman, dance,
        [_The first finger moving._
  Dance, ye merrymen, every one;
        [_The whole moving._
  But Foreman, he can dance alone,
  Foreman, he can dance alone.

    [and So on With the Others--naming the 2d Finger Longman--the
    3d Finger Ringman--and the 4th Finger Littleman. Littleman
    Cannot Dance Alone.]


CCLXXX.

    [The following is used by schoolboys, when two are starting to
    run a race.]

  One to make ready,
    And two to prepare;
  Good luck to the rider,
    And away goes the mare.


CCLXXXI.

    [At the conclusion, the captive is privately asked if he will
    have oranges or lemons (the two leaders of the arch having
    previously agreed which designation shall belong to each),
    and he goes behind the one he may chance to name. When all
    are thus divided into two parties, they conclude the game by
    trying to pull each other beyond a certain line.]

  Gay go up and gay go down,
  To ring the bells of London town.

  Bull's eyes and targets,
  Say the bells of St. Marg'ret's.

  Brickbats and tiles,
  Say the bells of St. Giles'.

  Halfpence and farthings,
  Say the bells of St. Martin's.

  Oranges and lemons,
  Say the bells of St. Clement's.

  Pancakes and fritters,
  Say the bells of St. Peter's.

  Two sticks and an apple,
  Say the bells at Whitechapel.

  Old Father Baldpate,
  Say the slow bells at Aldgate.

  You owe me ten shillings,
  Say the bells at St. Helen's.

  Pokers and tongs,
  Say the bells at St. John's.

  Kettles and pans,
  Say the bells at St. Ann's.

  When will you pay me?
  Say the bells at Old Bailey.

  When I grow rich,
  Say the bells at Shoreditch.

  Pray when will that be?
  Say the bells of Stepney.

  I am sure I don't know,
  Says the great bell at Bow.

  Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
  And here comes a chopper to chop off your head.


CCLXXXII.

    [One child holds a wand to the face of another, repeating
    these lines, and making grimaces, to cause the latter
    to laugh, and so to the others; those who laugh paying a
    forfeit.]

  Buff says Buff to all his men,
  And I say Buff to you again;
  Buff neither laughs nor smiles,
  But carries his face
  With a very good grace,
  And passes the stick to the very next place!


CCLXXXIII.

    [Game with the hands.]

  Pease-pudding hot,
    Pease-pudding cold,
  Pease-pudding in the pot,
    Nine days old.
  Some like it hot,
    Some like it cold,
  Some like it in the pot,
    Nine days old.


CCLXXXIV.

  Awake, arise, pull out your eyes,
    And hear what time of day;
  And when you have done, pull out your tongue,
    And see what you can say.


CCLXXXV.

GAME OF THE GIPSY.

    [One child is selected for Gipsy, one for Mother, and one for
    Daughter Sue. The Mother says,--

  I charge my daughters every one
  To keep good house while I am gone.
  You and _you_ (_points_) but specially _you_,
  [_Or sometimes_, but specially _Sue_.]
  Or else I'll beat you black and blue.

    During the Mother's absence, the Gipsy comes in, entices a
    child away, and hides her. This process is repeated till all
    the children are hidden, when the Mother has to find them.]


CCLXXXVI.

    [This game begins thus: Take this--What's this?--A gaping,
    wide-mouthed, waddling frog, &c.]

  Twelve huntsmen with horns and hounds,
  Hunting over other men's grounds!
  Eleven ships sailing o'er the main,
  Some bound for France and some for Spain:
  I wish them all safe home again:
  Ten comets in the sky,
  Some low and some high;
  Nine peacocks in the air,
  I wonder how they all came there,
  I do not know and I do not care;
  Eight joiners in joiner's hall,
  Working with the tools and all;
  Seven lobsters in a dish,
  As fresh as any heart could wish;
  Six beetles against the wall,
  Close by an old woman's apple stall;
  Five puppies of our dog Ball,
  Who daily for their breakfast call;
  Four horses stuck in a bog,
  Three monkeys tied to a clog;
  Two pudding-ends would choke a dog.
  With a gaping, wide-mouthed, waddling frog.


CCLXXXVII.

    [A string of children, hand in hand, stand in a row. A child
    (A) stands in front of them, as leader; two other children
    (B and C) form an arch, each holding both the hands of the
    other.]

  A.  Draw a pail of water,
      For my lady's daughter;
      My father's a king, and my mother's a queen,
      My two little sisters are dress'd in green,
      Stamping grass and parsley,
      Marigold leaves and daisies.
  B.  One rush, two rush,
      Pray thee, fine lady, come under my bush.

    [A passes by under the arch, followed by the whole string of
    children, the last of whom is taken captive by B and C. The
    verses are repeated, until all are taken.]


CCLXXXVIII.

    [The following seems to belong to the last game; but it is
    usually found by itself in the small books of children's
    rhymes.]

  Sieve my lady's oatmeal,
    Grind my lady's flour,
  Put it in a chesnut,
    Let it stand an hour;
  One may rush, two may rush,
  Come, my girls, walk under the bush.


CCLXXXIX.

  Queen Anne, queen Anne, you sit in the sun,
  As fair as a lily, as white as a wand.
  I send you three letters, and pray read one,
  You must read one, if you can't read all,
  So pray, Miss or Master, throw up the ball.


CCXC.

  There were three jovial Welshmen,
    As I have heard them say,
  And they would go a-hunting
    Upon St. David's day.

  All the day they hunted,
    And nothing could they find
  But a ship a-sailing,
    A-sailing with the wind.

  One said it was a ship,
    The other he said, nay;
  The third said it was a house,
    With the chimney blown away.

  And all the night they hunted,
    And nothing could they find
  But the moon a-gliding,
    A-gliding with the wind.

  One said it was the moon,
    The other he said, nay;
  The third said it was a cheese,
    And half o't cut away.

  And all the day they hunted,
    And nothing could they find
  But a hedgehog in a bramble bush,
    And that they left behind.

  The first said it was a hedgehog,
    The second he said, nay;
  The third it was a pincushion,
    And the pins stuck in wrong way.

  And all the night they hunted,
    And nothing could they find
  But a hare in a turnip field,
    And that they left behind.

  The first said it was a hare,
    The second he said, nay;
  The third said it was a calf,
    And the cow had run away.

  And all the day they hunted,
    And nothing could they find
  But an owl in a holly tree,
    And that they left behind.

  One said it was an owl,
    The other he said, nay;
  The third said 'twas an old man,
    And his beard growing grey.


CCXCI.

  Is John Smith within?--
  Yes, that he is.
  Can he set a shoe?--
  Ay, marry, two,
  Here a nail, there a nail,
  Tick, tack, too.


CCXCII.

  Margery Mutton-pie, and Johnny Bopeep,
  They met together in Grace-church Street;
  In and out, in and out, over the way,
  Oh! says Johnny, 'tis chop-nose day.


CCXCIII.

  Intery, mintery, cutery-corn,
  Apple seed and apple thorn;
  Wine, brier, limber-lock,
  Five geese in a flock,
  Sit and sing by a spring,
  O-U-T, and in again.


CCXCIV.

    [The game of water-skimming is of high antiquity, being
    mentioned by Julius Pollux, and also by Eustathius, in his
    commentary upon Homer. Brand quotes a curious passage from
    Minucius Felix; but all antiquaries seem to have overlooked
    the very curious notice in Higgins' adaptation of Junius's
    'Nomenclator,' 8vo, London, 1585, p. 299, where it is called
    "a duck and a drake, and a halfe-penie cake." Thus it is
    probable that lines like the following were employed in this
    game as early as 1585; and it may be that the last line has
    recently furnished a hint to Mathews in his amusing song in
    'Patter _v_. Clatter.']

      A duck and a drake,
      A nice barley-cake,
  With a penny to pay the old baker;
      A hop and a scotch,
      Is another notch,
  Slitherum, slatherum, take her.


CCXCV.

  See, Saw, Margery Daw,
  Sold her bed and lay upon straw;
  Was not she a dirty slut,
  To sell her bed and lie in the dirt!


CCXCVI.

  See, saw, Margery Daw,
    Little Jackey shall have a new master;
  Little Jackey shall have but a penny a day,
    Because he can't work any faster.


CCXCVII.

  1. I am a gold lock.
  2. I am a gold key.
  1. I am a silver lock.
  2. I am a silver key.
  1. I am a brass lock.
  2. I am a brass key.
  1. I am a lead lock.
  2. I am a lead key.
  1. I am a monk lock.
  2. I am a monk key!


CCXCVIII.

  Ride a cock-horse to Banbury-cross,
  To buy little Johnny a galloping-horse;
  It trots behind, and it ambles before,
  And Johnny shall ride till he can ride no more.


CCXCIX.

  Ride a cock-horse to Banbury-cross,
    To see what Tommy can buy;
  A penny white loaf, a penny white cake,
    And a twopenny apple-pie.


CCC.

  Jack be nimble,
    And Jack be quick:
  And Jack jump over
    The candle-stick.


CCCI.

    [This should be accompanied by a kind of pantomimic dance, in
    which the motions of the body and arms express the process of
    weaving; the motion of the shuttle, &c.]

  Weave the diaper tick-a-tick tick,
  Weave the diaper tick--
  Come this way, come that
  As close as a mat,
  Athwart and across, up and down, round about,
  And forwards, and backwards, and inside, and out;
  Weave the diaper thick-a-thick thick,
  Weave the diaper thick!


CCCII.

    [Used in Somersetshire in counting out the game of pee-wip or
    pee wit.]

  One-ery, two-ery, hickary, hum,
  Fillison, follison, Nicholson, John,
  Quever, quauver, Irish Mary,
  Stenkarum, stankarum, buck!


CCCIII.

  Whoop, whoop, and hollow,
  Good dogs won't follow,
  Without the hare cries "pee wit."


CCCIV.

  Tom Brown's two little Indian boys,
    One ran away,
    The other wouldn't stay,--
  Tom Brown's two little Indian boys.


CCCV.

  There were two blackbirds,
      Sitting on a hill,
  The one nam'd Jack,
      The other nam'd Jill;
    Fly away Jack!
    Fly away Jill!
    Come again Jack!
    Come again Jill!


CCCVI.

  Tip, top, tower,
  Tumble down in an hour.


CCCVII.

  1. I went up one pair of stairs.
  2. Just like me.
  1. I went up two pair of stairs.
  2. Just like me.
  1. I went into a room.
  2. Just like me.
  1. I looked out of a window.
  2. Just like me.
  1. And there I saw a monkey.
  2. Just like me.


CCCVIII.

  Number number nine, this hoop's mine;
  Number number ten, take it back again.


CCCIX.

    Here goes my lord
  A trot, a trot, a trot, a trot,
    Here goes my lady
  A canter, a canter, a canter, a canter!
      Here goes my young master
    Jockey-hitch, Jockey-hitch, Jockey-hitch, Jockey-hitch:
      Here goes my young miss,
    An amble, an amble, an amble, an amble!
  The footman lays behind to tipple ale and wine,
  And goes gallop, a gallop, a gallop, to make up his time.


CCCX.

    [This is acted by two or more girls, who walk or dance up
    and down, turning, when they say, "turn, cheeses, turn." The
    "green cheeses," as I am informed, are made with sage and
    potatoe-tops. Two girls are said to be "cheese and cheese."]

  Green cheese, yellow laces,
  Up and down the market-places,
    Turn, cheeses, turn!


CCCXI.

  To market ride the gentlemen,
    So do we, so do we;
  Then comes the country clown,
    Hobbledy gee, Hobbledy gee;
  First go the ladies, nim, nim, nim;
  Next come the gentlemen, trim, trim, trim;
  Then comes the country clowns, gallop-a-trot.


CCCXII.

  Ride a cock-horse to Coventry-cross;
  To see what Emma can buy;
  A penny white cake I'll buy for her sake,
  And a twopenny tart or a pie.


CCCXIII.

  Ride a cock-horse to Banbury-cross,
  To see an old lady upon a white horse,
  Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes,
  And so she makes music wherever she goes.


CCCXIV.

    [Song set to five toes.]

  1. Let us go to the wood, says this pig;
  2. What to do there? says that pig;
  3. To look for my mother, says this pig;
  4. What to do with her? says that pig;
  5. Kiss her to death, says this pig.


CCCXV.

    [A number of boys and girls stand round one in the middle, who
    repeats the following lines, counting the children until one
    is counted out by the end of the verses.]

  Ring me (1), ring me (2), ring me rary (3),
  As I go round (4), ring by ring (5),
  A virgin (6) goes a maying (7),
  Here's a flower (8), and there's a flower (9),
  Growing in my lady's garden (10),
  If you set your foot awry (11),
  Gentle John will make you cry (12),
  If you set your foot amiss (13),
  Gentle John (14) will give you a kiss.

    [The child upon whom (14) falls is then taken out, and
    forced to select one of the other sex. The middle child then
    proceeds.]

  This [lady or gentleman] is none of ours,
  Has put [him or her] self in [the selected child's] power,
  So clap all hands, and ring all bells, and make the wedding o'er.

    [_All clap hands._]

    [If the child taken by lot joins in the clapping, the selected
    child is rejected, and I believe takes the middle place.
    Otherwise, I think, there is a salute.]


CCCXVI.

    [Another game, played exclusively by boys. Two, who are fixed
    upon for the purpose, leave the group, and privately arrange
    that the pass-word shall be some implement of a particular
    trade. The trade is announced in the dialogue, and then the
    fun is, that the unfortunate wight who guesses the "tool" is
    beaten with the caps of his fellows till he reaches a fixed
    goal, after which he goes out in turn.]

  "Two broken tradesmen,
    Newly come over,
  The one from France and Scotland,
    The other from Dover."
  "What's your trade?"

    [Carpenters, nailors, smiths, tinkers, or any other is
    answered, and on guessing the instrument "plane him, hammer
    him, rasp him, or solder him," is called out respectively
    during the period of punishment.]


CCCXVII.

  Clap hands, clap hands,
    Hie Tommy Randy,
  Did you see my good man?
    They call him Cock-a-bandy.

  Silken Stockings on his legs,
    Silver buckles glancin',
  A sky-blue bonnet on his head,
    And oh, but he is handsome.


CCCXVIII.

    [A song set to five fingers.]

  1. This pig went to market;
  2. This pig staid at home;
  3. This pig had a bit of meat;
  4. And this pig had none;
  5. This pig said, Wee, wee, wee! I can't find my way home.


CCCXIX.

    [Children hunting bats.]

  Bat, bat, (_clap hands_,)
  Come under my hat,
    And I'll give you a slice of bacon;
  And when I bake,
  I'll give you a cake,
    If I am not mistaken.


CCCXX.

    [A game at ball.]

  Cuckoo, cherry tree,
  Catch a bird, and give it to me;
  Let the tree be high or low,
  Let it hail, rain, or snow.


CCCXXI.

    [Two of the strongest children are selected, A and B; A stands
    within a ring of the children, B being outside.]

  A. Who is going round my sheepfold?
  B. Only poor old Jacky Lingo.
  A. Don't steal any of my black sheep.
  B. No, no more I will, only by one,
  Up, says Jacky Lingo. (_Strikes one._)

    [The child struck leaves the ring, and takes hold of B behind;
    B in the same manner takes the other children, one by one,
    gradually increasing his tail on each repetition of the
    verses, until he has got the whole; A then tries to get them
    back; B runs away with them; they try to shelter themselves
    behind B; A drags them off, one by one, setting them against
    a wall, until he has recovered all. A regular tearing game, as
    children say.]


CCCXXII.

            Highty cock O!
            To London we go,
            To York we ride;
  And Edward has pussy-cat tied to his side;
  He shall have little dog tied to the other,
  And then he goes trid trod to see his grandmother.


CCCXXIII.

  This is the key of the kingdom.
  In that kingdom there is a city.
  In that city there is a town.
  In that town there is a street.
  In that street there is a lane.
  In that lane there is a yard.
  In that yard there is a house.
  In that house there is a room.
  In that room there is a bed.
  On that bed there is a basket.
  In that basket there are some flowers.
  Flowers in the basket, basket in the bed, bed in the room, &c. &c.


CCCXXIV.

    [Children stand round, and are counted one by one, by means
    of this rhyme. The child upon whom the last number falls is
    _out_, for "Hide or Seek," or any other game where a victim is
    required. A cock and bull story of this kind is related of the
    historian Josephus. There are other versions of this, and one
    may be seen in 'Blackwood's Magazine' for August, 1821, p.
    36.]

  Hickory (1), Dickory (2), Dock (3),
  The mouse ran up the clock (4),
  The clock struck one (5),
  The mouse was gone (6);
  O (7), U (8), T (9), spells OUT!


CCCXXV.

  One old Oxford ox opening oysters;
  Two tee-totums totally tired of trying to trot to Tadbury;
  Three tall tigers tippling tenpenny tea;
  Four fat friars fanning fainting flies;
  Five frippy Frenchmen foolishly fishing for flies;
  Six sportsmen shooting snipes;
  Seven Severn salmons swallowing shrimps;
  Eight Englishmen eagerly examining Europe;
  Nine nimble noblemen nibbling nonpareils;
  Ten tinkers tinkling upon ten tin tinderboxes with ten tenpenny
          tacks;
  Eleven elephants elegantly equipt;
  Twelve typographical topographers typically translating types.


CCCXXVI.

    [The following lines are sung by children when starting for a
    race.]

  Good horses, bad horses,
    What is the time of day?
  Three o'clock, four o'clock,
    Now fare you away.


CCCXXVII.

  See-saw, jack a daw,
  What is a craw to do wi' her?
  She has not a stocking to put on her,
  And the craw has not one for to gi' her.


CCCXXVIII.

    [The following is a game played as follows: A string of
    boys and girls, each holding by his predecessor's skirts,
    approaches two others, who with joined and elevated hands form
    a double arch. After the dialogue, the line passes through,
    and the last is caught by a sudden lowering of the arms--if
    possible.]

  How many miles is it to Babylon?--
  Threescore miles and ten.
  Can I get there by candle-light?--
  Yes, and back again!
  If your heels are nimble and light,
  You may get there by candle-light.


CCCXXIX.

  Clap hands, clap hands!
    Till father comes home;
  For father's got money,
    But mother's got none.
        Clap hands, &c.
          Till father, &c.


CCCXXX.

  See-saw sacradown,
  Which is the way to London town?
  One foot up, and the other down,
  And that is the way to London town.


CCCXXXI.

  Here stands a post,
  Who put it there?
  A better man than you;
  Touch it if you dare!


CCCXXXII.

    [A stands with a row of girls (her daughters) behind her; B, a
    suitor, advances.]

  B.  Trip trap over the grass: If you please will you let one of
            your [eldest] daughters come,
        Come and dance with me?
        I will give you pots and pans, I will give you brass,
        I will give you anything for a pretty lass.
  A.  says, "No."
  B.  I will give you gold and silver, I will give you pearl,
        I will give you anything for a pretty girl.
  A.  Take one, take one, the fairest you may see.
  B.  The fairest one that I can see
        Is pretty Nancy,--come to me.

    [B carries one off, and says:]

        You shall have a duck, my dear,
        And you shall have a drake,
        And you shall have a young man
            apprentice for your sake.

    [Children say:]

  If this young man should happen to die,
    And leave this poor woman a widow,
  The bells shall all ring, and the birds shall all sing,
    And we'll all clap hands together.

    [So it is repeated until the whole are taken.]


CCCXXXIII.

    [The "Three Knights of Spain" is a game played in nearly the
    same manner as the preceding. The _dramatis personæ_ form
    themselves in two parties, one representing a courtly dame
    and her daughters, the other the suitors of the daughters.
    The last party, moving backwards and forwards, with their arms
    entwined, approach and recede from the mother party, which
    is stationary, singing to a very sweet air. See Chambers'
    'Popular Rhymes,' p. 66.]


_Suitors._

  We are three brethren out of Spain,
  Come to court your daughter Jane.

_Mother._

  My daughter Jane she is too young,
  And has not learned her mother tongue.

_Suitors._

  Be she young, or be she old,
  For her beauty she must be sold.
  So fare you well, my lady gay,
  We'll call again another day.

_Mother._

  _Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,
  And rub thy spurs till they be bright._

_Suitors._

  Of my spurs take you no thought,
  For in this town they were not bought,
  So fare you well, my lady gay,
  We'll call again another day.

_Mother._

  _Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,
  And take the fairest in your sight._

_Suitor._

  The fairest maid that I can see,
  Is pretty Nancy,--come to me.

  Here comes your daughter safe and sound,
  Every pocket with a thousand pound;
  Every finger with a gay gold ring;
  Please to take your daughter in.

    [A game on the slate.]

  Eggs, butter, bread,
  Stick, stock, stone dead!
  Stick him up, stick him down,
  Stick him in the old man's crown!


CCCXXXV.

    [In the following childish amusement, one extends his arm, and
    the other in illustration of the narrative, strikes him gently
    with the side of his hand at the shoulder and wrist; and then
    at the word "middle," with considerable force, on the flexor
    muscles at the elbow-joint.]

  My father was a Frenchman,
    He bought for me a fiddle,
  He cut me here, he cut me here,
    He cut me right in the middle.


CCCXXXVI.

    [Patting the foot on the five toes.]

  Shoe the colt, shoe!
    Shoe the wild mare;
  Put a sack on her back,
    See if she'll bear.
  If she'll bear,
    We'll give her some grains;
  If she won't bear,
    We'll dash out her brains!

    [A play with the face. The child exclaims:]

  Ring the bell!       _giving a lock of its hair a pull._
  Knock at the door!   _tapping its forehead._
  Draw the latch!      _pulling up its nose._
  And walk in!         _opening its mouth and putting in its finger._

    [An exercise during which the fingers of the child are
    enumerated.]

  Thumbikin, Thumbikin, broke the barn,

  Carried it away.
  Old Mid-man sat and saw,
  But Peesy-weesy paid for a'.

CCCXLIII.

    [The two following are fragments of a game called "The Lady
    of the Land," a complete version of which has not fallen in my
    way.]

  Here comes a poor woman from baby-land,
  With three small children in her hand:
  One can brew, the other can bake,
  The other can make a pretty round cake.
  One can sit in the garden and spin,
  Another can make a fine bed for the king;
  Pray ma'am will you take one in?


CCCXLIV.

  I can make diet bread,
    Thick and thin;
  I can make diet bread,
    Fit for the king.


CCCXLV.

  Here we come a piping,
  First in spring, and then in May;
  The queen she sits upon the sand,
  Fair as a lily, white as a wand:
  King John has sent you letters three,
  And begs you'll read them unto me.--
  We can't read one without them all,
  So pray, Miss Bridget, deliver the ball!

    [Each child in succession repeats the gifts of the day, and
    forfeits for each mistake. This accumulative process is a
    favorite with children: in early writers, such as Homer, the
    repetition of messages, &c. pleases on the same principle.]

  There was a man, and his name was Dob,
  And he had a wife, and her name was Mob,
  And he had a dog, and he called it Cob,
  And she had a cat, called Chitterabob.

          Chitterabob, says Mob,
          Cob was Dob's dog,
          Chitterabob Mob's cat.


CCCLI.

    [Two children sit opposite to each other; the first turns her
    fingers one over the other, and says:]

  "May my geese fly over your barn?"

    [The other answers, Yes, if they'll do no harm. Upon which
    the first unpacks the fingers of her hand, and waving it over
    head, says:]

  "Fly over his barn and eat all his corn."

    [Children dance round first, then stop and shake the hand, &c.
    then turn slowly round, and then dance in a ring again.]


CCCLIII.

THE OLD DAME.

    [One child, called the Old Dame, sits on the floor, and the
    rest, joining hands, form a circle round her, and dancing,
    sing the following lines:]

  _Children._ To Beccles! to Beccles!
              To buy a bunch of nettles!
              Pray, old Dame, what's o'clock?

  _Dame._ One, going for two.

  _Children._ To Beccles! to Beccles!
              To buy a bunch of nettles!
              Pray, old Dame, what's o'clock?

  _Dame._ Two, going for three.

    [And so on till she reaches, "Eleven going for twelve." After
    this the following questions are asked, with the replies.--C.
    Where have you been? D. To the wood. C. What for? D. To pick
    up sticks. C. What for? D. To light my fire. C. What for?
    D. To boil my kettle. C. What for? D. To cook some of your
    chickens. The children then all run away as fast as they can,
    and the Old Dame tries to catch one of them. Whoever is caught
    is the next to personate the Dame.]


CCCLIV.

DROP-GLOVE.

    [Children stand round in a circle, leaving a space between
    each. One walks round the outside, and carries a glove in her
    hand, saying:]

  I've a glove in my hand,
                      Hittity Hot!
  Another in my other hand,
                      Hotter than that!
  So I sow beans, and so they come up,
  Some in a mug, and some in a cup.
  I sent a letter to my love,
  I lost it, I lost it!
  I found it, I found it!
  It burns, it scalds.

    [Repeating the last words very rapidly, till she drops the
    glove behind one of them, and whoever has the glove must
    overtake her, following her exactly in and out till she
    catches her. If the pursuer makes a mistake in the pursuit,
    she loses, and the game is over; otherwise she continues the
    game with the glove.]


CCCLV.

    [In the following, the various parts of the countenance are
    touched as the lines are repeated; and at the close the chin
    is struck playfully, that the tongue may be gently bitten.]

      How shall I get home to night?

  A.  Spin your legs, and run fast.

    [A Christmas custom in Lancashire. The boys dress themselves
    up with ribands, and perform various pantomimes, after which
    one of them, who has a blackened face, a rough skin coat, and
    a broom in his hand, sings as follows.]

  Here come I,
    Little David Doubt;
  If you don't give me money,
    I'll sweep you all out.
  Money I want,
    And money I crave;
  If you don't give me money,
    I'll sweep you all to the grave!


CCCLIX.

    [The following lines are said by the nurse when moving the
    child's foot up and down.]

  The dog of the kill,[*]
  He went to the mill
    To lick mill-dust:
  The miller he came
  With a stick on his back,--
    Home, dog, home!
  The foot behind,
    The foot before:
  When he came to a stile,
    Thus he jumped o'er.

    [Footnote *: That is, kiln.]


CCCLX.

    [The following lines are repeated by the nurse when sliding
    her hand down the child's face.]


  My mother and your mother
    Went over the way;
  Said my mother to your mother,
    It's chop-a-nose day!

    [The following is quoted in Parkin's reply to Dr. Stukeley's
    second number of 'Origines Roystonianæ,' 4to, London, 1748, p.
    vi.]

  Peter White will ne'er go right,
    Would you know the reason why?
  He follows his nose where'er he goes,
    And that stands all awry.


CCCLXII.

  O that I was where I would be,
  Then would I be where I am not!
  But where I am must be,
  And where I would be I cannot.


CCCLXIII.

    [The following was sung to the tune of Chevy Chase. It was
    taken from a poetical tale in the 'Choyce Poems,' 12mo,
    London, 1662, the music to which may be seen in D'Urfey's
    'Pills to Purge Melancholy,' 1719, vol. iv, p. 1.]

  Three children sliding on the ice
    Upon a summer's day,
  As it fell out, they all fell in,
    The rest they ran away.

  Now had these children been at home,
    Or sliding on dry ground,
  Ten thousand pounds to one penny,
    They had not all been drown'd.

  You parents all that children have,
    And you that have got none,
  If you would have them safe abroad,
    Pray keep them safe at home.


CCCLXIV.

  There was a man of Newington,
    And he was wond'rous wise,
  He jump'd into a quickset hedge,
    And scratch'd out both his eyes:
  But when he saw his eyes were out,
    With all his might and main,
  He jump'd into another hedge,
    And scratch'd 'em in again.


CCCLXV.

  Up stairs, down stairs, upon my lady's window,
  There I saw a cup of sack and a race of ginger;
  Apples at the fire, and nuts to crack,
  A little boy in the cream-pot up to his neck.


CCCLXVI.

  I would if I cou'd,
  If I cou'dn't, how cou'd I?
  I cou'dn't, without I cou'd, cou'd I?
  Cou'd you, without you cou'd, cou'd ye?
  Cou'd ye, cou'd ye?
  Cou'd you, without you cou'd, cou'd ye?


CCCLXVII.

  If all the world was apple-pie,
  And all the sea was ink,
  And all the trees were bread and cheese,
  What should we have for drink?


CCCLXVIII.

  Tobacco wick! tobacco wick!
  When you're well, 'twill make you sick:
  Tobacco wick! tobacco wick!
  'Twill make you well when you are sick.


CCCLXIX.

    [The following occurs in a MS. of the seventeenth century, in
    the Sloane Collection, the reference to which I have mislaid.]

  The man in the wilderness asked me,
  How many strawberries grew in the sea?
  I answered him, as I thought good,
  As many as red herrings grew in the wood.


CCCLXX.

    [The conclusion of the following resembles a verse in the
    nursery history of Mother Hubbard.]

  There was an old woman, and what do you think?
  She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink:
  Victuals and drink were the chief of her diet;
  This tiresome old woman could never be quiet.

  She went to the baker, to buy her some bread,
  And when she came home her old husband was dead;
  She went to the clerk to toll the bell,
  And when she came back her old husband was well.


CCCLXXI.

  Here am I, little jumping Joan;
  When nobody's with me,
  I'm always alone.


CCCLXXII.

There was an old woman had nothing,
  And there came thieves to rob her;
When she cried out she made no noise,
  But all the country heard her.


CCCLXXIII.

  There was a little Guinea-pig,
  Who, being little, was not big;
  He always walked upon his feet,
  And never fasted when he eat.

  When from a place he ran away,
  He never at that place did stay;
  And while he ran, as I am told,
  He ne'er stood still for young or old.

  He often squeak'd and sometimes vi'lent,
  And when he squeak'd he ne'er was silent;
  Though ne'er instructed by a cat,
  He knew a mouse was not a rat.

  One day, as I am certified,
  He took a whim and fairly died;
  And, as I'm told by men of sense,
  He never has been living since.


CCCLXXIV.

    [Mind your punctuation!]

  I saw a peacock with a fiery tail,
  I saw a blazing comet drop down hail,
  I saw a cloud wrapped with ivy round,
  I saw an oak creep upon the ground,
  I saw a pismire swallow up a whale,
  I saw the sea brimful of ale,
  I saw a Venice glass full fifteen feet deep,
  I saw a well full of men's tears that weep,
  I saw red eyes all of a flaming fire,
  I saw a house bigger than the moon and higher,
  I saw the sun at twelve o'clock at night,
  I saw the man that saw this wondrous sight.


CCCLXXV.

  My true love lives far from me,
      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.
  Many a rich present he sends to me,
      Petrum, Partrum, Paradise, Temporie,
      Perrie, Merrie, Dixie, Dominie.

  He sent me a goose, without a bone;
  He sent me a cherry, without a stone.
                        Petrum, &c.

  He sent me a Bible, no man could read;
  He sent me a blanket, without a thread.
                        Petrum, &c.

  How could there be a goose without a bone?
  How could there be a cherry without a stone?
                        Petrum, &c.

  How could there be a Bible no man could read?
  How could there be a blanket without a thread?
                        Petrum, &c.

  When the goose is in the egg-shell, there is no bone;
  When the cherry is in the blossom, there is no stone.
                        Petrum, &c.

  When ye Bible is in ye press no man it can read;
  When ye wool is on ye sheep's back, there is no thread.
                        Petrum, &c.


CCCLXXVI.

  There was a man and he was mad,
  And he jump'd into a pea-swad;[A]
  The pea-swad was over-full,
  So he jump'd into a roaring bull;
  The roaring bull was over-fat,
  So he jump'd into a gentleman's hat;
  The gentleman's hat was over-fine,
  So he jump'd into a bottle of wine;
  The bottle of wine was over-dear,
  So he jump'd into a bottle of beer;
  The bottle of beer was over-thick,
  So he jump'd into a club-stick;
  The club-stick was over-narrow,
  So he jump'd into a wheel-barrow;
  The wheel-barrow began to crack,
  So he jump'd on to a hay-stack;
  The hay-stack began to blaze,
  So he did nothing but cough and sneeze!

    [Footnote A: The pod or shell of a pea.]


CCCLXXVII.

  I saw a ship a-sailing,
    A-sailing on the sea;
  And, oh! it was all laden
    With pretty things for thee!

  There were comfits in the cabin,
    And apples in the hold;
  The sails were made of silk,
    And the masts were made of gold:

  The four-and-twenty sailors,
    That stood between the decks,
  Were four-and-twenty white mice,
    With chains about their necks.

  The captain was a duck,
    With a packet on his back;
  And when the ship began to move,
    The captain said, "Quack! quack!"


CCCLXXVIII.

  Barney Bodkin broke his nose,
  Without feet we can't have toes;
  Crazy folks are always mad,
  Want of money makes us sad.


CCCLXXIX.

  If a man who turnips cries
  Cries not when his father dies,
  It is a proof that he would rather
  Have a turnip than his father.

  Hushy baby, my doll, I pray you don't cry,

  Dance, little baby, dance up high,
  Never mind, baby, mother is by;

  With blue ribbands to tie on it,

  Hush, hush, hush, hush!

  And I dance mine own child,
  Hush, hush, hush, hush!


CCCLXXXVII.

  Hush thee, my babby,
  Lie still with thy daddy,
    Thy mammy has gone to the mill,
  To grind thee some wheat,
  To make thee some meat,
    And so, my dear babby, lie still.


CCCLXXXVIII.

  Hey, my kitten, my kitten,
    And hey, my kitten, my deary!
  Such a sweet pet as this

  And here we go backwards and forwards,
    And here we go round, round, roundy.


CCCLXXXIX.

  Oh, I fear my poor baby will die!

  When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,
  When the bough bends, the cradle will fall,
  Down will come baby, bough, cradle, and all.


CCCXCV.

      Ride, baby, ride,
      Pretty baby shall ride,
  And have a little puppy-dog tied to her side,
  And little pussy-cat tied to the other,
  And away she shall ride to see her grandmother,
      To see her grandmother,
      To see her grandmother.


CCCXCVI.

  Bye, baby bunting,
  Daddy's gone a hunting,
  To get a little hare's skin
  To wrap a baby bunting in.


CCCXCVII.

  Give me a blow, and I'll beat 'em,
    Why did they vex my baby?
  Kissy, kiss, kissy, my honey,
    And cuddle your nurse, my deary.


CCCXCVIII.

  My dear cockadoodle, my jewel, my joy,
  My darling, my honey, my pretty sweet boy;
  Before I do rock thee with soft lullaby,
  Give me thy dear lips to be kiss'd, kiss'd, kiss'd.


CCCXCIX.

    [A favourite lullaby in the north of England fifty years ago,
    and perhaps still heard. The last word is pronounced _bee_.]

  Hush-a-bye, lie still and sleep,
  It grieves me sore to see thee weep,
  For when thou weep'st thou wearies me,
  Hush-a-bye, lie still and _bye_.


CCCC.

    [From _Yorkshire_ and _Essex_. A nursery-cry.--It is also
    sometimes sung in the streets by boys who have small figures
    of wool, wood, or gypsum, &c. of lambs to sell.]

      Young Lambs to sell!
      Young Lambs to sell!
  If I'd as much money as I can tell,
  I never would cry--Young Lambs to sell!


CCCCI.

    [From _Yorkshire_. A nursery-cry.]

  Rabbit, Rabbit, Rabbit-Pie!
  Come, my ladies, come and buy;
  Else your babies they will cry.


CCCCII.

  To market, to market,
    To buy a plum cake;
  Home again, home again,
    Ne'er a one baked;
  The baker is dead and all his men,
  And we must go to market again.


CCCCIII.

  Rock well my cradle,
    And "bee baa," my son;
  You shall have a new gown,
    When ye lord comes home.

  Oh! still my child, Orange,
    Still him with a bell;
  I can't still him, ladie,
    Till you come down yoursell!


CCCCIV.

  Where was a sugar and fretty?
    And where was jewel and spicy?
  Hush-a-bye, babe in a cradle,
    And we'll go away in a tricy!


CCCCV.

  I'll buy you a tartan bonnet,
  And some feathers to put on it,
  Tartan trews and a phillibeg,
  Because you are so like your daddy.

    [The first line of the following is the burden of a song in
    the 'Tempest,' act i, sc. 2. and also of one in the 'Merchant
    of Venice, act iii, sc. 2.]

  Ding dong bell,
  Pussy's in the well!
  Who put her in?--
  Little Tommy Lin.
  Who pulled her out?--
  Dog with long snout.
  What a naughty boy was that
  To drown poor pussy-cat,
  Who never did any harm,
  But kill'd the mice in his father's barn.


CCCCVII.

  Hey ding a ding, what shall I sing?
  How many holes in a skimmer?
  Four and twenty,--my stomach is empty;
  Pray, mamma, give me some dinner.


CCCCVIII.

  Cock a doodle doo!
  My dame has lost her shoe;
  My master's lost his fiddling stick,
  And don't know what to do.

  Cock a doodle doo!
  What is my dame to do?
  Till master finds his fiddling stick,
  She'll dance without her shoe.

  Cock a doodle doo!
  My dame has lost her shoe,
  And master's found his fiddling stick,
  Sing doodle doodle doo!

  Cock a doodle doo!
  My dame will dance with you,
  While master fiddles his fiddling stick.
  For dame and doodle doo.

  Cock a doodle doo!
  Dame has lost her shoe;
  Gone to bed and scratch'd her head,
  And can't tell what to do.


CCCCIX.

  Diddledy, diddledy, dumpty;
  The cat ran up the plum-tree.
      I'll lay you a crown
      I'll fetch you down;
  So diddledy, diddledy, dumpty.


CCCCX.

  Little Tee Wee,
  He went to sea
  In an open boat;
  And while afloat
  The little boat bended,
  And my story's ended.


CCCCXI.

  Sing, sing, what shall I sing?
  The cat has eat the pudding-string;
  Do, do, what shall I do?
  The cat has bit it quite in two.


CCCCXII.

    [I do not know whether the following may have reference to the
    game of handy-dandy, mentioned in 'King Lear,' act iv, sc. 6,
    and in Florio's 'New World of Words,' 1611, p. 57.]

  Handy Spandy, Jack-a-dandy,
  Loved plum-cake and sugar-candy;
  He bought some at a grocer's shop,
  And out he came, hop, hop, hop.


CCCCXIII.

  Tiddle liddle lightum,
    Pitch and tar;
  Tiddle liddle lightum,
    What's that for?


CCCCXIV.

  Sing jigmijole, the pudding-bowl,
    The table and the frame;
  My master he did cudgel me
    For speaking of my dame.


CCCCXV.

  Deedle, deedle, dumpling, my son John
  Went to bed with his trowsers on;
  One shoe off, the other shoe on,
  Deedle, deedle, dumpling, my son John.


CCCCXVI.

  Dibbity, dibbity, dibbity, doe.
  Give me a pancake
      And I'll go.
  Dibbity, dibbity, dibbity, ditter,
  Please to give me
      A bit of a fritter.


CCCCXVII.

  Feedum, fiddledum fee,
  The cat's got into the tree.
    Pussy, come down,
    Or I'll crack your crown,
  And toss you into the sea.


CCCCXVIII.

    Little Jack a Dandy
    Wanted sugar-candy,
  And fairly for it cried;
    But little Billy Cook
    Who always reads his book,
  Shall have a horse to ride.


CCCCXIX.

  Hyder iddle diddle dell,
  A yard of pudding's not an ell;
  Not forgetting tweedle-dye,
  A tailor's goose will never fly.


CCCCXX.

  Gilly Silly Jarter,
  Who has lost a garter?
    In a shower of rain,
  The miller found it,
  The miller ground it,
    And the miller gave it to Silly again.


CCCCXXI.

    Hub a dub dub,
    Three men in a tub;
  And who do you think they be?
    The butcher, the baker,
    The candlestick-maker;
  Turn 'em out, knaves all three!


CCCCXXII.

  Hey diddle, dinketty, poppety, pet,
  The merchants of London they wear scarlet;
  Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem,
  So merrily march the merchantmen.


CCCCXXIII.

  Fiddle-de-dee, fiddle-de-dee,
  The fly shall marry the humble-bee.
  They went to the church, and married was she,
  The fly has married the humble-bee.


CCCCXXIV.

  Hey, dorolot, dorolot!
    Hey, dorolay, dorolay!
  Hey, my bonny boat, bonny boat,
    Hey, drag away, drag away!


CCCCXXV.

  A cat came fiddling out of a barn,
  With a pair of bag-pipes under her arm;
  She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee,
  The mouse has married the humble-bee;
  Pipe, cat,--dance, mouse,
  We'll have a wedding at our good house.


CCCCXXVI.

    Hey! diddle, diddle,
    The cat and the fiddle,
  The cow jumped over the moon;
    The little dog laugh'd
    To see the sport,
  While the dish ran after the spoon.


CCCCXXVII.

  Doodledy, doodledy, doodledy, dan,
  I'll have a piper to be my good man;
  And if I get less meat, I shall get game,
  Doodledy, doodledy, doodledy, dan.


CCCCXXVIII.

  Tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee
    Resolved to have a battle,
  For tweedle-dum said tweedle-dee
    Had spoiled his nice new rattle.
  Just then flew by a monstrous crow,
    As big as a tar-barrel,
  Which frightened both the heroes so,
    They quite forgot their quarrel.


CCCCXXIX.

    Come dance a jig
    To my Granny's pig,
  With a raudy, rowdy, dowdy;
    Come dance a jig
    To my Granny's pig,
  And pussy-cat shall crowdy.


CCCCXXX.

  Pussicat, wussicat, with a white foot,
  When is your wedding? for I'll come to't.
  The beer's to brew, the bread's to bake,
  Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, don't be too late.


CCCCXXXI.

  Ding, dong, darrow,
  The cat and the sparrow;
  The little dog has burnt his tail,
  And he shall be hang'd to-morrow.


CCCCXXXII.

  Little Dicky Dilver
  Had a wife of silver,
  He took a stick and broke her back,
  And sold her to the miller;
  The miller would'nt have her,
  So he threw her in the river.


CCCCXXXIII.

  To market, to market, to buy a fat pig,
    Home again, home again, dancing a jig;
  Ride to the market to buy a fat hog,
    Home again, home again, jiggety-jog.


CCCCXXXIV.

  Doodle, doodle, doo,
  The princess lost her shoe;
    Her highness hopp'd,
    The fidler stopped,
  Not knowing what to do.


CCCCXXXV.

  Rompty-iddity, row, row, row,
  If I had a good supper, I could eat it now.


CCCCXXXVI.

    [Magotty-pie is given in MS. Lands. 1033, fol. 2, as a Wiltshire
    word for a magpie. See also 'Macbeth,' act iii, sc. 4. The same
    term occurs in the dictionaries of Hollyband, Cotgrave, and
    Minsheu.]

  Round about, round about,
    Magotty-pie,
  My father loves good ale,
    And so do I.


CCCCXXXVII.

  High, ding, cockatoo-moody,
  Make a bed in a barn, I will come to thee;
  High, ding, straps of leather,
  Two little puppy-dogs tied together;
  One by the head, and one by the tail,
  And over the water these puppy-dogs sail.


CCCCXXXVIII.

    [Our collection of nursery songs may appropriately be
    concluded with the Quaker's commentary on one of the greatest
    favourites--Hey! diddle, diddle. We have endeavoured, as far
    as practicable, to remove every line from the present edition
    that could offend the most fastidious ear; but the following
    annotations on a song we cannot be induced to omit, would
    appear to suggest that our endeavours are scarcely likely to
    be attended with success.]

  "Hey! diddle, diddle,
  The cat and the fiddle"--

    Yes, thee may say that, for that is nonsense.

  "The cow jumped over the moon"--

    Oh no! Mary, thee musn't say that, for that is a falsehood;
    thee knows a cow could never jump over the moon; but a cow may
    jump under it; so thee ought to say--"The cow jumped _under_
    the moon." Yes,--

  "The cow jumped under the moon;
  The little dog laughed"--

    Oh Mary, stop. How can a little dog laugh? thee knows a
    little dog can't laugh. Thee ought to say--"The little dog
    _barked_--to see the sport,"

  "And the dish ran after the spoon"--

    Stop, Mary, stop. A dish could never run after a spoon; thee
    ought to know that. Thee had better say--"And the _cat_ ran
    after the spoon." So,--

  "Hey! diddle, diddle,
  The cat and the fiddle,
    The cow jump'd _under_ the moon;
  The little dog _bark'd_,
  To see the sport,
    And the _cat_ ran after the spoon!"

FOURTEENTH CLASS.

LOVE AND MATRIMONY.


CCCCXXXIX.

  As I was going up Pippen-hill,
    Pippen-hill was dirty,
  There I met a pretty miss,
    And she dropt me a curtsey.

  Little miss, pretty miss,
    Blessings light upon you!
  If I had half-a-crown a day,
    I'd spend it all on you.


CCCCXL.

  Brave news is come to town,
    Brave news is carried;
  Brave news is come to town,
    Jemmy Dawson's married.


CCCCXLI.

  Willy, Willy Wilkin,
  Kissed the maids a-milking,
                    Fa, la, la!
  And with his merry daffing,
  He set them all a laughing.
                    Ha, ha, ha!


CCCCXLII.

  It's once I courted as pretty a lass,
  As ever your eyes did see;
  But now she's come to such a pass,
  She never will do for me.
  She invited me to her own house,
  Where oft I'd been before,
  And she tumbled me into the hog-tub,
  And I'll never go there any more.


CCCCXLIII.

  Sylvia, sweet as morning air,
  Do not drive me to despair:
  Long have I sighed in vain,
  Now I am come again,
    Will you be mine or no, no-a-no,--
    Will you be mine or no?

  Simon pray leave off your suit,
  For of your courting you'll reap no fruit,
  I would rather give a crown
  Than be married to a clown;
    Go for a booby, go, no-a-no,--
    Go, for a booby, go.


CCCCXLIV.

  What care I how black I be,
  Twenty pounds will marry me;
  If twenty won't, forty shall,
  I am my mother's bouncing girl!


CCCCXLV.

  "Where have you been all the day,
      My boy Willy?"
  "I've been all the day,
  Courting of a lady gay:
  But oh! she's too young
  To be taken from her mammy."

  "What work can she do,
      My boy Willy?
  Can she bake and can she brew,
      My boy Willy?"
  "She can brew and she can bake,
  And she can make our wedding cake:
  But oh! she's too young
  To be taken from her mammy."

  "What age may she be? What age may she be?
      My boy Willy?"
  "Twice two, twice seven,
  Twice ten twice eleven:
  But oh! she's too young
  To be taken from her mammy."


CCCCXLVI.

    [This is part of a little work called 'Authentic Memoirs of
    the little Man and the little Maid, with some interesting
    particulars of their lives,' which I suspect is more modern
    than the following. Walpole printed a small broadside
    containing a different version.]

      There was a little man,
      And he woo'd a little maid,
  And he said, "little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?
      I have little more to say,
      Than will you, yea or nay,
  For least said is soonest mended-ded, ded, ded."

      The little maid replied,
      Some say a little sighed,
  "But what shall we have for to eat, eat, eat?
      Will the love that you're so rich in
      Make a fire in the kitchen?
  Or the little god of Love turn the spit, spit, spit?"


CCCCXLVII.

  There was a little boy and a little girl
  Lived in an alley;
  Says the little boy to the little girl,
  "Shall I, oh! shall I?"

  Says the little girl to the little boy,
  "What shall we do?"
  Says the little boy to the little girl,
  "I will kiss you."


CCCCXLVIII.

    A cow and a calf,
    An ox and a half,
  Forty good shillings and three;
    Is that not enough tocher
    For a shoe-maker's daughter,
  A bonny lass with a black e'e?


CCCCXLIX.

  O the little rusty, dusty, rusty miller!
  I'll not change my wife for either gold or siller.

    My dear Nicholas Wood?
  We will be married on Monday,
    And will not that be very good?
  What, shall we be married no sooner?
    Why sure the man's gone wood![*]

  What shall we have for our dinner,
    My dear Nicholas Wood?
  We will have bacon and pudding,
    And will not that be very good?
  What, shall we have nothing more?
    Why sure the man's gone wood!

  Who shall we have at our wedding,
    My dear Nicholas Wood?
  We will have mammy and daddy,
    And will not that be very good?
  What, shall we have nobody else?
    Why sure the man's gone wood!

  Tommy Trot, a man of law,
  Sold his bed and lay upon straw:
  Sold the straw and slept on grass,
  To buy his wife a looking-glass.

  "Little maid, pretty maid, whither goest thou?"
  "Down in the forest to milk my cow."
  "Shall I go with thee?" "No, not now;
  When I send for thee, then come thou."


CCCCLXI.

      I am a pretty wench,
      And I come a great way hence,
  And sweethearts I can get none:
      But every dirty sow,
      Can get sweethearts enow,
  And I, pretty wench, can get never a one.


CCCCLXII.

  Birds of a feather flock together,

  The young man that I love,
    Come after me and mow!

CCCCLXIV.

  Jack Sprat could eat no fat,
  His wife could eat no lean;
  And so, betwixt them both, you see,
  They lick'd the platter clean.


CCCCLXV.

  Little Jack Dandy-prat was my first suitor;
  He had a dish and a spoon, and he'd some pewter;
  He'd linen and woollen, and woollen and linen,

THE KEYS OF CANTERBURY.

  Oh, madam, I will give you the keys of Canterbury,
  To set all the bells ringing when we shall be merry,
  If you will but walk abroad with me,
  If you will but walk with me.

  Sir, I'll not accept of the keys of Canterbury,
  To set all the bells ringing when we shall be merry;
  Neither will I walk abroad with thee,
  Neither will I talk with thee!

  Oh, madam, I will give you a fine carved comb,
  To comb out your ringlets when I am from home,
  If you will but walk with me, &c.
  Sir, I'll not accept, &c.

  Oh, madam, I will give you a pair of shoes of cork,[*]
  One made in London, the other made in York,
  If you will but walk with me, &c.
  Sir, I'll not accept, &c.

  Madam, I will give you a sweet silver bell,[+]
  To ring up your maidens when you are not well,
  If you will but walk with me, &c.
  Sir, I'll not accept, &c.

  Oh, my man John, what can the matter be?
  I love the lady and the lady loves not me!
  Neither will she walk abroad with me,
  Neither will she talk with me.

  Oh, master dear, do not despair,
  The lady she shall be, shall be your only dear,
  And she will walk and talk with thee,
  And she will walk with thee!

  Oh, madam, I will give you the keys of my chest,
  To count my gold and silver when I am gone to rest,
  If you will but walk abroad with me,
  If you will but talk with me.

  Oh, sir, I will accept of the keys of your chest,
  To count your gold and silver when you are gone to rest,
  And I will walk abroad with thee,
  And I will talk with thee!

  _He._   If you with me will go, my love,

          If you will have me, my love,
          I will have thee, my love,
              So let the milk-pail stand still.

  _She._  Since you have said so, my love,

  Master I have, and I am his man,
  Gallop a dreary dun;
  Master I have, and I am his man,

  With a heighly gaily gamberally,
    Higgledy piggledy, niggledy, niggledy,
    Gallop a dreary dun.


CCCCLXX.

  I doubt, I doubt my fire is out,

  Thomas and Annis met in the dark.
    "Good morning," said Thomas.
    "Good morning," said Annis.
  And so they began to talk.

  "I'll give you," says Thomas,
  "Give me," said Annis;
    "I prithee, love, tell me what?"
  "Some nuts," said Thomas.
  "Some nuts," said Annis;
    "Nuts are good to crack."

  "I love you," said Thomas.
  "Love me!" said Annis;
    "I prithee love tell me where?"
  "In my heart," said Thomas.
  "In your heart!" said Annis;
    "How came you to love me there?"

  "I'll marry you," said Thomas.
  "Marry me!" said Annis;
    "I prithee, love, tell me when?"
  "Next Sunday," said Thomas.
  "Next Sunday," said Annis;
    "I wish next Sunday were come."


CCCCLXXIII.

  Saw ye aught of my love a coming from ye market!
    A peck of meal upon her back,
    A babby in her basket;
  Saw ye aught of my love a coming from the market?


CCCCLXXIV.

    [This nursery song may probably commemorate a part of Tom
    Thumb's history, extant in a Little Danish work, treating of
    'Swain Tomling, a man no bigger than a thumb, who would be
    married to a woman three ells and three quarters long.' See
    Mr. Thoms' Preface to 'Tom & Lincoln,' p. xi.]

  I had a little husband,
    No bigger than my thumb;
  I put him in a pint pot,
    And there I bid him drum.

  I bought a little horse,
    That galloped up and down;
  I bridled him, and saddled him,
    And sent him out of town.

  I gave him some garters,
    To garter up his hose,
  And a little handkerchief,
    To wipe his pretty nose.


CCCCLXXV.

  Can you make me a cambric shirt,
    Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
  Without any seam or needlework?
    And you shall be a true lover of mine.

  Can you wash it in yonder well,
    Parsley, &c.
  Where never sprung water, nor rain ever fell?
    And you, &c.

  Can you dry it on yonder thorn,
    Parsley, &c.
  Which never bore blossom since Adam was born?
    And you, &c.

  Now you have ask'd me questions three,
    Parsley, &c.
  I hope you'll answer as many for me,
    And you, &c.

  Where have you been to-day, Billy, my son?
  Where have you been to-day, my only man!

  What have you ate to-day, Billy, my son?

  I married my wife by the light of the moon,
    A tidy housewife, a tidy one;

    A tidy, &c.
  She takes up the poker to roll out the paste,

  "Madam, I am come to court you,
  If your favour I can gain."
  "Ah, Ah!" said she, "you are a bold fellow,
  If I e'er see your face again!"

  "Madam, I have rings and diamonds,
  Madam, I have houses and land,
  Madam, I have a world of treasure,
  All shall be at your command."

  "I care not for rings and diamonds,
  I care not for houses and lands,
  I care not for a world of treasure,
  So that I have but a handsome man."

  "Madam, you think much of beauty,
  Beauty hasteneth to decay,
  For the fairest of flowers that grow in summer
  Will decay and fade away."

  Bessy Bell and Mary Gray,[*]
    They were two bonny lasses:
  They built their house upon the lea,
    And covered it with rashes.

  Bessy kept the garden gate,
    And Mary kept the pantry:
  Bessy always had to wait,
    While Mary lived in plenty.

    [Footnote *: The common tradition respecting these celebrated
    beauties is as follows:--"In the year 1666, when the plague
    raged at Perth, these ladies retired into solitude, to avoid
    infection; built on a small streamlet, tributary to the
    Almond, in a sequestered corner called _Burn-brae_, a bower,
    and lived in it together, till a young man, whom they both
    tenderly loved, in his visits communicated to them the fatal
    contagion, of which they soon after died."]

  And all the meat he got
    He put upon a shelf.

    To get himself a wife.

  The lanes they were so broad,
    And the fields they were so narrow,
  He couldn't get his wife home
    Without a wheelbarrow.

  The wheelbarrow broke,
    My wife she got a kick,
  The deuce take the wheelbarrow,
    That spared my wife's neck.

            Dusty was the siller,
            Dusty was the kiss
            I'd from the dusty miller.
            If I had my pockets
            Full of gold and siller,
            I would give it all
            To my dusty miller.

  _Chorus._ O the little, little,
            Rusty, dusty, miller.

  For your fairest daughter,
    Lily bright and shine a'.

  Then there she is for you,
    My a dildin, my a daldin;

  And dance and sing all the night.

  But sit on a cushion and sow a fine seam,
  And feed upon strawberries, sugar, and cream!

NATURAL HISTORY.


CCCCXCV.

  The cuckoo's a fine bird,
    He sings as he flies;
  He brings us good tidings,
    He tells us no lies.

  He sucks little birds' eggs,
    To make his voice clear;
  And when he sings "cuckoo!"
    The summer is near.


CCCCXCVI. [A provincial version of the same.]

  The cuckoo's a vine bird,
    A zengs as a vlies;
  A brengs us good tidins,

  And the mwore a cries "cuckoo!"
    The zummer draws near.

  I had a little dog, and his name was Blue Bell,
  I gave him some work, and he did it very well;
  I sent him up stairs to pick up a pin,
  He stepped in the coal-scuttle up to the chin;
  I sent him to the garden to pick some sage,
  He tumbled down and fell in a rage;
  I sent him to the cellar to draw a pot of beer,
  He came up again and said there was none there.


CCCCXCVIII.

  The cat sat asleep by the side of the fire,
    The mistress snored loud as a pig:

    And struck up a bit of a jig.


CCCCXCIX.

  I had a little hobby-horse, and it was well shod,
  It carried me to the mill-door, trod, trod, trod;
  When I got there I gave a great shout,
  Down came the hobby-horse, and I cried out.
  Fie upon the miller, he was a great beast,
  He would not come to my house, I made a little feast,
  I had but little, but I would give him some,
  For playing of his bag-pipes and beating his drum.

    A little brown mouse,

  And stole it all away.


DII.

    [The snail scoops out hollows, little rotund chambers, in
    limestone, for its residence. This habit of the animal is so
    important in its effects, as to have attracted the attention
    of geologists, and Dr. Buckland alluded to it at the meeting
    of the British Association in 1841. See Chambers' 'Popular
    Rhymes,' p. 43. The following rhyme is a boy's invocation to
    the snail to come out of such holes.]

  Snail, snail, come out of your hole,
  Or else I will beat you as black as a coal.


DIII.

    Sneel, snaul,
  Robbers are coming to pull down your wall;

DVI.

    The sow came in with the saddle,
    The little pig rock'd the cradle
    The dish jump'd over the table
    To see the pot with the ladle.
    The broom behind the butt
    Call'd the dish-clout a nasty slut:
  Oh! Oh! says the gridiron, can't you agree?
  I'm the head constable,--come along with me.


DVII.

  "What do they call you?"
  "Patchy Dolly."
  "Where were you born?"
  "In the cow's horn."
  "Where were you bred?"
  "In the cow's head."
  "Where will you die?"
  "In the cow's eye."


DVIII.

  As I went over the water,
  The water went over me.

  And knocked out all their teeth.


DIX.

  Four and twenty tailors went to kill a snail,
  The best man among them durst not touch her tail;

DX.

    [A Dorsetshire version.]

  'Twas the twenty-ninth of May, 'twas a holiday,
  Four and twenty tailors set out to hunt a snail;
  The snail put forth his horns, and roared like a bull,
  Away ran the tailors, and catch the snail who wull.


DXI.

  Croak! said the Toad, I'm hungry, I think,
  To-day I've had nothing to eat or to drink,
  I'll crawl to a garden and jump through the pales,
  And there I'll dine nicely on slugs and on snails;
  Ho, ho! quoth the Frog, is that what you mean?
  Then I'll hop away to the next meadow stream,
  There I will drink, and eat worms and slugs too,
  And then I shall have a good dinner like you.


DXII.

    Waft your wings together,
  And carry the good king's daughter
    Over the one strand river.

  I've been up to London to look at the queen.
  Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you there?

DXIV.

  I had a little dog, and they called him Buff;
  I sent him to the shop for a hap'orth of snuff;

  Says he, "I'll shoot you, silly bird."
    Fiddle, faddle, feedle.


DXVIII.

  When the snow is on the ground,
    Little Robin Red-breast grieves;
  For no berries can be found,
    And on the trees there are no leaves.

  The air is cold, the worms are hid,
    For this poor bird what can be done?
  We'll strew him here some crumbs of bread,
    And then he'll live till the snow is gone.


DXIX.

  A pie sate on a pear-tree,
  A pie sate on a pear-tree,
  A pie sate on a pear-tree,
  Heigh O, heigh O, heigh O!
  Once so merrily hopp'd she,
  Twice so merrily hopp'd she,
  Thrice so merrily hopp'd she,
  Heigh O, heigh O, heigh O!

  There was an old crow
    Sat upon a clod:

  Away I must.

  And now, good sir, your horse is shod."

  But he shook his little tail,
  And far away he flew.

  She brought it home in less than an hour;
  She baked me my bread, she brew'd me my ale,
  She sat by the fire and told many a fine tale.

  Pussey cat sits by the fire,
    How did she come there?
  In walks the little dog,

  "I thank you kindly, little dog,
    I fare as well as you!"

    [A north country version of a very common nursery rhyme, sung
    by a child, who imitates the crowing of a cock.]

  And knows not what to do.

  Pretty John Watts,
  We are troubled with rats,
  Will you drive them out of the house?
  We have mice, too, in plenty,
  That feast in the pantry;
  But let them stay,
  And nibble away;
  What harm in a little brown mouse?

      Rosy, and Colin, and Dun.

  And it'll be gane
  By I get yhame.

  I had a little pony,
    His name was Dapple-gray,

  I would not lend my pony now
    For all the lady's hire.

  Bah, bah, black sheep,

  My little dame is not at home!
  I'll saddle my cock, and bridle my hen,
  And fetch my little dame home again!
  Home she came, tritty trot,
  She asked for the porridge she left in the pot;
  Some she ate and some she shod,
  And some she gave to the truckler's dog;
  She took up the ladle and knocked its head,
  And now poor Dapsy dog is dead!


DLXXXIX.

  Little boy blue, come blow up your horn,
  The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn;
  Where's the little boy that looks after the sheep?
  He's under the hay-cock fast asleep.
  Will you wake him? No, not I;
  For if I do, he'll be sure to cry.

    Goosey, goosey, gander,
    Where shall I wander?
  Up stairs, down stairs,
    And in my lady's chamber;
  There I met an old man
    That would not say his prayers;
  I took him by the left leg,
    And threw him down stairs.


DXCI.

  Who stands yonder?
  Little Betsy Baker;
  Take her up, and shake her.

DXCV.

    [The original of 'The house that Jack built' is presumed to be
    a hymn in _Sepher Haggadah_, fol. 23, a translation of which
    is here given. The historical interpretation was first given
    by P. N. Leberecht, at Leipsic, in 1731, and is printed in the
    'Christian Reformer,' vol. xvii, p. 28. The original is in
    the Chaldee language, and it may be mentioned that a very fine
    Hebrew manuscript of the fable, with illuminations, is in the
    possession of George Offer, Esq. of Hackney.]

  1.  A _kid_, _a kid_, my father bought,
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  2.  Then came _the cat_, and ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  3.  Then came _the dog_, and bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  4.  Then came _the staff_, and beat the dog,
      That bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  5.  Then came _the fire_, and burned the staff,
      That beat the dog,
      That bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  6.  Then came _the water_, and quenched the fire,
      That burned the staff,
      That beat the dog,
      That bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  7.  Then came _the ox_, and drank the water,
      That quenched the fire,
      That burned the staff,
      That beat the dog,
      That bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  8.  Then came _the butcher_, and slew the ox,
      That drank the water,
      That quenched the fire,
      That burned the staff,
      That beat the dog,
      That bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  9.  Then came _the angel of death_, and killed the butcher,
      That slew the ox,
      That drank the water,
      That quenched the fire,
      That burned the staff,
      That beat the dog,
      That bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

  10. Then came _the Holy One_, blessed be He!
      And killed the angel of death,
      That killed the butcher,
      That slew the ox,
      That drank the water,
      That quenched the fire,
      That burned the staff,
      That beat the dog,
      That bit the cat,
      That ate the kid,
      That my father bought
      For two pieces of money:
                          A kid, a kid.

    The following is the interpretation:

    1. The kid, which was one of the pure animals, denotes the
    Hebrews.

    The father, by whom it was purchased, is Jehovah, who
    represents himself as sustaining this relation to the Hebrew
    nation. The two pieces of money signify Moses and Aaron,
    through whose mediation the Hebrews were brought out of Egypt.

    2. The cat denotes the Assyrians, by whom the ten tribes were
    carried into captivity.

    3. The dog is symbolical of the Babylonians.

    4. The staff signifies the Persians.

    5. The fire indicates the Grecian empire under Alexander the
    Great.

    6. The water betokens the Roman, or the fourth of the great
    monarchies to whose dominions the Jews were subjected.

    7. The ox is a symbol of the Saracens, who subdued Palestine,
    and brought it under the caliphate.

    8. The butcher that killed the ox denotes the crusaders,
    by whom the Holy Land was wrested out of the hands of the
    Saracens.

    9. The angel of death signifies the Turkish power, by which
    the land of Palestine was taken from the Franks, and to which
    it is still subject.

    10. The commencement of the tenth stanza is designed to show
    that God will take signal vengeance on the Turks, immediately
    after whose overthrow the Jews are to be restored to their
    own land, and live under the government of their long-expected
    Messiah.

"An old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked
sixpence. 'What,' said she, 'shall I do with this little sixpence? I
will go to market, and buy a little pig.' As she was coming home, she
came to a stile: the piggy would not go over the stile.

"She went a little further, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog,
'Dog! bite pig; piggy won't go over the stile; and I shan't get home
to-night.' But the dog would not.

"She went a little further, and she met a stick. So she said, 'Stick!
stick! beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile;
and I shan't get home to-night.' But the stick would not.

"She went a little further, and she met a fire. So she said, 'Fire!
fire! burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig,' (_and so
forth, always repeating the foregoing words_.) But the fire would not.

"She went a little further, and she met some water. So she said,
'Water! water! quench fire; fire won't burn stick,' &c. But the water
would not.

"She went a little further, and she met an ox. So she said, 'Ox! ox!
drink water; water won't quench fire' &c. But the ox would not.

"She went a little further, and she met a butcher. So she said,
'Butcher! butcher! kill ox; ox won't drink water,' &c. But the butcher
would not.

"She went a little further, and she met a rope. So she said, 'Rope!
rope! hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox,' &c. But the rope would
not.

"She went a little further, and she met a rat. So she said, 'Rat! rat!
gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher,' &c. But the rat would not.

"She went a little further, and she met a cat. So she said, 'Cat! cat!
kill rat; rat won't gnaw rope,' &c. But the cat said to her, 'If you
will go to yonder cow, and fetch me a saucer of milk, I will kill the
rat.' So away went the old woman to the cow.

"But the cow said to her, 'If you will go to yonder haystack,[*] and
fetch me a handful of hay, I'll give you the milk.' So away went the
old woman to the haystack; and she brought the hay to the cow.

"As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old woman the
milk; and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat.

"As soon as the cat had lapped up the milk, the cat began to kill
the rat; the rat began to gnaw the rope; the rope began to hang the
butcher; the butcher began to kill the ox; the ox began to drink the
water; the water began to quench the fire; the fire began to burn the
stick; the stick began to beat the dog; the dog began to bite the pig;
the little pig in a fright jumped over the stile; and so the old woman
got home that night."

    [Footnote *: Or haymakers, proceeding thus in the stead of
    the rest of this paragraph:--"And fetch me a wisp of hay,
    I'll give you the milk.--So away the old woman went, but the
    haymakers said to her,--If you will go to yonder stream, and
    fetch us a bucket of water, we'll give you the hay. So away
    the old woman went, but when she got to the stream, she found
    the bucket was full of holes. So she covered the bottom with
    pebbles, and then filled the bucket with water, and away she
    went back with it to the haymakers; and they gave her a wisp
    of hay."]

Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house,
Titty Mouse went a leasing, and Tatty Mouse went a leasing,
  So they both went a leasing.

Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse
      leased an ear of corn,
  So they both leased an ear of corn.

Titty Mouse made a pudding, and Tatty Mouse made a pudding,
  So they both made a pudding.

And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil,
But when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled over,
      and scalded her to death.

Then Tatty sat down and wept; then a three legged stool said, Tatty
why do you weep? Titty's dead, said Tatty, and so I weep; then said
the stool, I'll hop, so the stool hopped; then a besom in the corner
of the room said, Stool, why do you hop? Oh! said the stool, Titty's
dead, and Tatty weeps, and so I hop; then said the besom, I'll sweep,
so the besom began to sweep; then said the door, Besom, why do you
sweep? Oh! said the besom, Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the
stool hops, and so I sweep; then said the door, I'll jar, so the door
jarred; then said the window, Door, why do you jar? Oh! said the
door, Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the besom
sweeps, and so I jar; then said the window, I'll creak, so the window
creaked; now there was an old form outside the house, and when the
window creaked, the form said, Window, why do you creak? Oh! said the
window, Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the
besom sweeps, the door jars, and so I creak; then said the old form,
I'll run round the house, then the old form ran round the house; now
there was a fine large walnut tree growing by the cottage, and the
tree said to the form, Form, why do you run round the house? Oh! said
the form, Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the
besom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, and so I run round
the house; then said the walnut tree, I'll shed my leaves, so the
walnut tree shed all its beautiful green leaves; now there was a
little bird perched on one of the boughs of the tree, and when all the
leaves fell, it said, Walnut tree, why do you shed your leaves? Oh!
said the tree, Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the
besom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs
round the house, and so I shed my leaves; then said the little bird,
I'll moult all my feathers, so he moulted all his pretty feathers; now
there was a little girl walking below, carrying a jug of milk for her
brothers' and sisters' supper, and when she saw the poor little bird
moult all its feathers, she said, Little bird, why do you moult all
your feathers? Oh! said the little bird, Titty's dead, and Tatty
weeps, the stool hops, and the besom sweeps, the door jars, and the
window creaks, the old form runs round the house, the walnut tree
sheds its leaves, and so I moult all my feathers; then said the little
girl, I'll spill the milk, so she dropt the pitcher and spilt
the milk; now there was an old man just by on the top of a ladder
thatching a rick, and when he saw the little girl spill the milk, he
said, Little girl, what do you mean by spilling the milk, your little
brothers and sisters must go without their supper; then said the
little girl, Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the
besom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs
round the house, the walnut tree sheds all its leaves, the little bird
moults all its feathers, and so I spill the milk; Oh! said the old
man, then I'll tumble off the ladder and break my neck, so he tumbled
off the ladder and broke his neck; and when the old man broke his
neck, the great walnut tree fell down with a crash, and upset the old
form and house, and the house falling knocked the window out, and the
window knocked the door down, and the door upset the besom, the besom
upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse was buried beneath the
ruins.

  And some are gone to Chidley fair.


DCVI.

  Little boy, pretty boy, where was you born?
  In Lincolnshire, master: come blow the cow's horn.
  A half-penny pudding, a penny pie,
  A shoulder of mutton, and that love I.


DCVII

  My father and mother,
  My uncle and aunt,
  Be all gone to Norton,
  But little Jack and I.

  A little bit of powdered beef,
  And a great net of cabbage,
  The best meal I have had to-day,
  Is a good bowl of porridge.


DCVIII.

  I lost my mare in Lincoln lane,
    And couldn't tell where to find her,
  Till she came home both lame and blind,
    With never a tail behind her.


DCIX.

  Cripple Dick upon a stick,
    And Sandy on a sow,
  Riding away to Galloway,
    To buy a pound o' woo.


DCX.

  Little lad, little lad, where wast thou born?
  Far off in Lancashire, under a thorn,
  Where they sup sour milk in a ram's horn.

EIGHTEENTH CLASS--RELICS.


DCXI.

  The girl in the lane, that couldn't speak plain,
    Cried "gobble, gobble, gobble:"
  The man on the hill, that couldn't stand still,
    Went hobble, hobble, hobble.


DCXII.

  Hink, minx! the old witch winks,
    The fat begins to fry:
  There's nobody at home but jumping Joan,
    Father, mother, and I.


DCXIII.

    Baby and I
    Were baked in a pie,
  The gravy was wonderful hot:
    We had nothing to pay
    To the baker that day,
  And so we crept out of the pot.


DCXIV.

  What are little boys made of, made of,
  What are little boys made of?
  Snaps and snails, and puppy-dog's tails;
  And that's what little boys are made of, made of.
  What are little girls made of, made of, made of,
  What are little girls made of?
  Sugar and spice, and all that's nice;
  And that's what little girls are made of, made of.


DCXV.

  If a body meet a body,
    In a field of fitches;
  Can a body tell a body
    Where a body itches?


DCXVI.

  Charley wag,
  Eat the pudding and left the bag.


DCXVII.

  Girls and boys, come out to play,
  The moon doth shine as bright as day;
  Leave your supper, and leave your sleep,
  And come with your playfellows into the street.
  Come with a whoop, come with a call,
  Come with a good will or not at all.
  Up the ladder and down the wall,
  A halfpenny roll will serve us all.
  You find milk, and I'll find flour,
  And we'll have a pudding in half an hour.


DCXVIII.

  Hannah Bantry in the pantry,
    Eating a mutton bone;
  How she gnawed it, how she clawed it,
    When she found she was alone!


DCXIX.

  Rain, rain, go away,
  Come again another day;
  Little Arthur wants to play.


DCXX.

  Little girl, little girl, where have you been?
  Gathering roses to give to the queen.
  Little girl, little girl, what gave she you?
  She gave me a diamond as big as my shoe.


DCXXI.

      Hark, hark,
      The dogs do bark,
  Beggars are coming to town;
      Some in jags,
      Some in rags,
  And some in velvet gowns.


DCXXII.

    We're all in the dumps,
    For diamonds are trumps;
  The kittens are gone to St. Paul's!
    The babies are bit,
    The moon's in a fit,
  And the houses are built without walls.


DCXXIII.

  What's the news of the day,
  Good neighbour, I pray?
  They say the balloon
  Is gone up to the moon.


DCXXIV.

    Little Mary Ester,
    Sat upon a tester,
  Eating of curds and whey;
    There came a little spider,
    And sat him down beside her,
  And frightened Mary Ester away.


DCXXV.

  Shake a leg, wag a leg, when will you gang?
  At midsummer, mother, when the days are lang.


DCXXVI.

  Willy boy, Willy boy, where are you going?
    I'll go with you, if I may.
  I'm going to the meadow to see them a mowing,
    I'm going to help them make hay.


DCXXVII.

  To market, to market, a gallop, a trot,
  To buy some meat to put in the pot;
  Threepence a quarter, a groat a side,
  If it hadn't been kill'd, it must have died.


DCXXVIII.

  Come, let's to bed,
  Says Sleepy-head;
    Tarry a while, says Slow:
  Put on the pot,
  Says Greedy-gut,
    Let's sup before we go.

    Saturday, Sunday, Monday.


DCXXX.

  Daffy-down-dilly has come up to town,
  In a yellow petticoat, and a green gown.


DCXXXI.

  Little Tom Tucker
  Sings for his supper;
  What shall he eat?
  White bread and butter.
  How shall he cut it
  Without e'er a knife?
  How will he be married
  Without e'er a wife?


DCXXXII.

  I can weave diaper thick, thick, thick,
  And I can weave diaper thin,
  I can weave diaper out of doors
  And I can weave diaper in.


DCXXXIII.

    [The following is quoted in the song of Mad Tom. See my
    introduction to Shakespeare's Mids. Night's Dream, p. 55.]

  The man in the moon drinks claret,
    But he is a dull Jack-a-Dandy;
  Would he know a sheep's head from a carrot,
    He should learn to drink cider and brandy.


DCXXXIV.

    [A marching air.]

  Darby and Joan were dress'd in black,
  Sword and buckle behind their back;
  Foot for foot, and knee for knee,
  Turn about Darby's company.


DCXXXV.

  Barber, barber, shave a pig,
  How many hairs will make a wig?
  "Four and twenty, that's enough."
  Give the barber a pinch of snuff.


DCXXXVI.

  If all the seas were one sea,
  What a _great_ sea that would be!
  And if all the trees were one tree,
  What a _great_ tree that would be!
  And if all the axes were one axe,
  What a _great_ axe that would be!
  And if all the men were one man,
  What a _great_ man he would be!
  And if the _great_ man took the _great_ axe,
  And cut down the _great_ tree,
  And let it fall into the _great_ sea,
  What a splish splash _that_ would be!


DCXXXVII.

    I had a little moppet,
    I put it in my pocket,
  And fed it with corn and hay;
    Then came a proud beggar,
    And swore he would have her,
  And stole little moppet away.


DCXXXVIII.

  The barber shaved the mason,
    As I suppose
    Cut off his nose,
  And popp'd it in a basin.


DXXXCIX.

  Little Tommy Tacket,
      Sits upon his cracket;
  Half a yard of cloth will make him coat and jacket;
      Make him coat and jacket,
      Trowsers to the knee.
  And if you will not have him, you may let him be.


DCXL.

  Peg, peg, with a wooden leg,
    Her father was a miller:
  He tossed the dumpling at her head,
    And said he could not kill her.


DCXLI.

  Parson Darby wore a black gown,
  And every button cost half-a-crown;
  From port to port, and toe to toe,
  Turn the ship and away we go!


DCXLII.

  When Jacky's a very good boy,
    He shall have cakes and a custard;
  But when he does nothing but cry,
    He shall have nothing but mustard.


DCXLIII.

  Blow, wind, blow! and go, mill, go!
  That the miller may grind his corn;
  That the baker may take it,
  And into rolls make it,
  And send us some hot in the morn.


DCXLIV.

  The quaker's wife got up to bake,
    Her children all about her,
  She gave them every one a cake,
    And the miller wants his moulter.


DCXLV.

  Wash, hands, wash,
    Daddy's gone to plough,
  If you want your hands wash'd,
    Have them wash'd now.

    [A formula for making young children submit to the operation
    of having their hands washed. _Mutatis mutandis_, the lines
    will serve as a specific for everything of the kind, as
    brushing hair, &c.]


DCXLVI.

  My little old man and I fell out,
  I'll tell you what 'twas all about:
  I had money, and he had none,
  And that's the way the row begun.


DCXLVII.

  Who comes here?
    A grenadier.
  What do you want?
    A pot of beer.
  Where is your money?
    I've forgot.
  Get you gone,
    You drunken sot!


DCXLVIII.

  Go to bed, Tom!
  Go to bed, Tom!
  Drunk or sober,
  Go to bed, Tom!


DCXLIX.

  As I went over the water,
    The water went over me,
  I heard an old woman crying,
    Will you buy some furmity?


DCL.

  High diddle doubt, my candle out,
    My little maid is not at home:
  Saddle my hog, and bridle my dog,
    And fetch my little maid home.


DCLI.

  Around the green gravel the grass grows green,
  And all the pretty maids are plain to be seen;
  Wash them with milk, and clothe them with silk,
  And write their names with a pen and ink.


DCLII.

  As I was going to sell my eggs,
  I met a man with bandy legs,
  Bandy legs and crooked toes,
  I tripped up his heels, and he fell on his nose.


DCLIII.

    Old Sir Simon the king,
  And young Sir Simon the 'squire,
      And old Mrs. Hickabout
      Kicked Mrs. Kickabout
  Round about our coal fire!


DCLIV.

  A good child, a good child,
    As I suppose you be,
  Never laughed nor smiled
    At the tickling of your knee.


DCLV.

  Jacky, come give me thy fiddle
    If ever thou mean to thrive;
  Nay, I'll not give my fiddle,
    To any man alive.

  If I should give my fiddle,
    They'll think that I'm gone mad,
  For many a joyful day
    My fiddle and I have had.


DCLVI.

        Blenky my nutty-cock,
          Blenk him away;
        My nutty-cock's never
          Been blenk'd to-day.
  What wi' carding and spinning on't wheel,
  We've never had time to blenk nutty-cock weel;
  But let to-morrow come ever so sune,
  My nutty-cock it sall be blenk'd by nune.


DCLVII.

  To market, to market, to buy a plum-cake,
  Back again, back again, baby is late;
  To market, to market, to buy a plum-bun,
  Back again, back again, market is done.


DCLVIII.

  St. Thomas's-day is past and gone,
    And Christmas is a-most a-come,
        Maidens arise,
        And make your pies,
    And save poor tailor Bobby some.


DCLIX.

  How do you do, neighbour?
  Neighbour, how do you do?
    I am pretty well,
  And how does Cousin Sue do?
    She's pretty well,
  And sends her duty to you,
    So does bonnie Nell.
  Good lack, how does she do?

Transcriber' Note:

This book contains a lot of dialect, which has been retained.

page 2: 'fidlers' agrees with scan; retained, despite 'fiddle' in same
poem. 17th century and older spelling was not necessarily standardised,
even within the same sentence.

page 42: 'flee' is followed by 'Mr. Flea'. But 'flee' rhymes with 'Dee',
and has been retained.

page 75, and Index: "driving 's":
"The art of good driving 's a paradox quite," agrees with both scans,
and has been retained.

CCCLI.
The second small print explanatory note did not contain quote marks,
and they have not been added.

CCCLIII.
The missing opening and closing quote marks in the explanatory note
are implied by the first quote marks ("Eleven going for twelve."),
but have not been added.

CCCXCII.

'did'nt' retained: "O then my poor baby did'nt cry!"

CCCCXXXII.

'would'nt' retained: "The miller would'nt have her,"


Colons have been used extensively throughout the book, where, perhaps
a semi-colon would be used today. The colons have been retained, as
they seem to suggest a subtle nuance of meaning.


A few obvious punctuation errors have been repaired.
Old-fashioned, but correct, punctuation (which agrees with the scans)
has been retained.


There are, however, some apparently genuine typographical or
printer's errors.


Errata

page iv: 'doggrel' corrected to 'doggerel': "the place of the ancient
doggerel"

page 37: 'shin' corrected to 'chin': "No, no, by the hair of my chiny
chin chin."

page 92: 'buble' corrected to 'bubble': "Jack sing saddle oh,
        Blowsey boys bubble oh,"

page 110: Músicks' corrected to Musicks (accent not on orig. book cover)
(http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/ravenscroft/deuteromelia/deut_01small.html)

page 158: 'here' corrected to 'hear': "And hear what time of day;"

page 222: 'scarely' corrected to 'scarcely': "that our endeavours are
scarcely likely to be attended with success."

page 317: 'sat' corrected to 'sate':
     "A pie sate on a pear-tree,    259"

page 321: 'came' corrected to 'come':
     "Girls and boys, come out to play,    305"

page 332: 'thay' corrected to 'they':
     "What do they call you?,     255"


Sundry "Index" entries have been relocated for consistency.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
