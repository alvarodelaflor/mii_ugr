Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop and extend the               
              theory and methods of adaptive sampling, with particular                       
              attention to problems of estimation of abundance of a natural                  
              resource.  Such designs are particularly applicable to clumped or              
              aggregated distributions as are often found in sampling plants,                
              animals, fossile fuel resources; they may be equally promising                 
              for certain problems in epidemiology.  Properties of adaptive                  
              sampling designs will be derived; and comparisons of efficiency                
              will be made with conventional designs currently in widespread                 
              use.
