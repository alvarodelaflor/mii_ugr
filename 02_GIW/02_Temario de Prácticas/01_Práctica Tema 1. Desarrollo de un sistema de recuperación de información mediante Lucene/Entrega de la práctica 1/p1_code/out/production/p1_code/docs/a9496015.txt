Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of 5 deep (< 4000 m) current meter arrays will be deployed            
              across the Samoan passage and an additional current meter mooring              
              will be set across the Robie Ridge for a two year period (7/92 to              
              7/94) to measure the deep water exchange between the South and the             
              North Pacific. This experiment is part of the World Ocean                      
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
