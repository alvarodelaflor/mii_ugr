Abstract    :
              This project investigates sociological questions relating to                   
              demographic, epidemiologic and domestic transition in a sample of              
              Alaskan and Russian Far Eastern communities. A multi-trait, multi-             
              method design using several types of data is employed for                      
              controlled comparisons of independent socioeconomic, political,                
              historical and cultural factors. The results will form a basis for             
              international collaboration in areas of Native health and rapid                
              social change, the two must urgent concerns of northern indigenous             
              people. Native organizations in Alaska and the Russian north are               
              advisory to the project.
