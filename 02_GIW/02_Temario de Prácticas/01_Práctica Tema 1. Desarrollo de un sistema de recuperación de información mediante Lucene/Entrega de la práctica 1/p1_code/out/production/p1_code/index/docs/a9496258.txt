Abstract    :
              9320250  Wirsig-Wiechmann    Coordination of sensory, motor and neuroendocrine
              systems is  essential for survival of many species.  Indeed two nasal 
              chemosensory systems, the olfactory and vomeronasal systems, are  known to play
              a significant role in reproductive activities of  many vertebrates species. 
              The nervus terminalis is another  neural system in the nasal cavity.  Unlike
              the olfactory and  vomeronasal systems, however, little is known about the
              function  of this cranial nerve.  Dr. Wirsig-Wiechmann has shown that this 
              neural complex which extends into the brain contains  gonadotropin-releasing
              hormone, a hormone mediating many aspects  of reproduction.  Using a
              comparative approach combined with a  variety of state-of-the-art anatomical
              techniques, she will  determine the neuroanatomical organization of the nervus 
              terminalis and the corresponding distribution of receptors for  this hormone. 
              To examine its function, Dr. Wirsig-Wiechmann will  examine sensory and
              behavioral conditions that activate gene  expression in nervus terminalis
              neurons.  The results of these  studies will better define the
              interrelationship between sensory,  neurohormonal and behavioral systems.  It
              may lead to a more  thorough understanding of how the animals environment
              affects its  reproductive capabilities that are important for survival.     ***
