Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project UPDATE (Upgrading Practice through Design and                          
              Technology/Engineering Education) will develop K-8                             
              curriculum materials for teaching integrative mathematics,                     
              science and technology using a design, technology and                          
              problem-solving approach.  The project will have widespread                    
              impact on teachers, students and practitioners by providing                    
              twelve curriculum packages as models for (a) innovative                        
              instruction and (b) further curriculum development efforts                     
              of collaborative teams of teachers and practitioners from                      
              science, mathematics, engineering, design and technology.                      
              The inservice training of other teachers will be initiated                     
              regionally through participating teacher-training                              
              institutions as an initial step for national dissemination                     
              and training.  National dissemination of the models and                        
              materials will be accomplished mainly through TIES Magazine,                   
              a free periodical for teachers published by Drexel                             
              University.  The curriculum materials from Project UPDATE                      
              will support a national commitment to improve education in                     
              mathematics, science and technology by engaging students in                    
              using, discussing, assessing and reconstructing what they                      
              have learned as they continue to put their knowledge to                        
              work.
