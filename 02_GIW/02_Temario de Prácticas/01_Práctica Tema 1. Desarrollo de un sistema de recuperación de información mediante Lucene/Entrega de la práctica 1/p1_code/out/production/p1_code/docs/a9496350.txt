Abstract    :
              9307105  Cheng  Three cohesive experiments are proposed to study rhizosphere
              processes in natural soil conditions.  In the first experiment, root
              respiration, rhizosphere microbial respiration and root exudate composition
              will be measured via an isotopic trapping method under both gnotobiotic and
              natural soil conditions.  In the second experiment, the effect of soil faunal
              grazers on the assimilation efficiency of root exudates will be assessed using
              both an isotopic trapping and filter-out-grazers techniques.  In the third
              experiment, the proportion of rhizosphere microbial respiration from
              associative N2-fixation will be measured by an isotopic trapping plus soil
              nitrogen manipulation method.  %%%  Results from the first experiment will
              answer the question:  how relevant are values of rhizosphere measurements
              obtained from gnotobiotic conditions to the real soil environment?  Results
              from the second and the third experiments will be used to test the hypothesis
              that rhizosphere associative N2-fixation and faunal grazing of rhizosphere
              bacteria are two important biotic factors controlling the microbial
              assimilation efficiency of root exudates in situ.  Findings from this proposed
              research will not only enhance general understanding of rhizosphere processes,
              but also help to build a dimension of ecological reality to rhizosphere
              research.  N2=  Nitrogen
