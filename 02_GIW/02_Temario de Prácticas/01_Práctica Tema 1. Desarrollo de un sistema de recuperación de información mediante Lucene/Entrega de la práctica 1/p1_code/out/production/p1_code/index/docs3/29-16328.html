<h2><a href="#C.PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<div class="div2">
<p>
<span class="sc">The</span> present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern
measures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. <i>Approximately</i>, I repeat; for a very
close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be prose to
a modern ear.
</p>


<p>
The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally
a deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient
reason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while, however,
he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted from
the criticisms of other students of the poem.
</p>


<p>
This work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike
the translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he
hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of English
literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the most ancient
epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking; and yet there
must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow even a daring
guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of Hrothgar, of the
prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the hearts of our forefathers
in their primeval homes.
</p>


<p>
In order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been
used, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of the original,
permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.
</p>


<p>
Perhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf
should be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe
to be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold
to say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is justly called
our first <i>epic</i>? Of those translators who have used verse, several have written



<span class="pagenum" id="page_viii">[viii]</span>


from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it proper, for instance,
that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and Hrothgar be put in ballad
measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or, again, is it fitting that the
rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be interpreted to us in the smooth
measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear what has been beautifully called
&#8220;the clanging tread of a warrior in mail&#8221;?
</p>


<p>
Of all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone
gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great Teutonic
epic.
</p>


<p>
The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
reproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences closely
resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking poems. The
four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as much thesis and
anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular cadence. Alliteration has
been used to a large extent; but it was thought that modern ears would hardly
tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has been used occasionally; internal
rhyme, sporadically. Both have some warrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For
end-rhyme, see <a href="#L.I.53">1&#160;<span class="smaller">53</span></a>, <a href="#L.I.54">1&#160;<span class="smaller">54</span></a>; for internal rhyme, <a href="#L.II.21">2&#160;<span class="smaller">21</span></a>, <a href="#L.VI.40">6&#160;<span class="smaller">40</span></a>.)
</p>


<p>
What Gummere<sup class="footnoteref"><a href="#PREFACE.FNDEF.1" title="Handbook of Poetics, page 175, 1st edition." id="PREFACE.FNREF.1">1</a></sup> calls the &#8220;rime-giver&#8221; has been studiously kept; <i>viz.</i>, the
first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the alliteration;
and the last accented syllable alliterates only sporadically. Alternate alliteration
is occasionally used as in the original. (See <a href="#L.VII.61">7&#160;<span class="smaller">61</span></a>, <a href="#L.VIII.5">8&#160;<span class="smaller">5</span></a>.)
</p>


<p>
No two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally
after a cæsural pause. (See <a href="#L.II.19">2&#160;<span class="smaller">19</span></a> and <a href="#L.XII.1">12&#160;<span class="smaller">1</span></a>.)
Or, scientifically speaking, Sievers&#8217;s
C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of translation. Several
of his types, however, constantly occur; <i>e.g.</i> A and a variant
(/&#160;x | /&#160;x) (/&#160;x&#160;x | /&#160;x);
B and a variant (x&#160;/ | x&#160;/&#160;) (x&#160;x&#160;/ | x&#160;/&#160;); a variant of D (/&#160;x | /&#160;x&#160;x);
E (/&#160;x&#160;x | /&#160;). Anacrusis gives further variety to the types used in the translation.
</p>


<p>
The parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (<i>E.g.</i>, <a href="#L.I.16">1&#160;<span class="smaller">16</span></a>
and <a href="#L.I.17">1&#160;<span class="smaller">17</span></a>: &#8220;Lord&#8221; and &#8220;Wielder of Glory&#8221;; <a href="#L.I.30">1&#160;<span class="smaller">30</span></a>, <a href="#L.I.31">1&#160;<span class="smaller">31</span></a>, <a href="#L.I.32">1&#160;<span class="smaller">32</span></a>; <a href="#L.II.12">2&#160;<span class="smaller">12</span></a> and <a href="#L.II.13">2&#160;<span class="smaller">13</span></a>;
<a href="#L.II.27">2&#160;<span class="smaller">27</span></a> and <a href="#L.II.28">2&#160;<span class="smaller">28</span></a>; <a href="#L.III.5">3&#160;<span class="smaller">5</span></a> and <a href="#L.III.6">3&#160;<span class="smaller">6</span></a>.) Occasionally, some loss has been sustained; but,
on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.
</p>


<p>
The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the translation.
All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have been


<span class="pagenum" id="page_ix">[ix]</span>


avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are none,
it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.
</p>


<p>
With these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of

<h2><i>THE STORY.</i></h2>

<p>
<i>Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or
palace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents. The
joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the monster,
is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of joyance that
reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and anon he goes to
the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after thane is ruthlessly
carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong enough and bold enough
to cope with the monster. For twelve years he persecutes Hrothgar and his
vassals.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>Over sea, a day&#8217;s voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,
king of the Geats, hears of Grendel&#8217;s doings and of Hrothgar&#8217;s misery. He
resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With fourteen
chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that country, he soon
persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours that elapse before
night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When Hrothgar&#8217;s bedtime
comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling him that never before has
he given to another the absolute wardship of his palace. All retire to rest,
Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God&#8217;s anger. He seizes
and kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.
A fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used, both
combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears Grendel&#8217;s
shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den, howling and
yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall
Heorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and
his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>Grendel&#8217;s mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She
is furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart



<span class="pagenum" id="page_x">[x]</span>


from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar&#8217;s favorite
counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is called. Determined
to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and goes down to look
for the female monster. After traveling through the waters many hours, he
meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her den. There he sees
Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal struggle with the
woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking with him Grendel&#8217;s
head.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor.
Hrothgar literally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed
among the vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a distinguished
guest. He is the hero of the hour.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he
has been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried by a
fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing struggle
both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is inexpressible.
They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor the memory
of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is burnt. Then a
memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that sailors afar may
be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national hero of Geatland.</i>
</p>


<p>
<i>The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness, his
goodness of heart, and his generosity.</i>

<p>
It is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the story
of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that of the Iliad.
Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history of the life of the
Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our forefathers of pre-Alfredian
eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of adventure.
</p>

My special thanks are due to Professors Francis A. March and James A.
Harrison, for advice, sympathy, and assistance.

&#8216;continually,&#8217; not always &#8216;often.&#8217;&#8212;Why &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">an (on) wíg gearwe</span>&#8217; should be

occurs quite frequently with &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">on</span>&#8217;; cf. B. 1110 (<i>ready for the pyre</i>), El. 222
(<i>ready for the glad journey</i>). Moreover, what has the idea of single combat
to do with B. 1247 ff.? The poet is giving an inventory of the arms and
armor which they lay aside on retiring, and he closes his narration by saying
that they were <i>always prepared for battle both at home and on the march</i>.

<a href="#XXIV.FNREF.1">[1]</a>&#160;&#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Þæs monige gewearð</span>&#8217; (1599) and &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hafað þæs geworden</span>&#8217; (2027).&#8212;In a
paper published some years ago in one of the Johns Hopkins University
circulars, I tried to throw upon these two long-doubtful passages some light
derived from a study of like passages in Alfred&#8217;s prose.&#8212;The impersonal verb
&#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geweorðan</span>,&#8217; with an accus. of the person, and a <span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæt</span>-clause is used several
times with the meaning &#8216;agree.&#8217; See Orosius (Sweet&#8217;s ed.) 178<sub>7</sub>; 204<sub>34</sub>;
208<sub>28</sub>; 210<sub>15</sub>; 280<sub>20</sub>. In the two Beowulf passages, the <span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæt</span>-clause is anticipated
by &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæs</span>,&#8217; which is clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.

<p>
The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: <i>Then many
agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him</i>.
</p>


<p>
The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): <i>She is promised &#8230;; to this the
friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc</i>. By emending &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">is</span>&#8217; instead of &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wæs</span>&#8217;
(2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.
</p>


<p>
In v. 1997 ff. this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.&#8217;s great
article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my reading
of 1599 and 2027. Translate 1997 then: <i>Wouldst let the South-Danes themselves
decide about their struggle with Grendel</i>. Here &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Súð-Dene</span>&#8217; is accus.
of person, and &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gúðe</span>&#8217; is gen. of thing agreed on.
</p>


<p>
With such collateral support as that afforded by B. (P. and B. XII. 97), I
have no hesitation in departing from H.-So., my usual guide.
</p>


<p>
The idiom above treated runs through A.-S., Old Saxon, and other Teutonic
languages, and should be noticed in the lexicons.

but the translator here departs from his editor by understanding the poet to
refer to a hypothetical old man, introduced as an illustration of a father&#8217;s
sorrow.

<p>
Hrethrel had certainly never seen a son of his ride on the gallows to feed
the crows.

<p>
The passage beginning &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">swá bið géomorlic</span>&#8217; seems to be an effort to reach
a full simile, &#8216;as &#8230; so.&#8217; &#8216;As it is mournful for an old man, etc. &#8230; so the
defence of the Weders (2463) bore heart-sorrow, etc.&#8217; The verses 2451 to
2463½ would be parenthetical, the poet&#8217;s feelings being so strong as to interrupt
the simile. The punctuation of the fourth edition would be better&#8212;a
comma after &#8216;<span class="ang" lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">galgan</span>&#8217; (2447). The translation may be indicated as follows:
<i>(Just) as it is sad for an old man to see his son ride young on the gallows when
he himself is uttering mournful measures, a sorrowful song, while his son hangs
for a comfort to the raven, and he, old and infirm, cannot render him any
kelp&#8212;(he is constantly reminded, etc., 2451-2463)&#8212;so the defence of the

American editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I
hope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall into
the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems best
to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
