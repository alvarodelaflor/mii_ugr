    <h2>
      I. The Arrest of Arsène Lupin
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a strange ending to a voyage that had commenced in a most
      auspicious manner. The transatlantic steamship &lsquo;La Provence&rsquo; was a swift
      and comfortable vessel, under the command of a most affable man. The
      passengers constituted a select and delightful society. The charm of new
      acquaintances and improvised amusements served to make the time pass
      agreeably. We enjoyed the pleasant sensation of being separated from the
      world, living, as it were, upon an unknown island, and consequently
      obliged to be sociable with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever stopped to consider how much originality and spontaneity
      emanate from these various individuals who, on the preceding evening, did
      not even know each other, and who are now, for several days, condemned to
      lead a life of extreme intimacy, jointly defying the anger of the ocean,
      the terrible onslaught of the waves, the violence of the tempest and the
      agonizing monotony of the calm and sleepy water? Such a life becomes a
      sort of tragic existence, with its storms and its grandeurs, its monotony
      and its diversity; and that is why, perhaps, we embark upon that short
      voyage with mingled feelings of pleasure and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, during the past few years, a new sensation had been added to the life
      of the transatlantic traveler. The little floating island is now attached
      to the world from which it was once quite free. A bond united them, even
      in the very heart of the watery wastes of the Atlantic. That bond is the
      wireless telegraph, by means of which we receive news in the most
      mysterious manner. We know full well that the message is not transported
      by the medium of a hollow wire. No, the mystery is even more inexplicable,
      more romantic, and we must have recourse to the wings of the air in order
      to explain this new miracle. During the first day of the voyage, we felt
      that we were being followed, escorted, preceded even, by that distant
      voice, which, from time to time, whispered to one of us a few words from
      the receding world. Two friends spoke to me. Ten, twenty others sent gay
      or somber words of parting to other passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day, at a distance of five hundred miles from the French
      coast, in the midst of a violent storm, we received the following message
      by means of the wireless telegraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin is on your vessel, first cabin, blonde hair, wound right
      fore-arm, traveling alone under name of R........&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, a terrible flash of lightning rent the stormy skies. The
      electric waves were interrupted. The remainder of the dispatch never
      reached us. Of the name under which Arsène Lupin was concealing himself,
      we knew only the initial.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the news had been of some other character, I have no doubt that the
      secret would have been carefully guarded by the telegraphic operator as
      well as by the officers of the vessel. But it was one of those events
      calculated to escape from the most rigorous discretion. The same day, no
      one knew how, the incident became a matter of current gossip and every
      passenger was aware that the famous Arsène Lupin was hiding in our midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin in our midst! the irresponsible burglar whose exploits had
      been narrated in all the newspapers during the past few months! the
      mysterious individual with whom Ganimard, our shrewdest detective, had
      been engaged in an implacable conflict amidst interesting and picturesque
      surroundings. Arsène Lupin, the eccentric gentleman who operates only in
      the châteaux and salons, and who, one night, entered the residence of
      Baron Schormann, but emerged empty-handed, leaving, however, his card on
      which he had scribbled these words: &ldquo;Arsène Lupin, gentleman-burglar, will
      return when the furniture is genuine.&rdquo; Arsène Lupin, the man of a thousand
      disguises: in turn a chauffer, detective, bookmaker, Russian physician,
      Spanish bull-fighter, commercial traveler, robust youth, or decrepit old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then consider this startling situation: Arsène Lupin was wandering about
      within the limited bounds of a transatlantic steamer; in that very small
      corner of the world, in that dining saloon, in that smoking room, in that
      music room! Arsène Lupin was, perhaps, this gentleman.... or that one....
      my neighbor at the table.... the sharer of my stateroom....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this condition of affairs will last for five days!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
      Nelly Underdown, next morning. &ldquo;It is unbearable! I hope he will be
      arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing me, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Monsieur d&rsquo;Andrézy, you are on intimate terms with the captain;
      surely you know something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I should have been delighted had I possessed any information that would
      interest Miss Nelly. She was one of those magnificent creatures who
      inevitably attract attention in every assembly. Wealth and beauty form an
      irresistible combination, and Nelly possessed both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Educated in Paris under the care of a French mother, she was now going to
      visit her father, the millionaire Underdown of Chicago. She was
      accompanied by one of her friends, Lady Jerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I had decided to open a flirtation with her; but, in the rapidly
      growing intimacy of the voyage, I was soon impressed by her charming
      manner and my feelings became too deep and reverential for a mere
      flirtation. Moreover, she accepted my attentions with a certain degree of
      favor. She condescended to laugh at my witticisms and display an interest
      in my stories. Yet I felt that I had a rival in the person of a young man
      with quiet and refined tastes; and it struck me, at times, that she
      preferred his taciturn humor to my Parisian frivolity. He formed one in
      the circle of admirers that surrounded Miss Nelly at the time she
      addressed to me the foregoing question. We were all comfortably seated in
      our deck-chairs. The storm of the preceding evening had cleared the sky.
      The weather was now delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no definite knowledge, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but can not we,
      ourselves, investigate the mystery quite as well as the detective
      Ganimard, the personal enemy of Arsène Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! you are progressing very fast, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, mademoiselle. In the first place, let me ask, do you find the
      problem a complicated one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very complicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten the key we hold for the solution to the problem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, Lupin calls himself Monsieur R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather vague information,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secondly, he is traveling alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that help you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirdly, he is blonde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we have only to peruse the passenger-list, and proceed by process of
      elimination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had that list in my pocket. I took it out and glanced through it. Then I
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find that there are only thirteen men on the passenger-list whose names
      begin with the letter R.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only thirteen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in the first cabin. And of those thirteen, I find that nine of them
      are accompanied by women, children or servants. That leaves only four who
      are traveling alone. First, the Marquis de Raverdan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secretary to the American Ambassador,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Nelly. &ldquo;I know
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Rawson,&rdquo; I continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my uncle,&rdquo; some one said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon. Rivolta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; exclaimed an Italian, whose face was concealed beneath a heavy
      black beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nelly burst into laughter, and exclaimed: &ldquo;That gentleman can
      scarcely be called a blonde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we are forced to the conclusion that the
      guilty party is the last one on the list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon. Rozaine. Does anyone know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one answered. But Miss Nelly turned to the taciturn young man, whose
      attentions to her had annoyed me, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur Rozaine, why do you not answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were now turned upon him. He was a blonde. I must confess that I
      myself felt a shock of surprise, and the profound silence that followed
      her question indicated that the others present also viewed the situation
      with a feeling of sudden alarm. However, the idea was an absurd one,
      because the gentleman in question presented an air of the most perfect
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I not answer?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because, considering my name, my position
      as a solitary traveler and the color of my hair, I have already reached
      the same conclusion, and now think that I should be arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He presented a strange appearance as he uttered these words. His thin lips
      were drawn closer than usual and his face was ghastly pale, whilst his
      eyes were streaked with blood. Of course, he was joking, yet his
      appearance and attitude impressed us strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not the wound?&rdquo; said Miss Nelly, naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I lack the wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he pulled up his sleeve, removing his cuff, and showed us his arm.
      But that action did not deceive me. He had shown us his left arm, and I
      was on the point of calling his attention to the fact, when another
      incident diverted our attention. Lady Jerland, Miss Nelly&rsquo;s friend, came
      running towards us in a state of great excitement, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jewels, my pearls! Some one has stolen them all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, they were not all gone, as we soon found out. The thief had taken only
      part of them; a very curious thing. Of the diamond sunbursts, jeweled
      pendants, bracelets and necklaces, the thief had taken, not the largest
      but the finest and most valuable stones. The mountings were lying upon the
      table. I saw them there, despoiled of their jewels, like flowers from
      which the beautiful colored petals had been ruthlessly plucked. And this
      theft must have been committed at the time Lady Jerland was taking her
      tea; in broad daylight, in a stateroom opening on a much frequented
      corridor; moreover, the thief had been obliged to force open the door of
      the stateroom, search for the jewel-case, which was hidden at the bottom
      of a hat-box, open it, select his booty and remove it from the mountings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, all the passengers instantly reached the same conclusion; it
      was the work of Arsène Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day, at the dinner table, the seats to the right and left of Rozaine
      remained vacant; and, during the evening, it was rumored that the captain
      had placed him under arrest, which information produced a feeling of
      safety and relief. We breathed once more. That evening, we resumed our
      games and dances. Miss Nelly, especially, displayed a spirit of
      thoughtless gayety which convinced me that if Rozaine&rsquo;s attentions had
      been agreeable to her in the beginning, she had already forgotten them.
      Her charm and good-humor completed my conquest. At midnight, under a
      bright moon, I declared my devotion with an ardor that did not seem to
      displease her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, next day, to our general amazement, Rozaine was at liberty. We
      learned that the evidence against him was not sufficient. He had produced
      documents that were perfectly regular, which showed that he was the son of
      a wealthy merchant of Bordeaux. Besides, his arms did not bear the
      slightest trace of a wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Documents! Certificates of birth!&rdquo; exclaimed the enemies of Rozaine, &ldquo;of
      course, Arsène Lupin will furnish you as many as you desire. And as to the
      wound, he never had it, or he has removed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was proven that, at the time of the theft, Rozaine was promenading
      on the deck. To which fact, his enemies replied that a man like Arsène
      Lupin could commit a crime without being actually present. And then, apart
      from all other circumstances, there remained one point which even the most
      skeptical could not answer: Who except Rozaine, was traveling alone, was a
      blonde, and bore a name beginning with R? To whom did the telegram point,
      if it were not Rozaine?
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Rozaine, a few minutes before breakfast, came boldly toward our
      group, Miss Nelly and Lady Jerland arose and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, a manuscript circular was passed from hand to hand amongst
      the sailors, the stewards, and the passengers of all classes. It announced
      that Mon. Louis Rozaine offered a reward of ten thousand francs for the
      discovery of Arsène Lupin or other person in possession of the stolen
      jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if no one assists me, I will unmask the scoundrel myself,&rdquo; declared
      Rozaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rozaine against Arsène Lupin, or rather, according to current opinion,
      Arsène Lupin himself against Arsène Lupin; the contest promised to be
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing developed during the next two days. We saw Rozaine wandering
      about, day and night, searching, questioning, investigating. The captain,
      also, displayed commendable activity. He caused the vessel to be searched
      from stem to stern; ransacked every stateroom under the plausible theory
      that the jewels might be concealed anywhere, except in the thief&rsquo;s own
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they will find out something soon,&rdquo; remarked Miss Nelly to me.
      &ldquo;He may be a wizard, but he cannot make diamonds and pearls become
      invisible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but he should examine the lining of our hats
      and vests and everything we carry with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, exhibiting my Kodak, a 9x12 with which I had been photographing her
      in various poses, I added: &ldquo;In an apparatus no larger than that, a person
      could hide all of Lady Jerland&rsquo;s jewels. He could pretend to take pictures
      and no one would suspect the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have heard it said that every thief leaves some clue behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be generally true,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but there is one exception:
      Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he concentrates his thoughts not only on the theft, but on all
      the circumstances connected with it that could serve as a clue to his
      identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few days ago, you were more confident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but since then I have seen him at work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think about it now?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in my opinion, we are wasting our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as a matter of fact, the investigation had produced no result. But,
      in the meantime, the captain&rsquo;s watch had been stolen. He was furious. He
      quickened his efforts and watched Rozaine more closely than before. But,
      on the following day, the watch was found in the second officer&rsquo;s collar
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident caused considerable astonishment, and displayed the humorous
      side of Arsène Lupin, burglar though he was, but dilettante as well. He
      combined business with pleasure. He reminded us of the author who almost
      died in a fit of laughter provoked by his own play. Certainly, he was an
      artist in his particular line of work, and whenever I saw Rozaine, gloomy
      and reserved, and thought of the double role that he was playing, I
      accorded him a certain measure of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following evening, the officer on deck duty heard groans emanating
      from the darkest corner of the ship. He approached and found a man lying
      there, his head enveloped in a thick gray scarf and his hands tied
      together with a heavy cord. It was Rozaine. He had been assaulted, thrown
      down and robbed. A card, pinned to his coat, bore these words: &ldquo;Arsène
      Lupin accepts with pleasure the ten thousand francs offered by Mon.
      Rozaine.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, the stolen pocket-book contained twenty
      thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, some accused the unfortunate man of having simulated this
      attack on himself. But, apart from the fact that he could not have bound
      himself in that manner, it was established that the writing on the card
      was entirely different from that of Rozaine, but, on the contrary,
      resembled the handwriting of Arsène Lupin as it was reproduced in an old
      newspaper found on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it appeared that Rozaine was not Arsène Lupin; but was Rozaine, the
      son of a Bordeaux merchant. And the presence of Arsène Lupin was once more
      affirmed, and that in a most alarming manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of terror amongst the passengers that none would remain
      alone in a stateroom or wander singly in unfrequented parts of the vessel.
      We clung together as a matter of safety. And yet the most intimate
      acquaintances were estranged by a mutual feeling of distrust. Arsène Lupin
      was, now, anybody and everybody. Our excited imaginations attributed to
      him miraculous and unlimited power. We supposed him capable of assuming
      the most unexpected disguises; of being, by turns, the highly respectable
      Major Rawson or the noble Marquis de Raverdan, or even&mdash;for we no
      longer stopped with the accusing letter of R&mdash;or even such or such a
      person well known to all of us, and having wife, children and servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first wireless dispatches from America brought no news; at least, the
      captain did not communicate any to us. The silence was not reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last day on the steamer seemed interminable. We lived in constant fear
      of some disaster. This time, it would not be a simple theft or a
      comparatively harmless assault; it would be a crime, a murder. No one
      imagined that Arsène Lupin would confine himself to those two trifling
      offenses. Absolute master of the ship, the authorities powerless, he could
      do whatever he pleased; our property and lives were at his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet those were delightful hours for me, since they secured to me the
      confidence of Miss Nelly. Deeply moved by those startling events and being
      of a highly nervous nature, she spontaneously sought at my side a
      protection and security that I was pleased to give her. Inwardly, I
      blessed Arsène Lupin. Had he not been the means of bringing me and Miss
      Nelly closer to each other? Thanks to him, I could now indulge in
      delicious dreams of love and happiness&mdash;dreams that, I felt, were not
      unwelcome to Miss Nelly. Her smiling eyes authorized me to make them; the
      softness of her voice bade me hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached the American shore, the active search for the thief was
      apparently abandoned, and we were anxiously awaiting the supreme moment in
      which the mysterious enigma would be explained. Who was Arsène Lupin?
      Under what name, under what disguise was the famous Arsène Lupin
      concealing himself? And, at last, that supreme moment arrived. If I live
      one hundred years, I shall not forget the slightest details of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pale you are, Miss Nelly,&rdquo; I said to my companion, as she leaned upon
      my arm, almost fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you!&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;ah! you are so changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think! this is a most exciting moment, and I am delighted to spend
      it with you, Miss Nelly. I hope that your memory will sometimes revert&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was not listening. She was nervous and excited. The gangway was
      placed in position, but, before we could use it, the uniformed customs
      officers came on board. Miss Nelly murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear that Arsène Lupin escaped from the
      vessel during the voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he preferred death to dishonor, and plunged into the Atlantic
      rather than be arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not laugh,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I started, and, in answer to her question, I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that little old man standing at the bottom of the gangway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an umbrella and an olive-green coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Ganimard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganimard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the celebrated detective who has sworn to capture Arsène Lupin. Ah!
      I can understand now why we did not receive any news from this side of the
      Atlantic. Ganimard was here! and he always keeps his business secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think he will arrest Arsène Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell? The unexpected always happens when Arsène Lupin is
      concerned in the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with that morbid curiosity peculiar to women, &ldquo;I
      should like to see him arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to be patient. No doubt, Arsène Lupin has already seen his
      enemy and will not be in a hurry to leave the steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The passengers were now leaving the steamer. Leaning on his umbrella, with
      an air of careless indifference, Ganimard appeared to be paying no
      attention to the crowd that was hurrying down the gangway. The Marquis de
      Raverdan, Major Rawson, the Italian Rivolta, and many others had already
      left the vessel before Rozaine appeared. Poor Rozaine!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is he, after all,&rdquo; said Miss Nelly to me. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be very interesting to have Ganimard and Rozaine in the
      same picture. You take the camera. I am loaded down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave her the camera, but too late for her to use it. Rozaine was already
      passing the detective. An American officer, standing behind Ganimard,
      leaned forward and whispered in his ear. The French detective shrugged his
      shoulders and Rozaine passed on. Then, my God, who was Arsène Lupin?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Nelly, aloud, &ldquo;who can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not more than twenty people now remained on board. She scrutinized them
      one by one, fearful that Arsène Lupin was not amongst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot wait much longer,&rdquo; I said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started toward the gangway. I followed. But we had not taken ten steps
      when Ganimard barred our passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, monsieur. What&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am escorting mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he repeated, in a tone of authority. Then, gazing into my
      eyes, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and replied: &ldquo;No, simply Bernard d&rsquo;Andrézy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernard d&rsquo;Andrézy died in Macedonia three years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Bernard d&rsquo;Andrézy were dead, I should not be here. But you are
      mistaken. Here are my papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are his; and I can tell you exactly how they came into your
      possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Arsène Lupin sailed under the name of R&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, another of your tricks; a false scent that deceived them at Havre.
      You play a good game, my boy, but this time luck is against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated a moment. Then he hit me a sharp blow on the right arm, which
      caused me to utter a cry of pain. He had struck the wound, yet unhealed,
      referred to in the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to surrender. There was no alternative. I turned to Miss
      Nelly, who had heard everything. Our eyes met; then she glanced at the
      Kodak I had placed in her hands, and made a gesture that conveyed to me
      the impression that she understood everything. Yes, there, between the
      narrow folds of black leather, in the hollow centre of the small object
      that I had taken the precaution to place in her hands before Ganimard
      arrested me, it was there I had deposited Rozaine&rsquo;s twenty thousand francs
      and Lady Jerland&rsquo;s pearls and diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! I pledge my oath that, at that solemn moment, when I was in the grasp
      of Ganimard and his two assistants, I was perfectly indifferent to
      everything, to my arrest, the hostility of the people, everything except
      this one question: what will Miss Nelly do with the things I had confided
      to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the absence of that material and conclusive proof, I had nothing to
      fear; but would Miss Nelly decide to furnish that proof? Would she betray
      me? Would she act the part of an enemy who cannot forgive, or that of a
      woman whose scorn is softened by feelings of indulgence and involuntary
      sympathy?
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed in front of me. I said nothing, but bowed very low. Mingled
      with the other passengers, she advanced to the gangway with my Kodak in
      her hand. It occurred to me that she would not dare to expose me publicly,
      but she might do so when she reached a more private place. However, when
      she had passed only a few feet down the gangway, with a movement of
      simulated awkwardness, she let the camera fall into the water between the
      vessel and the pier. Then she walked down the gangway, and was quickly
      lost to sight in the crowd. She had passed out of my life forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, I stood motionless. Then, to Ganimard&rsquo;s great astonishment,
      I muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity that I am not an honest man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the story of his arrest as narrated to me by Arsène Lupin
      himself. The various incidents, which I shall record in writing at a later
      day, have established between us certain ties.... shall I say of
      friendship? Yes, I venture to believe that Arsène Lupin honors me with his
      friendship, and that it is through friendship that he occasionally calls
      on me, and brings, into the silence of my library, his youthful exuberance
      of spirits, the contagion of his enthusiasm, and the mirth of a man for
      whom destiny has naught but favors and smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      His portrait? How can I describe him? I have seen him twenty times and
      each time he was a different person; even he himself said to me on one
      occasion: &ldquo;I no longer know who I am. I cannot recognize myself in the
      mirror.&rdquo; Certainly, he was a great actor, and possessed a marvelous
      faculty for disguising himself. Without the slightest effort, he could
      adopt the voice, gestures and mannerisms of another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why should I retain a definite form and feature? Why not
      avoid the danger of a personality that is ever the same? My actions will
      serve to identify me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he added, with a touch of pride:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better if no one can ever say with absolute certainty: There
      is Arsène Lupin! The essential point is that the public may be able to
      refer to my work and say, without fear of mistake: Arsène Lupin did that!&rdquo;

      II. Arsène Lupin in Prison
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no tourist worthy of the name who does not know the banks of the
      Seine, and has not noticed, in passing, the little feudal castle of the
      Malaquis, built upon a rock in the centre of the river. An arched bridge
      connects it with the shore. All around it, the calm waters of the great
      river play peacefully amongst the reeds, and the wagtails flutter over the
      moist crests of the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Malaquis castle is stormy like its name, harsh like its
      outlines. It has passed through a long series of combats, sieges,
      assaults, rapines and massacres. A recital of the crimes that have been
      committed there would cause the stoutest heart to tremble. There are many
      mysterious legends connected with the castle, and they tell us of a famous
      subterranean tunnel that formerly led to the abbey of Jumieges and to the
      manor of Agnes Sorel, mistress of Charles VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that ancient habitation of heroes and brigands, the Baron Nathan Cahorn
      now lived; or Baron Satan as he was formerly called on the Bourse, where
      he had acquired a fortune with incredible rapidity. The lords of Malaquis,
      absolutely ruined, had been obliged to sell the ancient castle at a great
      sacrifice. It contained an admirable collection of furniture, pictures,
      wood carvings, and faience. The Baron lived there alone, attended by three
      old servants. No one ever enters the place. No one had ever beheld the
      three Rubens that he possessed, his two Watteau, his Jean Goujon pulpit,
      and the many other treasures that he had acquired by a vast expenditure of
      money at public sales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baron Satan lived in constant fear, not for himself, but for the treasures
      that he had accumulated with such an earnest devotion and with so much
      perspicacity that the shrewdest merchant could not say that the Baron had
      ever erred in his taste or judgment. He loved them&mdash;his bibelots. He
      loved them intensely, like a miser; jealously, like a lover. Every day, at
      sunset, the iron gates at either end of the bridge and at the entrance to
      the court of honor are closed and barred. At the least touch on these
      gates, electric bells will ring throughout the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Thursday in September, a letter-carrier presented himself at the gate
      at the head of the bridge, and, as usual, it was the Baron himself who
      partially opened the heavy portal. He scrutinized the man as minutely as
      if he were a stranger, although the honest face and twinkling eyes of the
      postman had been familiar to the Baron for many years. The man laughed, as
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only I, Monsieur le Baron. It is not another man wearing my cap and
      blouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can never tell,&rdquo; muttered the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man handed him a number of newspapers, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Monsieur le Baron, here is something new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a letter. A registered letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Living as a recluse, without friends or business relations, the baron
      never received any letters, and the one now presented to him immediately
      aroused within him a feeling of suspicion and distrust. It was like an
      evil omen. Who was this mysterious correspondent that dared to disturb the
      tranquility of his retreat?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must sign for it, Monsieur le Baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He signed; then took the letter, waited until the postman had disappeared
      beyond the bend in the road, and, after walking nervously to and fro for a
      few minutes, he leaned against the parapet of the bridge and opened the
      envelope. It contained a sheet of paper, bearing this heading: Prison de
      la Santé, Paris. He looked at the signature: Arsène Lupin. Then he read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Monsieur le Baron:

  &ldquo;There is, in the gallery in your castle, a picture of Philippe
  de Champaigne, of exquisite finish, which pleases me beyond
  measure.  Your Rubens are also to my taste, as well as your
  smallest Watteau.  In the salon to the right, I have noticed the
  Louis XIII cadence-table, the tapestries of Beauvais, the Empire
  gueridon signed &lsquo;Jacob,&rsquo; and the Renaissance chest.  In the salon
  to the left, all the cabinet full of jewels and miniatures.

  &ldquo;For the present, I will content myself with those articles that
  can be conveniently removed.  I will therefore ask you to pack
  them carefully and ship them to me, charges prepaid, to the
  station at Batignolles, within eight days, otherwise I shall be
  obliged to remove them myself during the night of 27 September;
  but, under those circumstances, I shall not content myself with
  the articles above mentioned.

  &ldquo;Accept my apologies for any inconvenience I may cause you, and
  believe me to be your humble servant,

                                            &ldquo;Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;

  &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;Please do not send the largest Watteau.  Although you
  paid thirty thousand francs for it, it is only a copy, the
  original having been burned, under the Directoire by Barras,
  during a night of debauchery.  Consult the memoirs of Garat.

  &ldquo;I do not care for the Louis XV chatelaine, as I doubt its
  authenticity.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That letter completely upset the baron. Had it borne any other signature,
      he would have been greatly alarmed&mdash;but signed by Arsène Lupin!
    </p>
    <p>
      As an habitual reader of the newspapers, he was versed in the history of
      recent crimes, and was therefore well acquainted with the exploits of the
      mysterious burglar. Of course, he knew that Lupin had been arrested in
      America by his enemy Ganimard and was at present incarcerated in the
      Prison de la Santé. But he knew also that any miracle might be expected
      from Arsène Lupin. Moreover, that exact knowledge of the castle, the
      location of the pictures and furniture, gave the affair an alarming
      aspect. How could he have acquired that information concerning things that
      no one had ever seen?
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron raised his eyes and contemplated the stern outlines of the
      castle, its steep rocky pedestal, the depth of the surrounding water, and
      shrugged his shoulders. Certainly, there was no danger. No one in the
      world could force an entrance to the sanctuary that contained his
      priceless treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, perhaps, but Arsène Lupin! For him, gates, walls and drawbridges
      did not exist. What use were the most formidable obstacles or the most
      careful precautions, if Arsène Lupin had decided to effect an entrance?
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, he wrote to the Procurer of the Republique at Rouen. He
      enclosed the threatening letter and solicited aid and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply came at once to the effect that Arsène Lupin was in custody in
      the Prison de la Santé, under close surveillance, with no opportunity to
      write such a letter, which was, no doubt, the work of some imposter. But,
      as an act of precaution, the Procurer had submitted the letter to an
      expert in handwriting, who declared that, in spite of certain
      resemblances, the writing was not that of the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the words &ldquo;in spite of certain resemblances&rdquo; caught the attention of
      the baron; in them, he read the possibility of a doubt which appeared to
      him quite sufficient to warrant the intervention of the law. His fears
      increased. He read Lupin&rsquo;s letter over and over again. &ldquo;I shall be obliged
      to remove them myself.&rdquo; And then there was the fixed date: the night of 27
      September.
    </p>
    <p>
      To confide in his servants was a proceeding repugnant to his nature; but
      now, for the first time in many years, he experienced the necessity of
      seeking counsel with some one. Abandoned by the legal official of his own
      district, and feeling unable to defend himself with his own resources, he
      was on the point of going to Paris to engage the services of a detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days passed; on the third day, he was filled with hope and joy as he
      read the following item in the &lsquo;Réveil de Caudebec&rsquo;, a newspaper published
      in a neighboring town:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have the pleasure of entertaining in our city, at the present time,
      the veteran detective Mon. Ganimard who acquired a world-wide reputation
      by his clever capture of Arsène Lupin. He has come here for rest and
      recreation, and, being an enthusiastic fisherman, he threatens to capture
      all the fish in our river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard! Ah, here is the assistance desired by Baron Cahorn! Who could
      baffle the schemes of Arsène Lupin better than Ganimard, the patient and
      astute detective? He was the man for the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron did not hesitate. The town of Caudebec was only six kilometers
      from the castle, a short distance to a man whose step was accelerated by
      the hope of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several fruitless attempts to ascertain the detective&rsquo;s address, the
      baron visited the office of the &lsquo;Réveil,&rsquo; situated on the quai. There he
      found the writer of the article who, approaching the window, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganimard? Why, you are sure to see him somewhere on the quai with his
      fishing-pole. I met him there and chanced to read his name engraved on his
      rod. Ah, there he is now, under the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little man, wearing a straw hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. He is a gruff fellow, with little to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, the baron approached the celebrated Ganimard,
      introduced himself, and sought to commence a conversation, but that was a
      failure. Then he broached the real object of his interview, and briefly
      stated his case. The other listened, motionless, with his attention
      riveted on his fishing-rod. When the baron had finished his story, the
      fisherman turned, with an air of profound pity, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is not customary for thieves to warn people they are about
      to rob. Arsène Lupin, especially, would not commit such a folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, if I had the least doubt, believe me, the pleasure of again
      capturing Arsène Lupin would place me at your disposal. But,
      unfortunately, that young man is already under lock and key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have escaped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever escaped from the Santé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, he&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, no more than any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he escapes, so much the better. I will catch him again.
      Meanwhile, you go home and sleep soundly. That will do for the present.
      You frighten the fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was ended. The baron returned to the castle, reassured to
      some extent by Ganimard&rsquo;s indifference. He examined the bolts, watched the
      servants, and, during the next forty-eight hours, he became almost
      persuaded that his fears were groundless. Certainly, as Ganimard had said,
      thieves do not warn people they are about to rob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fateful day was close at hand. It was now the twenty-sixth of
      September and nothing had happened. But at three o&rsquo;clock the bell rang. A
      boy brought this telegram:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No goods at Batignolles station. Prepare everything for tomorrow night.
      Arsène.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This telegram threw the baron into such a state of excitement that he even
      considered the advisability of yielding to Lupin&rsquo;s demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he hastened to Caudebec. Ganimard was fishing at the same place,
      seated on a campstool. Without a word, he handed him the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; said the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? But it is tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The robbery! The pillage of my collections!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard laid down his fishing-rod, turned to the baron, and exclaimed, in
      a tone of impatience:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Do you think I am going to bother myself about such a silly story as
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you ask to pass tomorrow night in the castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sou. Now, leave me alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name your own price. I am rich and can pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This offer disconcerted Ganimard, who replied, calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here on a vacation. I have no right to undertake such work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one will know. I promise to keep it secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! three thousand francs. Will that be enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But I must warn you that you are throwing your money out of
      the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case... but, after all, what do we know about this devil Lupin!
      He may have quite a numerous band of robbers with him. Are you sure of
      your servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not count on them. I will telegraph for two of my men to help me.
      And now, go! It is better for us not to be seen together. Tomorrow evening
      about nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The following day&mdash;the date fixed by Arsène Lupin&mdash;Baron Cahorn
      arranged all his panoply of war, furbished his weapons, and, like a
      sentinel, paced to and fro in front of the castle. He saw nothing, heard
      nothing. At half-past eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, he dismissed his
      servants. They occupied rooms in a wing of the building, in a retired
      spot, well removed from the main portion of the castle. Shortly
      thereafter, the baron heard the sound of approaching footsteps. It was
      Ganimard and his two assistants&mdash;great, powerful fellows with immense
      hands, and necks like bulls. After asking a few questions relating to the
      location of the various entrances and rooms, Ganimard carefully closed and
      barricaded all the doors and windows through which one could gain access
      to the threatened rooms. He inspected the walls, raised the tapestries,
      and finally installed his assistants in the central gallery which was
      located between the two salons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No nonsense! We are not here to sleep. At the slightest sound, open the
      windows of the court and call me. Pay attention also to the water-side.
      Ten metres of perpendicular rock is no obstacle to those devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard locked his assistants in the gallery, carried away the keys, and
      said to the baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, to our post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had chosen for himself a small room located in the thick outer wall,
      between the two principal doors, and which, in former years, had been the
      watchman&rsquo;s quarters. A peep-hole opened upon the bridge; another on the
      court. In one corner, there was an opening to a tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you told me, Monsieur le Baron, that this tunnel is the only
      subterranean entrance to the castle and that it has been closed up for
      time immemorial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, unless there is some other entrance, known only to Arsène Lupin, we
      are quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed three chairs together, stretched himself upon them, lighted his
      pipe and sighed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Monsieur le Baron, I feel ashamed to accept your money for such a
      sinecure as this. I will tell the story to my friend Lupin. He will enjoy
      it immensely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron did not laugh. He was anxiously listening, but heard nothing
      save the beating of his own heart. From time to time, he leaned over the
      tunnel and cast a fearful eye into its depths. He heard the clock strike
      eleven, twelve, one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, he seized Ganimard&rsquo;s arm. The latter leaped up, awakened from
      his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; asked the baron, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was snoring, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, it is the horn of an automobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! it is very improbable that Lupin would use an automobile like a
      battering-ram to demolish your castle. Come, Monsieur le Baron, return to
      your post. I am going to sleep. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the only alarm. Ganimard resumed his interrupted slumbers, and
      the baron heard nothing except the regular snoring of his companion. At
      break of day, they left the room. The castle was enveloped in a profound
      calm; it was a peaceful dawn on the bosom of a tranquil river. They
      mounted the stairs, Cahorn radiant with joy, Ganimard calm as usual. They
      heard no sound; they saw nothing to arouse suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you, Monsieur le Baron? Really, I should not have
      accepted your offer. I am ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked the door and entered the gallery. Upon two chairs, with
      drooping heads and pendent arms, the detective&rsquo;s two assistants were
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tonnerre de nom d&rsquo;un chien!&rdquo; exclaimed Ganimard. At the same moment, the
      baron cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pictures! The credence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stammered, choked, with arms outstretched toward the empty places,
      toward the denuded walls where naught remained but the useless nails and
      cords. The Watteau, disappeared! The Rubens, carried away! The tapestries
      taken down! The cabinets, despoiled of their jewels!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my Louis XVI candelabra! And the Regent chandelier!...And my
      twelfth-century Virgin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran from one spot to another in wildest despair. He recalled the
      purchase price of each article, added up the figures, counted his losses,
      pell-mell, in confused words and unfinished phrases. He stamped with rage;
      he groaned with grief. He acted like a ruined man whose only hope is
      suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything could have consoled him, it would have been the stupefaction
      displayed by Ganimard. The famous detective did not move. He appeared to
      be petrified; he examined the room in a listless manner. The windows?....
      closed. The locks on the doors?.... intact. Not a break in the ceiling;
      not a hole in the floor. Everything was in perfect order. The theft had
      been carried out methodically, according to a logical and inexorable plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin....Arsène Lupin,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as if moved by anger, he rushed upon his two assistants and
      shook them violently. They did not awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over them and, in turn, examined them closely. They were asleep;
      but their response was unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been drugged,&rdquo; he said to the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By him, of course, or his men under his discretion. That work bears his
      stamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I am lost&mdash;nothing can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; assented Ganimard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dreadful; it is monstrous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lodge a complaint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh; it is well to try it. The law has some resources.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law! Bah! it is useless. You represent the law, and, at this moment,
      when you should be looking for a clue and trying to discover something,
      you do not even stir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discover something with Arsène Lupin! Why, my dear monsieur, Arsène Lupin
      never leaves any clue behind him. He leaves nothing to chance. Sometimes I
      think he put himself in my way and simply allowed me to arrest him in
      America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I must renounce my pictures! He has taken the gems of my
      collection. I would give a fortune to recover them. If there is no other
      way, let him name his own price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard regarded the baron attentively, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that is sensible. Will you stick to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idea that I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will discuss it later&mdash;if the official examination does not
      succeed. But, not one word about me, if you wish my assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He added, between his teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true I have nothing to boast of in this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistants were gradually regaining consciousness with the bewildered
      air of people who come out of an hypnotic sleep. They opened their eyes
      and looked about them in astonishment. Ganimard questioned them; they
      remembered nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have seen some one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you drink anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They considered a moment, and then one of them replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I drank a little water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of that carafe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; declared the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard smelled and tasted it. It had no particular taste and no odor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are wasting our time here. One can&rsquo;t decide an Arsène
      Lupin problem in five minutes. But, morbleu! I swear I will catch him
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same day, a charge of burglary was duly performed by Baron Cahorn
      against Arsène Lupin, a prisoner in the Prison de la Santé.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The baron afterwards regretted making the charge against Lupin when he saw
      his castle delivered over to the gendarmes, the procureur, the judge
      d&rsquo;instruction, the newspaper reporters and photographers, and a throng of
      idle curiosity-seekers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair soon became a topic of general discussion, and the name of
      Arsène Lupin excited the public imagination to such an extent that the
      newspapers filled their columns with the most fantastic stories of his
      exploits which found ready credence amongst their readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the letter of Arsène Lupin that was published in the &lsquo;Echo de France&rsquo;
      (no once ever knew how the newspaper obtained it), that letter in which
      Baron Cahorn was impudently warned of the coming theft, caused
      considerable excitement. The most fabulous theories were advanced. Some
      recalled the existence of the famous subterranean tunnels, and that was
      the line of research pursued by the officers of the law, who searched the
      house from top to bottom, questioned every stone, studied the wainscoting
      and the chimneys, the window-frames and the girders in the ceilings. By
      the light of torches, they examined the immense cellars where the lords of
      Malaquis were wont to store their munitions and provisions. They sounded
      the rocky foundation to its very centre. But it was all in vain. They
      discovered no trace of a subterranean tunnel. No secret passage existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the eager public declared that the pictures and furniture could not
      vanish like so many ghosts. They are substantial, material things and
      require doors and windows for their exits and their entrances, and so do
      the people that remove them. Who were those people? How did they gain
      access to the castle? And how did they leave it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The police officers of Rouen, convinced of their own impotence, solicited
      the assistance of the Parisian detective force. Mon. Dudouis, chief of the
      Sûreté, sent the best sleuths of the iron brigade. He himself spent
      forty-eight hours at the castle, but met with no success. Then he sent for
      Ganimard, whose past services had proved so useful when all else failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard listened, in silence, to the instructions of his superior; then,
      shaking his head, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, it is useless to ransack the castle. The solution of the
      problem lies elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Arsène Lupin! To support that theory, we must admit his
      intervention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do admit it. In fact, I consider it quite certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Ganimard, that is absurd. Arsène Lupin is in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant you that Arsène Lupin is in prison, closely guarded; but he must
      have fetters on his feet, manacles on his wrists, and gag in his mouth
      before I change my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so obstinate, Ganimard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Arsène Lupin is the only man in France of sufficient calibre to
      invent and carry out a scheme of that magnitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere words, Ganimard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But true ones. Look! What are they doing? Searching for subterranean
      passages, stones swinging on pivots, and other nonsense of that kind. But
      Lupin doesn&rsquo;t employ such old-fashioned methods. He is a modern cracksman,
      right up to date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how would you proceed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should ask your permission to spend an hour with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his cell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. During the return trip from America we became very friendly, and I
      venture to say that if he can give me any information without compromising
      himself he will not hesitate to save me from incurring useless trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was shortly after noon when Ganimard entered the cell of Arsène Lupin.
      The latter, who was lying on his bed, raised his head and uttered a cry of
      apparent joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! This is a real surprise. My dear Ganimard, here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganimard himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my chosen retreat, I have felt a desire for many things, but my
      fondest wish was to receive you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind of you, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. You know I hold you in the highest regard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am proud of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always said: Ganimard is our best detective. He is almost,&mdash;you
      see how candid I am!&mdash;he is almost as clever as Sherlock Holmes. But
      I am sorry that I cannot offer you anything better than this hard stool.
      And no refreshments! Not even a glass of beer! Of course, you will excuse
      me, as I am here only temporarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard smiled, and accepted the proffered seat. Then the prisoner
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu, how pleased I am to see the face of an honest man. I am so
      tired of those devils of spies who come here ten times a day to ransack my
      pockets and my cell to satisfy themselves that I am not preparing to
      escape. The government is very solicitous on my account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? I should be quite contented if they would allow me to live in my
      own quiet way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On other people&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. That would be so simple. But here, I am joking, and you are, no
      doubt, in a hurry. So let us come to business, Ganimard. To what do I owe
      the honor of this visit?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cahorn affair,&rdquo; declared Ganimard, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Wait, one moment. You see I have had so many affairs! First, let me
      fix in my mind the circumstances of this particular case....Ah! yes, now I
      have it. The Cahorn affair, Malaquis castle, Seine-Inférieure....Two
      Rubens, a Watteau, and a few trifling articles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trifling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! ma foi, all that is of slight importance. But it suffices to know
      that the affair interests you. How can I serve you, Ganimard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I explain to you what steps the authorities have taken in the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I have read the newspapers and I will frankly state that you
      have made very little progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is the reason I have come to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am entirely at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, the Cahorn affair was managed by you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From A to Z.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter of warning? the telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All mine. I ought to have the receipts somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène opened the drawer of a small table of plain white wood which, with
      the bed and stool, constituted all the furniture in his cell, and took
      therefrom two scraps of paper which he handed to Ganimard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the detective, in surprise, &ldquo;I though you were closely
      guarded and searched, and I find that you read the newspapers and collect
      postal receipts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! these people are so stupid! They open the lining of my vest, they
      examine the soles of my shoes, they sound the walls of my cell, but they
      never imagine that Arsène Lupin would be foolish enough to choose such a
      simple hiding place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard laughed, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a droll fellow you are! Really, you bewilder me. But, come now, tell
      me about the Cahorn affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! not quite so fast! You would rob me of all my secrets; expose all
      my little tricks. That is a very serious matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I wrong to count on your complaisance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Ganimard, and since you insist&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin paced his cell two or three times, then, stopping before
      Ganimard, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of my letter to the baron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you were amusing yourself by playing to the gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! playing to the gallery! Come, Ganimard, I thought you knew me better.
      Do I, Arsène Lupin, ever waste my time on such puerilities? Would I have
      written that letter if I could have robbed the baron without writing to
      him? I want you to understand that the letter was indispensable; it was
      the motor that set the whole machine in motion. Now, let us discuss
      together a scheme for the robbery of the Malaquis castle. Are you
      willing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us suppose a castle carefully closed and barricaded like that
      of the Baron Cahorn. Am I to abandon my scheme and renounce the treasures
      that I covet, upon the pretext that the castle which holds them is
      inaccessible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I make an assault upon the castle at the head of a band of
      adventurers as they did in ancient times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I gain admittance by stealth or cunning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is only one way open to me. I must have the owner of the
      castle invite me to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is surely an original method.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how easy! Let us suppose that one day the owner receives a letter
      warning him that a notorious burglar known as Arsène Lupin is plotting to
      rob him. What will he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send a letter to the Procureur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will laugh at him, <i>because the said Arsène Lupin is actually in
      prison</i>. Then, in his anxiety and fear, the simple man will ask the
      assistance of the first-comer, will he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he happens to read in a country newspaper that a celebrated
      detective is spending his vacation in a neighboring town&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will seek that detective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But, on the other hand, let us presume that, having foreseen
      that state of affairs, the said Arsène Lupin has requested one of his
      friends to visit Caudebec, make the acquaintance of the editor of the
      &lsquo;Réveil,&rsquo; a newspaper to which the baron is a subscriber, and let said
      editor understand that such person is the celebrated detective&mdash;then,
      what will happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The editor will announce in the &lsquo;Réveil&rsquo; the presence in Caudebec of said
      detective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; and one of two things will happen: either the fish&mdash;I mean
      Cahorn&mdash;will not bite, and nothing will happen; or, what is more
      likely, he will run and greedily swallow the bait. Thus, behold my Baron
      Cahorn imploring the assistance of one of my friends against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Original, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, the pseudo-detective at first refuses to give any assistance.
      On top of that comes the telegram from Arsène Lupin. The frightened baron
      rushes once more to my friend and offers him a definite sum of money for
      his services. My friend accepts and summons two members of our band, who,
      during the night, whilst Cahorn is under the watchful eye of his
      protector, removes certain articles by way of the window and lowers them
      with ropes into a nice little launch chartered for the occasion. Simple,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marvelous! Marvelous!&rdquo; exclaimed Ganimard. &ldquo;The boldness of the scheme
      and the ingenuity of all its details are beyond criticism. But who is the
      detective whose name and fame served as a magnet to attract the baron and
      draw him into your net?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one name could do it&mdash;only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin&rsquo;s personal enemy&mdash;the most illustrious Ganimard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself, Ganimard. And, really, it is very funny. If you go there, and
      the baron decides to talk, you will find that it will be your duty to
      arrest yourself, just as you arrested me in America. Hein! the revenge is
      really amusing: I cause Ganimard to arrest Ganimard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin laughed heartily. The detective, greatly vexed, bit his lips;
      to him the joke was quite devoid of humor. The arrival of a prison guard
      gave Ganimard an opportunity to recover himself. The man brought Arsène
      Lupin&rsquo;s luncheon, furnished by a neighboring restaurant. After depositing
      the tray upon the table, the guard retired. Lupin broke his bread, ate a
      few morsels, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, rest easy, my dear Ganimard, you will not go to Malaquis. I can tell
      you something that will astonish you: the Cahorn affair is on the point of
      being settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me; I have just seen the Chief of the Sureté.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that? Does Mon. Dudouis know my business better than I do myself?
      You will learn that Ganimard&mdash;excuse me&mdash;that the
      pseudo-Ganimard still remains on very good terms with the baron. The
      latter has authorized him to negotiate a very delicate transaction with
      me, and, at the present moment, in consideration of a certain sum, it is
      probable that the baron has recovered possession of his pictures and other
      treasures. And on their return, he will withdraw his complaint. Thus,
      there is no longer any theft, and the law must abandon the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard regarded the prisoner with a bewildered air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you know all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just received the telegram I was expecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just received a telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very moment, my dear friend. Out of politeness, I did not wish to
      read it in your presence. But if you will permit me&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are joking, Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, if you will be so kind as to break that egg, you will
      learn for yourself that I am not joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically, Ganimard obeyed, and cracked the egg-shell with the blade of
      a knife. He uttered a cry of surprise. The shell contained nothing but a
      small piece of blue paper. At the request of Arsène he unfolded it. It was
      a telegram, or rather a portion of a telegram from which the post-marks
      had been removed. It read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contract closed. Hundred thousand balls delivered. All well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred thousand balls?&rdquo; said Ganimard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one hundred thousand francs. Very little, but then, you know, these
      are hard times....And I have some heavy bills to meet. If you only knew my
      budget.... living in the city comes very high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard arose. His ill humor had disappeared. He reflected for a moment,
      glancing over the whole affair in an effort to discover a weak point;
      then, in a tone and manner that betrayed his admiration of the prisoner,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately, we do not have a dozen such as you to deal with; if we did,
      we would have to close up shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin assumed a modest air, as he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! a person must have some diversion to occupy his leisure hours,
      especially when he is in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Ganimard, &ldquo;your trial, your defense, the examination&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      that sufficient to occupy your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, because I have decided not to be present at my trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin repeated, positively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be present at my trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear monsieur, do you suppose I am going to rot upon the wet
      straw? You insult me. Arsène Lupin remains in prison just as long as it
      pleases him, and not one minute more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would have been more prudent if you had avoided getting
      there,&rdquo; said the detective, ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur jests? Monsieur must remember that he had the honor to
      effect my arrest. Know then, my worthy friend, that no one, not even you,
      could have placed a hand upon me if a much more important event had not
      occupied my attention at that critical moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You astonish me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman was looking at me, Ganimard, and I loved her. Do you fully
      understand what that means: to be under the eyes of a woman that one
      loves? I cared for nothing in the world but that. And that is why I am
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to say: you have been here a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I wished to forget. Do not laugh; it was a delightful
      adventure and it is still a tender memory. Besides, I have been suffering
      from neurasthenia. Life is so feverish these days that it is necessary to
      take the &lsquo;rest cure&rsquo; occasionally, and I find this spot a sovereign remedy
      for my tired nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin, you are not a bad fellow, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Lupin. &ldquo;Ganimard, this is Friday. On Wednesday next, at
      four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I will smoke my cigar at your house in the
      rue Pergolese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin, I will expect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands like two old friends who valued each other at their true
      worth; then the detective stepped to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganimard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Ganimard, as he turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten your watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it strayed into my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned the watch, excusing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me.... a bad habit. Because they have taken mine is no reason why
      I should take yours. Besides, I have a chronometer here that satisfies me
      fairly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took from the drawer a large gold watch and heavy chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whose pocket did that come?&rdquo; asked Ganimard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin gave a hasty glance at the initials engraved on the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J.B.....Who the devil can that be?....Ah! yes, I remember. Jules Bouvier,
      the judge who conducted my examination. A charming fellow!....&rdquo;

      III. The Escape of Arsène Lupin
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin had just finished his repast and taken from his pocket an
      excellent cigar, with a gold band, which he was examining with unusual
      care, when the door of his cell was opened. He had barely time to throw
      the cigar into the drawer and move away from the table. The guard entered.
      It was the hour for exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waiting for you, my dear boy,&rdquo; exclaimed Lupin, in his accustomed
      good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out together. As soon as they had disappeared at a turn in the
      corridor, two men entered the cell and commenced a minute examination of
      it. One was Inspector Dieuzy; the other was Inspector Folenfant. They
      wished to verify their suspicion that Arsène Lupin was in communication
      with his accomplices outside of the prison. On the preceding evening, the
      &lsquo;Grand Journal&rsquo; had published these lines addressed to its court reporter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a recent article you referred to me in most unjustifiable terms. Some
      days before the opening of my trial I will call you to account. Arsène
      Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The handwriting was certainly that of Arsène Lupin. Consequently, he sent
      letters; and, no doubt, received letters. It was certain that he was
      preparing for that escape thus arrogantly announced by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation had become intolerable. Acting in conjunction with the
      examining judge, the chief of the Sûreté, Mon. Dudouis, had visited the
      prison and instructed the gaoler in regard to the precautions necessary to
      insure Lupin&rsquo;s safety. At the same time, he sent the two men to examine
      the prisoner&rsquo;s cell. They raised every stone, ransacked the bed, did
      everything customary in such a case, but they discovered nothing, and were
      about to abandon their investigation when the guard entered hastily and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drawer.... look in the table-drawer. When I entered just now he was
      closing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They opened the drawer, and Dieuzy exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we have him this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folenfant stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. The chief will want to make an inventory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very choice cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it there, and notify the chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later Mon. Dudouis examined the contents of the drawer. First
      he discovered a bundle of newspaper clippings relating to Arsène Lupin
      taken from the &lsquo;Argus de la Presse,&rsquo; then a tobacco-box, a pipe, some
      paper called &ldquo;onion-peel,&rdquo; and two books. He read the titles of the books.
      One was an English edition of Carlyle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hero-worship&rdquo;; the other was a
      charming elzevir, in modern binding, the &ldquo;Manual of Epictetus,&rdquo; a German
      translation published at Leyden in 1634. On examining the books, he found
      that all the pages were underlined and annotated. Were they prepared as a
      code for correspondence, or did they simply express the studious character
      of the reader? Then he examined the tobacco-box and the pipe. Finally, he
      took up the famous cigar with its gold band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fichtre!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Our friend smokes a good cigar. It&rsquo;s a Henry
      Clay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the mechanical action of an habitual smoker, he placed the cigar
      close to his ear and squeezed it to make it crack. Immediately he uttered
      a cry of surprise. The cigar had yielded under the pressure of his
      fingers. He examined it more closely, and quickly discovered something
      white between the leaves of tobacco. Delicately, with the aid of a pin, he
      withdrew a roll of very thin paper, scarcely larger than a toothpick. It
      was a letter. He unrolled it, and found these words, written in a feminine
      handwriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The basket has taken the place of the others. Eight out of ten are ready.
      On pressing the outer foot the plate goes downward. From twelve to sixteen
      every day, H-P will wait. But where? Reply at once. Rest easy; your friend
      is watching over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mon. Dudouis reflected a moment, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite clear.... the basket.... the eight compartments.... From
      twelve to sixteen means from twelve to four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this H-P, that will wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-P must mean automobile. H-P, horsepower, is the way they indicate
      strength of the motor. A twenty-four H-P is an automobile of twenty-four
      horsepower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had the prisoner finished his breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as he has not yet read the message, which is proved by the condition
      of the cigar, it is probable that he had just received it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his food. Concealed in his bread or in a potato, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. His food was allowed to be brought in simply to trap him, but
      we have never found anything in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will look for Lupin&rsquo;s reply this evening. Detain him outside for a few
      minutes. I shall take this to the examining judge, and, if he agrees with
      me, we will have the letter photographed at once, and in an hour you can
      replace the letter in the drawer in a cigar similar to this. The prisoner
      must have no cause for suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not without a certain curiosity that Mon. Dudouis returned to the
      prison in the evening, accompanied by Inspector Dieuzy. Three empty plates
      were sitting on the stove in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has eaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dieuzy, please cut that macaroni into very small pieces, and open that
      bread-roll....Nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mon. Dudouis examined the plates, the fork, the spoon, and the knife&mdash;an
      ordinary knife with a rounded blade. He turned the handle to the left;
      then to the right. It yielded and unscrewed. The knife was hollow, and
      served as a hiding-place for a sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peuh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is not very clever for a man like Arsène. But we
      mustn&rsquo;t lose any time. You, Dieuzy, go and search the restaurant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he read the note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust to you, H-P will follow at a distance every day. I will go ahead.
      Au revoir, dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; cried Mon. Dudouis, rubbing his hands gleefully, &ldquo;I think we
      have the affair in our own hands. A little strategy on our part, and the
      escape will be a success in so far as the arrest of his confederates are
      concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if Arsène Lupin slips through your fingers?&rdquo; suggested the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have a sufficient number of men to prevent that. If, however, he
      displays too much cleverness, ma foi, so much the worse for him! As to his
      band of robbers, since the chief refuses to speak, the others must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      And, as a matter of fact, Arsène Lupin had very little to say. For several
      months, Mon. Jules Bouvier, the examining judge, had exerted himself in
      vain. The investigation had been reduced to a few uninteresting arguments
      between the judge and the advocate, Maître Danval, one of the leaders of
      the bar. From time to time, through courtesy, Arsène Lupin would speak.
      One day he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, le judge, I quite agree with you: the robbery of the
      Crédit Lyonnais, the theft in the rue de Babylone, the issue of the
      counterfeit bank-notes, the burglaries at the various châteaux, Armesnil,
      Gouret, Imblevain, Groseillers, Malaquis, all my work, monsieur, I did it
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you explain to me&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless. I confess everything in a lump, everything and even ten
      times more than you know nothing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wearied by his fruitless task, the judge had suspended his examinations,
      but he resumed them after the two intercepted messages were brought to his
      attention; and regularly, at mid-day, Arsène Lupin was taken from the
      prison to the Dépôt in the prison-van with a certain number of other
      prisoners. They returned about three or four o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, one afternoon, this return trip was made under unusual conditions.
      The other prisoners not having been examined, it was decided to take back
      Arsène Lupin first, thus he found himself alone in the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      These prison-vans, vulgarly called &ldquo;panniers à salade&rdquo;&mdash;or
      salad-baskets&mdash;are divided lengthwise by a central corridor from
      which open ten compartments, five on either side. Each compartment is so
      arranged that the occupant must assume and retain a sitting posture, and,
      consequently, the five prisoners are seated one upon the other, and yet
      separated one from the other by partitions. A municipal guard, standing at
      one end, watches over the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsène was placed in the third cell on the right, and the heavy vehicle
      started. He carefully calculated when they left the quai de l&rsquo;Horloge, and
      when they passed the Palais de Justice. Then, about the centre of the
      bridge Saint Michel, with his outer foot, that is to say, his right foot,
      he pressed upon the metal plate that closed his cell. Immediately
      something clicked, and the metal plate moved. He was able to ascertain
      that he was located between the two wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, keeping a sharp look-out. The vehicle was proceeding slowly
      along the boulevard Saint Michel. At the corner of Saint Germain it
      stopped. A truck horse had fallen. The traffic having been interrupted, a
      vast throng of fiacres and omnibuses had gathered there. Arsène Lupin
      looked out. Another prison-van had stopped close to the one he occupied.
      He moved the plate still farther, put his foot on one of the spokes of the
      wheel and leaped to the ground. A coachman saw him, roared with laughter,
      then tried to raise an outcry, but his voice was lost in the noise of the
      traffic that had commenced to move again. Moreover, Arsène Lupin was
      already far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had run for a few steps; but, once upon the sidewalk, he turned and
      looked around; he seemed to scent the wind like a person who is uncertain
      which direction to take. Then, having decided, he put his hands in his
      pockets, and, with the careless air of an idle stroller, he proceeded up
      the boulevard. It was a warm, bright autumn day, and the cafés were full.
      He took a seat on the terrace of one of them. He ordered a bock and a
      package of cigarettes. He emptied his glass slowly, smoked one cigarette
      and lighted a second. Then he asked the waiter to send the proprietor to
      him. When the proprietor came, Arsène spoke to him in a voice loud enough
      to be heard by everyone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say, monsieur, I have forgotten my pocketbook. Perhaps, on
      the strength of my name, you will be pleased to give me credit for a few
      days. I am Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor looked at him, thinking he was joking. But Arsène repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lupin, prisoner at the Santé, but now a fugitive. I venture to assume
      that the name inspires you with perfect confidence in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he walked away, amidst shouts of laughter, whilst the proprietor stood
      amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin strolled along the rue Soufflot, and turned into the rue Saint
      Jacques. He pursued his way slowly, smoking his cigarettes and looking
      into the shop-windows. At the Boulevard de Port Royal he took his
      bearings, discovered where he was, and then walked in the direction of the
      rue de la Santé. The high forbidding walls of the prison were now before
      him. He pulled his hat forward to shade his face; then, approaching the
      sentinel, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the prison de la Santé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to regain my cell. The van left me on the way, and I would not
      abuse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, young man, move along&mdash;quick!&rdquo; growled the sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, but I must pass through that gate. And if you prevent Arsène
      Lupin from entering the prison it will cost you dear, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin! What are you talking about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I haven&rsquo;t a card with me,&rdquo; said Arsène, fumbling in his
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentinel eyed him from head to foot, in astonishment. Then, without a
      word, he rang a bell. The iron gate was partly opened, and Arsène stepped
      inside. Almost immediately he encountered the keeper of the prison,
      gesticulating and feigning a violent anger. Arsène smiled and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, monsieur, don&rsquo;t play that game with me. What! they take the
      precaution to carry me alone in the van, prepare a nice little
      obstruction, and imagine I am going to take to my heels and rejoin my
      friends. Well, and what about the twenty agents of the Sûreté who
      accompanied us on foot, in fiacres and on bicycles? No, the arrangement
      did not please me. I should not have got away alive. Tell me, monsieur,
      did they count on that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you, monsieur, not to worry about me. When I wish to escape I
      shall not require any assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the second day thereafter, the &lsquo;Echo de France,&rsquo; which had apparently
      become the official reporter of the exploits of Arsène Lupin,&mdash;it was
      said that he was one of its principal shareholders&mdash;published a most
      complete account of this attempted escape. The exact wording of the
      messages exchanged between the prisoner and his mysterious friend, the
      means by which correspondence was constructed, the complicity of the
      police, the promenade on the Boulevard Saint Michel, the incident at the
      café Soufflot, everything was disclosed. It was known that the search of
      the restaurant and its waiters by Inspector Dieuzy had been fruitless. And
      the public also learned an extraordinary thing which demonstrated the
      infinite variety of resources that Lupin possessed: the prison-van, in
      which he was being carried, was prepared for the occasion and substituted
      by his accomplices for one of the six vans which did service at the
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next escape of Arsène Lupin was not doubted by anyone. He announced it
      himself, in categorical terms, in a reply to Mon. Bouvier on the day
      following his attempted escape. The judge having made a jest about the
      affair, Arsène was annoyed, and, firmly eyeing the judge, he said,
      emphatically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, monsieur! I give you my word of honor that this attempted
      flight was simply preliminary to my general plan of escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary that you should understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the judge, in the course of that examination which was reported
      at length in the columns of the &lsquo;Echo de France,&rsquo; when the judge sought to
      resume his investigation, Arsène Lupin exclaimed, with an assumed air of
      lassitude:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu, what&rsquo;s the use! All these questions are of no
      importance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! No importance?&rdquo; cried the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; because I shall not be present at the trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have fully decided on that, and nothing will change my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such assurance combined with the inexplicable indiscretions that Arsène
      committed every day served to annoy and mystify the officers of the law.
      There were secrets known only to Arsène Lupin; secrets that he alone could
      divulge. But for what purpose did he reveal them? And how?
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin was changed to another cell. The judge closed his preliminary
      investigation. No further proceedings were taken in his case for a period
      of two months, during which time Arsène was seen almost constantly lying
      on his bed with his face turned toward the wall. The changing of his cell
      seemed to discourage him. He refused to see his advocate. He exchanged
      only a few necessary words with his keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the fortnight preceding his trial, he resumed his vigorous life. He
      complained of want of air. Consequently, early every morning he was
      allowed to exercise in the courtyard, guarded by two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public curiosity had not died out; every day it expected to be regaled
      with news of his escape; and, it is true, he had gained a considerable
      amount of public sympathy by reason of his verve, his gayety, his
      diversity, his inventive genius and the mystery of his life. Arsène Lupin
      must escape. It was his inevitable fate. The public expected it, and was
      surprised that the event had been delayed so long. Every morning the
      Préfect of Police asked his secretary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, has he escaped yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur le Préfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, on the day before the trial, a gentleman called at the office of the
      &lsquo;Grand Journal,&rsquo; asked to see the court reporter, threw his card in the
      reporter&rsquo;s face, and walked rapidly away. These words were written on the
      card: &ldquo;Arsène Lupin always keeps his promises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was under these conditions that the trial commenced. An enormous crowd
      gathered at the court. Everybody wished to see the famous Arsène Lupin.
      They had a gleeful anticipation that the prisoner would play some
      audacious pranks upon the judge. Advocates and magistrates, reporters and
      men of the world, actresses and society women were crowded together on the
      benches provided for the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dark, sombre day, with a steady downpour of rain. Only a dim
      light pervaded the courtroom, and the spectators caught a very indistinct
      view of the prisoner when the guards brought him in. But his heavy,
      shambling walk, the manner in which he dropped into his seat, and his
      passive, stupid appearance were not at all prepossessing. Several times
      his advocate&mdash;one of Mon. Danval&rsquo;s assistants&mdash;spoke to him, but
      he simply shook his head and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk read the indictment, then the judge spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prisoner at the bar, stand up. Your name, age, and occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not receiving any reply, the judge repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name? I ask you your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thick, slow voice muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baudru, Désiré.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of surprise pervaded the courtroom. But the judge proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baudru, Désiré? Ah! a new alias! Well, as you have already assumed a
      dozen different names and this one is, no doubt, as imaginary as the
      others, we will adhere to the name of Arsène Lupin, by which you are more
      generally known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge referred to his notes, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For, despite the most diligent search, your past history remains unknown.
      Your case is unique in the annals of crime. We know not whom you are,
      whence you came, your birth and breeding&mdash;all is a mystery to us.
      Three years ago you appeared in our midst as Arsène Lupin, presenting to
      us a strange combination of intelligence and perversion, immorality and
      generosity. Our knowledge of your life prior to that date is vague and
      problematical. It may be that the man called Rostat who, eight years ago,
      worked with Dickson, the prestidigitator, was none other than Arsène
      Lupin. It is probable that the Russian student who, six years ago,
      attended the laboratory of Doctor Altier at the Saint Louis Hospital, and
      who often astonished the doctor by the ingenuity of his hypotheses on
      subjects of bacteriology and the boldness of his experiments in diseases
      of the skin, was none other than Arsène Lupin. It is probable, also, that
      Arsène Lupin was the professor who introduced the Japanese art of
      jiu-jitsu to the Parisian public. We have some reason to believe that
      Arsène Lupin was the bicyclist who won the Grand Prix de l&rsquo;Exposition,
      received his ten thousand francs, and was never heard of again. Arsène
      Lupin may have been, also, the person who saved so many lives through the
      little dormer-window at the Charity Bazaar; and, at the same time, picked
      their pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge paused for a moment, then continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is that epoch which seems to have been utilized by you in a thorough
      preparation for the warfare you have since waged against society; a
      methodical apprenticeship in which you developed your strength, energy and
      skill to the highest point possible. Do you acknowledge the accuracy of
      these facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this discourse the prisoner had stood balancing himself, first on
      one foot, then on the other, with shoulders stooped and arms inert. Under
      the strongest light one could observe his extreme thinness, his hollow
      cheeks, his projecting cheek-bones, his earthen-colored face dotted with
      small red spots and framed in a rough, straggling beard. Prison life had
      caused him to age and wither. He had lost the youthful face and elegant
      figure we had seen portrayed so often in the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared as if he had not heard the question propounded by the judge.
      Twice it was repeated to him. Then he raised his eyes, seemed to reflect,
      then, making a desperate effort, he murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baudru, Désiré.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge smiled, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand the theory of your defense, Arsène Lupin. If you are
      seeking to avoid responsibility for your crimes on the ground of
      imbecility, such a line of defense is open to you. But I shall proceed
      with the trial and pay no heed to your vagaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then narrated at length the various thefts, swindles and forgeries
      charged against Lupin. Sometimes he questioned the prisoner, but the
      latter simply grunted or remained silent. The examination of witnesses
      commenced. Some of the evidence given was immaterial; other portions of it
      seemed more important, but through all of it there ran a vein of
      contradictions and inconsistencies. A wearisome obscurity enveloped the
      proceedings, until Detective Ganimard was called as a witness; then
      interest was revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning the actions of the veteran detective appeared strange
      and unaccountable. He was nervous and ill at ease. Several times he looked
      at the prisoner, with obvious doubt and anxiety. Then, with his hands
      resting on the rail in front of him, he recounted the events in which he
      had participated, including his pursuit of the prisoner across Europe and
      his arrival in America. He was listened to with great avidity, as his
      capture of Arsène Lupin was well known to everyone through the medium of
      the press. Toward the close of his testimony, after referring to his
      conversations with Arsène Lupin, he stopped, twice, embarrassed and
      undecided. It was apparent that he was possessed of some thought which he
      feared to utter. The judge said to him, sympathetically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are ill, you may retire for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, but&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, looked sharply at the prisoner, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask permission to scrutinize the prisoner at closer range. There is
      some mystery about him that I must solve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He approached the accused man, examined him attentively for several
      minutes, then returned to the witness-stand, and, in an almost solemn
      voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, on oath, that the prisoner now before me is not Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence followed the statement. The judge, nonplused for a
      moment, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What do you mean? That is absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first sight there is a certain resemblance, but if you carefully
      consider the nose, the mouth, the hair, the color of skin, you will see
      that it is not Arsène Lupin. And the eyes! Did he ever have those
      alcoholic eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, witness! What do you mean? Do you pretend to say that we are
      trying the wrong man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, yes. Arsène Lupin has, in some manner, contrived to put
      this poor devil in his place, unless this man is a willing accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This dramatic dénouement caused much laughter and excitement amongst the
      spectators. The judge adjourned the trial, and sent for Mon. Bouvier, the
      gaoler, and guards employed in the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the trial was resumed, Mon. Bouvier and the gaoler examined the
      accused and declared that there was only a very slight resemblance between
      the prisoner and Arsène Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then!&rdquo; exclaimed the judge, &ldquo;who is this man? Where does he come
      from? What is he in prison for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two of the prison-guards were called and both of them declared that the
      prisoner was Arsène Lupin. The judged breathed once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one of the guards then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I think it is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the judge, impatiently, &ldquo;you *think* it is he! What do you
      mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I saw very little of the prisoner. He was placed in my charge in
      the evening and, for two months, he seldom stirred, but laid on his bed
      with his face to the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the time prior to those two months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before that he occupied a cell in another part of the prison. He was not
      in cell 24.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the head gaoler interrupted, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We changed him to another cell after his attempted escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, monsieur, you have seen him during those two months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no occasion to see him. He was always quiet and orderly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this prisoner is not Arsène Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who is he?&rdquo; demanded the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we have before us a man who was substituted for Arsène Lupin, two
      months ago. How do you explain that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In absolute despair, the judge turned to the accused and addressed him in
      a conciliatory tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prisoner, can you tell me how, and since when, you became an inmate of
      the Prison de la Santé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engaging manner of the judge was calculated to disarm the mistrust and
      awaken the understanding of the accused man. He tried to reply. Finally,
      under clever and gentle questioning, he succeeded in framing a few phrases
      from which the following story was gleaned: Two months ago he had been
      taken to the Dépôt, examined and released. As he was leaving the building,
      a free man, he was seized by two guards and placed in the prison-van.
      Since then he had occupied cell 24. He was contented there, plenty to eat,
      and he slept well&mdash;so he did not complain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that seemed probable; and, amidst the mirth and excitement of the
      spectators, the judge adjourned the trial until the story could be
      investigated and verified.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The following facts were at once established by an examination of the
      prison records: Eight weeks before a man named Baudru Désiré had slept at
      the Dépôt. He was released the next day, and left the Dépôt at two o&rsquo;clock
      in the afternoon. On the same day at two o&rsquo;clock, having been examined for
      the last time, Arsène Lupin left the Dépôt in a prison-van.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the guards made a mistake? Had they been deceived by the resemblance
      and carelessly substituted this man for their prisoner?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another question suggested itself: Had the substitution been arranged in
      advance? In that event Baudru must have been an accomplice and must have
      caused his own arrest for the express purpose of taking Lupin&rsquo;s place. But
      then, by what miracle had such a plan, based on a series of improbable
      chances, been carried to success?
    </p>
    <p>
      Baudru Désiré was turned over to the anthropological service; they had
      never seen anything like him. However, they easily traced his past
      history. He was known at Courbevois, at Asnières and at Levallois. He
      lived on alms and slept in one of those rag-picker&rsquo;s huts near the barrier
      de Ternes. He had disappeared from there a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been enticed away by Arsène Lupin? There was no evidence to that
      effect. And even if that was so, it did not explain the flight of the
      prisoner. That still remained a mystery. Amongst twenty theories which
      sought to explain it, not one was satisfactory. Of the escape itself,
      there was no doubt; an escape that was incomprehensible, sensational, in
      which the public, as well as the officers of the law, could detect a
      carefully prepared plan, a combination of circumstances marvelously
      dove-tailed, whereof the dénouement fully justified the confident
      prediction of Arsène Lupin: &ldquo;I shall not be present at my trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a month of patient investigation, the problem remained unsolved. The
      poor devil of a Baudru could not be kept in prison indefinitely, and to
      place him on trial would be ridiculous. There was no charge against him.
      Consequently, he was released; but the chief of the Sûrété resolved to
      keep him under surveillance. This idea originated with Ganimard. From his
      point of view there was neither complicity nor chance. Baudru was an
      instrument upon which Arsène Lupin had played with his extraordinary
      skill. Baudru, when set at liberty, would lead them to Arsène Lupin or, at
      least, to some of his accomplices. The two inspectors, Folenfant and
      Dieuzy, were assigned to assist Ganimard.
    </p>
    <p>
      One foggy morning in January the prison gates opened and Baudru Désiré
      stepped forth&mdash;a free man. At first he appeared to be quite
      embarrassed, and walked like a person who has no precise idea whither he
      is going. He followed the rue de la Santé and the rue Saint Jacques. He
      stopped in front of an old-clothes shop, removed his jacket and his vest,
      sold his vest on which he realized a few sous; then, replacing his jacket,
      he proceeded on his way. He crossed the Seine. At the Châtelet an omnibus
      passed him. He wished to enter it, but there was no place. The controller
      advised him to secure a number, so he entered the waiting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard called to his two assistants, and, without removing his eyes from
      the waiting room, he said to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a carriage.... no, two. That will be better. I will go with one of
      you, and we will follow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men obeyed. Yet Baudru did not appear. Ganimard entered the
      waiting-room. It was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot that I am!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I forgot there was another exit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an interior corridor extending from the waiting-room to the rue
      Saint Martin. Ganimard rushed through it and arrived just in time to
      observe Baudru upon the top of the Batignolles-Jardin de Plates omnibus as
      it was turning the corner of the rue de Rivoli. He ran and caught the
      omnibus. But he had lost his two assistants. He must continue the pursuit
      alone. In his anger he was inclined to seize the man by the collar without
      ceremony. Was it not with premeditation and by means of an ingenious ruse
      that his pretended imbecile had separated him from his assistants?
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Baudru. The latter was asleep on the bench, his head rolling
      from side to side, his mouth half-opened, and an incredible expression of
      stupidity on his blotched face. No, such an adversary was incapable of
      deceiving old Ganimard. It was a stroke of luck&mdash;nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Galleries-Lafayette, the man leaped from the omnibus and took the
      La Muette tramway, following the boulevard Haussmann and the avenue Victor
      Hugo. Baudru alighted at La Muette station; and, with a nonchalant air,
      strolled into the Bois de Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered through one path after another, and sometimes retraced his
      steps. What was he seeking? Had he any definite object? At the end of an
      hour, he appeared to be faint from fatigue, and, noticing a bench, he sat
      down. The spot, not far from Auteuil, on the edge of a pond hidden amongst
      the trees, was absolutely deserted. After the lapse of another half-hour,
      Ganimard became impatient and resolved to speak to the man. He approached
      and took a seat beside Baudru, lighted a cigarette, traced some figures in
      the sand with the end of his cane, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasant day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response. But, suddenly the man burst into laughter, a happy, mirthful
      laugh, spontaneous and irresistible. Ganimard felt his hair stand on end
      in horror and surprise. It was that laugh, that infernal laugh he knew so
      well!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden movement, he seized the man by the collar and looked at him
      with a keen, penetrating gaze; and found that he no longer saw the man
      Baudru. To be sure, he saw Baudru; but, at the same time, he saw the
      other, the real man, Lupin. He discovered the intense life in the eyes, he
      filled up the shrunken features, he perceived the real flesh beneath the
      flabby skin, the real mouth through the grimaces that deformed it. Those
      were the eyes and mouth of the other, and especially his keen, alert,
      mocking expression, so clear and youthful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin, Arsène Lupin,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a sudden fit of rage, he seized Lupin by the throat and tried to
      hold him down. In spite of his fifty years, he still possessed unusual
      strength, whilst his adversary was apparently in a weak condition. But the
      struggle was a brief one. Arsène Lupin made only a slight movement, and,
      as suddenly as he had made the attack, Ganimard released his hold. His
      right arm fell inert, useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had taken lessons in jiu-jitsu at the quai des Orfèvres,&rdquo; said
      Lupin, &ldquo;you would know that that blow is called udi-shi-ghi in Japanese. A
      second more, and I would have broken your arm and that would have been
      just what you deserve. I am surprised that you, an old friend whom I
      respect and before whom I voluntarily expose my incognito, should abuse my
      confidence in that violent manner. It is unworthy&mdash;Ah! What&rsquo;s the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard did not reply. That escape for which he deemed himself
      responsible&mdash;was it not he, Ganimard, who, by his sensational
      evidence, had led the court into serious error? That escape appeared to
      him like a dark cloud on his professional career. A tear rolled down his
      cheek to his gray moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mon Dieu, Ganimard, don&rsquo;t take it to heart. If you had not spoken, I
      would have arranged for some one else to do it. I couldn&rsquo;t allow poor
      Baudru Désiré to be convicted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; murmured Ganimard, &ldquo;it was you that was there? And now you are
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, always I, only I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is not the work of a sorcerer. Simply, as the judge remarked at
      the trial, the apprenticeship of a dozen years that equips a man to cope
      successfully with all the obstacles in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your face? Your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can understand that if I worked eighteen months with Doctor Altier at
      the Saint-Louis hospital, it was not out of love for the work. I
      considered that he, who would one day have the honor of calling himself
      Arsène Lupin, ought to be exempt from the ordinary laws governing
      appearance and identity. Appearance? That can be modified at will. For
      instance, a hypodermic injection of paraffine will puff up the skin at the
      desired spot. Pyrogallic acid will change your skin to that of an Indian.
      The juice of the greater celandine will adorn you with the most beautiful
      eruptions and tumors. Another chemical affects the growth of your beard
      and hair; another changes the tone of your voice. Add to that two months
      of dieting in cell 24; exercises repeated a thousand times to enable me to
      hold my features in a certain grimace, to carry my head at a certain
      inclination, and adapt my back and shoulders to a stooping posture. Then
      five drops of atropine in the eyes to make them haggard and wild, and the
      trick is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand how you deceived the guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The change was progressive. The evolution was so gradual that they failed
      to notice it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Baudru Désiré?&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;Baudru exists. He is a poor, harmless fellow whom I
      met last year; and, really, he bears a certain resemblance to me.
      Considering my arrest as a possible event, I took charge of Baudru and
      studied the points wherein we differed in appearance with a view to
      correct them in my own person. My friends caused him to remain at the
      Dépôt overnight, and to leave there next day about the same hour as I did&mdash;a
      coincidence easily arranged. Of course, it was necessary to have a record
      of his detention at the Dépôt in order to establish the fact that such a
      person was a reality; otherwise, the police would have sought elsewhere to
      find out my identity. But, in offering to them this excellent Baudru, it
      was inevitable, you understand, inevitable that they would seize upon him,
      and, despite the insurmountable difficulties of a substitution, they would
      prefer to believe in a substitution than confess their ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, of course,&rdquo; said Ganimard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; exclaimed Arsène Lupin, &ldquo;I held in my hands a trump-card: an
      anxious public watching and waiting for my escape. And that is the fatal
      error into which you fell, you and the others, in the course of that
      fascinating game pending between me and the officers of the law wherein
      the stake was my liberty. And you supposed that I was playing to the
      gallery; that I was intoxicated with my success. I, Arsène Lupin, guilty
      of such weakness! Oh, no! And, no longer ago than the Cahorn affair, you
      said: &ldquo;When Arsène Lupin cries from the housetops that he will escape, he
      has some object in view.&rdquo; But, sapristi, you must understand that in order
      to escape I must create, in advance, a public belief in that escape, a
      belief amounting to an article of faith, an absolute conviction, a reality
      as glittering as the sun. And I did create that belief that Arsène Lupin
      would escape, that Arsène Lupin would not be present at his trial. And
      when you gave your evidence and said: &ldquo;That man is not Arsène Lupin,&rdquo;
       everybody was prepared to believe you. Had one person doubted it, had any
      one uttered this simple restriction: Suppose it is Arsène Lupin?&mdash;from
      that moment, I was lost. If anyone had scrutinized my face, not imbued
      with the idea that I was not Arsène Lupin, as you and the others did at my
      trial, but with the idea that I might be Arsène Lupin; then, despite all
      my precautions, I should have been recognized. But I had no fear.
      Logically, psychologically, no once could entertain the idea that I was
      Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grasped Ganimard&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Ganimard, confess that on the Wednesday after our conversation in
      the prison de la Santé, you expected me at your house at four o&rsquo;clock,
      exactly as I said I would go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your prison-van?&rdquo; said Ganimard, evading the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bluff! Some of my friends secured that old unused van and wished to
      make the attempt. But I considered it impractical without the concurrence
      of a number of unusual circumstances. However, I found it useful to carry
      out that attempted escape and give it the widest publicity. An audaciously
      planned escape, though not completed, gave to the succeeding one the
      character of reality simply by anticipation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that the cigar....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollowed by myself, as well as the knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Written by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the mysterious correspondent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ganimard reflected a moment, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the anthropological service had Baudru&rsquo;s case under consideration,
      why did they not perceive that his measurements coincided with those of
      Arsène Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My measurements are not in existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, they are false. I have given considerable attention to that
      question. In the first place, the Bertillon system records the visible
      marks of identification&mdash;and you have seen that they are not
      infallible&mdash;and, after that, the measurements of the head, the
      fingers, the ears, etc. Of course, such measurements are more or less
      infallible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it costs money to get around them. Before we left America, one of
      the employees of the service there accepted so much money to insert false
      figures in my measurements. Consequently, Baudru&rsquo;s measurements should not
      agree with those of Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a short silence, Ganimard asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; replied Lupin, &ldquo;I am going to take a rest, enjoy the best of food
      and drink and gradually recover my former healthy condition. It is all
      very well to become Baudru or some other person, on occasion, and to
      change your personality as you do your shirt, but you soon grow weary of
      the change. I feel exactly as I imagine the man who lost his shadow must
      have felt, and I shall be glad to be Arsène Lupin once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to and fro for a few minutes, then, stopping in front of
      Ganimard, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing more to say, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I should like to know if you intend to reveal the true state of
      facts connected with your escape. The mistake that I made&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no one will ever know that it was Arsène Lupin who was discharged. It
      is to my own interest to surround myself with mystery, and therefore I
      shall permit my escape to retain its almost miraculous character. So, have
      no fear on that score, my dear friend. I shall say nothing. And now,
      good-bye. I am going out to dinner this evening, and have only sufficient
      time to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I though you wanted a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there are duties to society that one cannot avoid. To-morrow, I shall
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you dine to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the British Ambassador!&rdquo;

      IV. The Mysterious Traveller
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening before, I had sent my automobile to Rouen by the highway. I
      was to travel to Rouen by rail, on my way to visit some friends that live
      on the banks of the Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Paris, a few minutes before the train started, seven gentlemen entered
      my compartment; five of them were smoking. No matter that the journey was
      a short one, the thought of traveling with such a company was not
      agreeable to me, especially as the car was built on the old model, without
      a corridor. I picked up my overcoat, my newspapers and my time-table, and
      sought refuge in a neighboring compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was occupied by a lady, who, at sight of me, made a gesture of
      annoyance that did not escape my notice, and she leaned toward a gentleman
      who was standing on the step and was, no doubt, her husband. The gentleman
      scrutinized me closely, and, apparently, my appearance did not displease
      him, for he smiled as he spoke to his wife with the air of one who
      reassures a frightened child. She smiled also, and gave me a friendly
      glance as if she now understood that I was one of those gallant men with
      whom a woman can remain shut up for two hours in a little box, six feet
      square, and have nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an important appointment, my dear, and cannot wait any longer.
      Adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her affectionately and went away. His wife threw him a few
      kisses and waved her handkerchief. The whistle sounded, and the train
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that precise moment, and despite the protests of the guards, the door
      was opened, and a man rushed into our compartment. My companion, who was
      standing and arranging her luggage, uttered a cry of terror and fell upon
      the seat. I am not a coward&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I confess that
      such intrusions at the last minute are always disconcerting. They have a
      suspicious, unnatural aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the appearance of the new arrival greatly modified the
      unfavorable impression produced by his precipitant action. He was
      correctly and elegantly dressed, wore a tasteful cravat, correct gloves,
      and his face was refined and intelligent. But, where the devil had I seen
      that face before? Because, beyond all possible doubt, I had seen it. And
      yet the memory of it was so vague and indistinct that I felt it would be
      useless to try to recall it at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, directing my attention to the lady, I was amazed at the pallor and
      anxiety I saw in her face. She was looking at her neighbor&mdash;they
      occupied seats on the same side of the compartment&mdash;with an
      expression of intense alarm, and I perceived that one of her trembling
      hands was slowly gliding toward a little traveling bag that was lying on
      the seat about twenty inches from her. She finished by seizing it and
      nervously drawing it to her. Our eyes met, and I read in hers so much
      anxiety and fear that I could not refrain from speaking to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, madame? Shall I open the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her only reply was a gesture indicating that she was afraid of our
      companion. I smiled, as her husband had done, shrugged my shoulders, and
      explained to her, in pantomime, that she had nothing to fear, that I was
      there, and, besides, the gentleman appeared to be a very harmless
      individual. At that moment, he turned toward us, scrutinized both of us
      from head to foot, then settled down in his corner and paid us no more
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short silence, the lady, as if she had mustered all her energy to
      perform a desperate act, said to me, in an almost inaudible voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who is on our train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He.... he....I assure you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not taken her eyes off our companion, and it was to him rather
      than to me that she uttered the syllables of that disquieting name. He
      drew his hat over his face. Was that to conceal his agitation or, simply,
      to arrange himself for sleep? Then I said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, through contumacy, Arsène Lupin was sentenced to twenty years&rsquo;
      imprisonment at hard labor. Therefore it is improbable that he would be so
      imprudent, to-day, as to show himself in public. Moreover, the newspapers
      have announced his appearance in Turkey since his escape from the Santé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is on this train at the present moment,&rdquo; the lady proclaimed, with
      the obvious intention of being heard by our companion; &ldquo;my husband is one
      of the directors in the penitentiary service, and it was the stationmaster
      himself who told us that a search was being made for Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may have been mistaken&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he was seen in the waiting-room. He bought a first-class ticket for
      Rouen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has disappeared. The guard at the waiting-room door did not see him
      pass, and it is supposed that he had got into the express that leaves ten
      minutes after us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, they will be sure to catch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless, at the last moment, he leaped from that train to come here, into
      our train.... which is quite probable.... which is almost certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, he will be arrested just the same; for the employees and guards
      would no doubt observe his passage from one train to the other, and, when
      we arrive at Rouen, they will arrest him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him&mdash;never! He will find some means of escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, I wish him &lsquo;bon voyage.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in the meantime, think what he may do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He may do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly agitated, and, truly, the situation justified, to some
      extent, her nervous excitement. I was impelled to say to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, there are many strange coincidences, but you need have no
      fear. Admitting that Arsène Lupin is on this train, he will not commit any
      indiscretion; he will be only too happy to escape the peril that already
      threatens him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My words did not reassure her, but she remained silent for a time. I
      unfolded my newspapers and read reports of Arsène Lupin&rsquo;s trial, but, as
      they contained nothing that was new to me, I was not greatly interested.
      Moreover, I was tired and sleepy. I felt my eyelids close and my head
      drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, you are not going to sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized my newspaper, and looked at me with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be very imprudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struggled to keep awake. I looked through the window at the landscape
      and the fleeting clouds, but in a short time all that became confused and
      indistinct; the image of the nervous lady and the drowsy gentleman were
      effaced from my memory, and I was buried in the soothing depths of a
      profound sleep. The tranquility of my response was soon disturbed by
      disquieting dreams, wherein a creature that had played the part and bore
      the name of Arsène Lupin held an important place. He appeared to me with
      his back laden with articles of value; he leaped over walls, and plundered
      castles. But the outlines of that creature, who was no longer Arsène
      Lupin, assumed a more definite form. He came toward me, growing larger and
      larger, leaped into the compartment with incredible agility, and landed
      squarely on my chest. With a cry of fright and pain, I awoke. The man, the
      traveller, our companion, with his knee on my breast, held me by the
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sight was very indistinct, for my eyes were suffused with blood. I
      could see the lady, in a corner of the compartment, convulsed with fright.
      I tried even not to resist. Besides, I did not have the strength. My
      temples throbbed; I was almost strangled. One minute more, and I would
      have breathed my last. The man must have realized it, for he relaxed his
      grip, but did not remove his hand. Then he took a cord, in which he had
      prepared a slip-knot, and tied my wrists together. In an instant, I was
      bound, gagged, and helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, he accomplished the trick with an ease and skill that revealed
      the hand of a master; he was, no doubt, a professional thief. Not a word,
      not a nervous movement; only coolness and audacity. And I was there, lying
      on the bench, bound like a mummy, I&mdash;Arsène Lupin!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was anything but a laughing matter, and yet, despite the gravity of the
      situation, I keenly appreciated the humor and irony that it involved.
      Arsène Lupin seized and bound like a novice! robbed as if I were an
      unsophisticated rustic&mdash;for, you must understand, the scoundrel had
      deprived me of my purse and wallet! Arsène Lupin, a victim, duped,
      vanquished....What an adventure!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady did not move. He did not even notice her. He contented himself
      with picking up her traveling-bag that had fallen to the floor and taking
      from it the jewels, purse, and gold and silver trinkets that it contained.
      The lady opened her eyes, trembled with fear, drew the rings from her
      fingers and handed them to the man as if she wished to spare him
      unnecessary trouble. He took the rings and looked at her. She swooned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, quite unruffled, he resumed his seat, lighted a cigarette, and
      proceeded to examine the treasure that he had acquired. The examination
      appeared to give him perfect satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was not so well satisfied. I do not speak of the twelve thousand
      francs of which I had been unduly deprived: that was only a temporary
      loss, because I was certain that I would recover possession of that money
      after a very brief delay, together with the important papers contained in
      my wallet: plans, specifications, addresses, lists of correspondents, and
      compromising letters. But, for the moment, a more immediate and more
      serious question troubled me: How would this affair end? What would be the
      outcome of this adventure?
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can imagine, the disturbance created by my passage through the
      Saint-Lazare station has not escaped my notice. Going to visit friends who
      knew me under the name of Guillaume Berlat, and amongst whom my
      resemblance to Arsène Lupin was a subject of many innocent jests, I could
      not assume a disguise, and my presence had been remarked. So, beyond
      question, the commissary of police at Rouen, notified by telegraph, and
      assisted by numerous agents, would be awaiting the train, would question
      all suspicious passengers, and proceed to search the cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I had foreseen all that, but it had not disturbed me, as I was
      certain that the police of Rouen would not be any shrewder than the police
      of Paris and that I could escape recognition; would it not be sufficient
      for me to carelessly display my card as &ldquo;député,&rdquo; thanks to which I had
      inspired complete confidence in the gate-keeper at Saint-Lazare?&mdash;But
      the situation was greatly changed. I was no longer free. It was impossible
      to attempt one of my usual tricks. In one of the compartments, the
      commissary of police would find Mon. Arsène Lupin, bound hand and foot, as
      docile as a lamb, packed up, all ready to be dumped into a prison-van. He
      would have simply to accept delivery of the parcel, the same as if it were
      so much merchandise or a basket of fruit and vegetables. Yet, to avoid
      that shameful dénouement, what could I do?&mdash;bound and gagged, as I
      was? And the train was rushing on toward Rouen, the next and only station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another problem was presented, in which I was less interested, but the
      solution of which aroused my professional curiosity. What were the
      intentions of my rascally companion? Of course, if I had been alone, he
      could, on our arrival at Rouen, leave the car slowly and fearlessly. But
      the lady? As soon as the door of the compartment should be opened, the
      lady, now so quiet and humble, would scream and call for help. That was
      the dilemma that perplexed me! Why had he not reduced her to a helpless
      condition similar to mine? That would have given him ample time to
      disappear before his double crime was discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still smoking, with his eyes fixed upon the window that was now
      being streaked with drops of rain. Once he turned, picked up my
      time-table, and consulted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order to
      deceive the enemy. But fits of coughing, provoked by the smoke, exposed
      her true condition. As to me, I was very uncomfortable, and very tired.
      And I meditated; I plotted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was rushing on, joyously, intoxicated with its own speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint Etienne!....At that moment, the man arose and took two steps toward
      us, which caused the lady to utter a cry of alarm and fall into a genuine
      swoon. What was the man about to do? He lowered the window on our side. A
      heavy rain was now falling, and, by a gesture, the man expressed his
      annoyance at his not having an umbrella or an overcoat. He glanced at the
      rack. The lady&rsquo;s umbrella was there. He took it. He also took my overcoat
      and put it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now crossing the Seine. He turned up the bottoms of his trousers,
      then leaned over and raised the exterior latch of the door. Was he going
      to throw himself upon the track? At that speed, it would have been instant
      death. We now entered a tunnel. The man opened the door half-way and stood
      on the upper step. What folly! The darkness, the smoke, the noise, all
      gave a fantastic appearance to his actions. But suddenly, the train
      diminished its speed. A moment later it increased its speed, then slowed
      up again. Probably, some repairs were being made in that part of the
      tunnel which obliged the trains to diminish their speed, and the man was
      aware of the fact. He immediately stepped down to the lower step, closed
      the door behind him, and leaped to the ground. He was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady immediately recovered her wits, and her first act was to lament
      the loss of her jewels. I gave her an imploring look. She understood, and
      quickly removed the gag that stifled me. She wished to untie the cords
      that bound me, but I prevented her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, the police must see everything exactly as it stands. I want them
      to see what the rascal did to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I pull the alarm-bell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late. You should have done that when he made the attack on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he would have killed me. Ah! monsieur, didn&rsquo;t I tell you that he was
      on this train. I recognized him from his portrait. And now he has gone off
      with my jewels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. The police will catch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch Arsène Lupin! Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on you, madame. Listen. When we arrive at Rouen, be at the
      door and call. Make a noise. The police and the railway employees will
      come. Tell what you have seen: the assault made on me and the flight of
      Arsène Lupin. Give a description of him&mdash;soft hat, umbrella&mdash;yours&mdash;gray
      overcoat....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! mine? Not at all. It was his. I didn&rsquo;t have any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me he didn&rsquo;t have one when he came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.... unless the coat was one that some one had forgotten and left
      in the rack. At all events, he had it when he went away, and that is the
      essential point. A gray overcoat&mdash;remember!....Ah! I forgot. You must
      tell your name, first thing you do. Your husband&rsquo;s official position will
      stimulate the zeal of the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at the station. I gave her some further instructions in a
      rather imperious tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them my name&mdash;Guillaume Berlat. If necessary, say that you know
      me. That will save time. We must expedite the preliminary investigation.
      The important thing is the pursuit of Arsène Lupin. Your jewels, remember!
      Let there be no mistake. Guillaume Berlat, a friend of your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand....Guillaume Berlat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was already calling and gesticulating. As soon as the train stopped,
      several men entered the compartment. The critical moment had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panting for breath, the lady exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin.... he attacked us.... he stole my jewels....I am Madame
      Renaud.... my husband is a director of the penitentiary service....Ah!
      here is my brother, Georges Ardelle, director of the Crédit Rouennais....
      you must know....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She embraced a young man who had just joined us, and whom the commissary
      saluted. Then she continued, weeping:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Arsène Lupin.... while monsieur was sleeping, he seized him by the
      throat....Mon. Berlat, a friend of my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissary asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is Arsène Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He leaped from the train, when passing through the tunnel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that it was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I sure! I recognized him perfectly. Besides, he was seen at the
      Saint-Lazare station. He wore a soft hat&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a hard felt, like that,&rdquo; said the commissary, pointing to my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a soft hat, I am sure,&rdquo; repeated Madame Renaud, &ldquo;and a gray
      overcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is right,&rdquo; replied the commissary, &ldquo;the telegram says he wore a
      gray overcoat with a black velvet collar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, a black velvet collar,&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Renaud, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I breathed freely. Ah! the excellent friend I had in that little woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police agents had now released me. I bit my lips until they ran blood.
      Stooping over, with my handkerchief over my mouth, an attitude quite
      natural in a person who has remained for a long time in an uncomfortable
      position, and whose mouth shows the bloody marks of the gag, I addressed
      the commissary, in a weak voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it was Arsène Lupin. There is no doubt about that. If we make
      haste, he can be caught yet. I think I may be of some service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The railway car, in which the crime occurred, was detached from the train
      to serve as a mute witness at the official investigation. The train
      continued on its way to Havre. We were then conducted to the
      station-master&rsquo;s office through a crowd of curious spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, I had a sudden access of doubt and discretion. Under some pretext or
      other, I must gain my automobile, and escape. To remain there was
      dangerous. Something might happen; for instance, a telegram from Paris,
      and I would be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but what about my thief? Abandoned to my own resources, in an
      unfamiliar country, I could not hope to catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! I must make the attempt,&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;It may be a difficult
      game, but an amusing one, and the stake is well worth the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the commissary asked us to repeat the story of the robbery, I
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, really, Arsène Lupin is getting the start of us. My automobile
      is waiting in the courtyard. If you will be so kind as to use it, we can
      try....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissary smiled, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is a good one; so good, indeed, that it is already being carried
      out. Two of my men have set out on bicycles. They have been gone for some
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the entrance of the tunnel. There, they will gather evidence, secure
      witnesses, and follow on the track of Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not refrain from shrugging my shoulders, as I replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your men will not secure any evidence or any witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin will not allow anyone to see him emerge from the tunnel. He
      will take the first road&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Rouen, where we will arrest him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not go to Rouen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will remain in the vicinity, where his capture will be even more
      certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not remain in the vicinity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! And where will he hide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at my watch, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present moment, Arsène Lupin is prowling around the station at
      Darnétal. At ten fifty, that is, in twenty-two minutes from now, he will
      take the train that goes from Rouen to Amiens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? How do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is quite simple. While we were in the car, Arsène Lupin consulted
      my railway guide. Why did he do it? Was there, not far from the spot where
      he disappeared, another line of railway, a station upon that line, and a
      train stopping at that station? On consulting my railway guide, I found
      such to be the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, monsieur,&rdquo; said the commissary, &ldquo;that is a marvelous deduction. I
      congratulate you on your skill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was now convinced that I had made a mistake in displaying so much
      cleverness. The commissary regarded me with astonishment, and I thought a
      slight suspicion entered his official mind....Oh! scarcely that, for the
      photographs distributed broadcast by the police department were too
      imperfect; they presented an Arsène Lupin so different from the one he had
      before him, that he could not possibly recognize me by it. But, all the
      same, he was troubled, confused and ill-at-ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! nothing stimulates the comprehension so much as the loss of a
      pocketbook and the desire to recover it. And it seems to me that if you
      will give me two of your men, we may be able....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg of you, monsieur le commissaire,&rdquo; cried Madame Renaud, &ldquo;listen
      to Mon. Berlat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intervention of my excellent friend was decisive. Pronounced by her,
      the wife of an influential official, the name of Berlat became really my
      own, and gave me an identity that no mere suspicion could affect. The
      commissary arose, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Monsieur Berlat, I shall be delighted to see you succeed. I
      am as much interested as you are in the arrest of Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied me to the automobile, and introduced two of his men, Honoré
      Massol and Gaston Delivet, who were assigned to assist me. My chauffer
      cranked up the car and I took my place at the wheel. A few seconds later,
      we left the station. I was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! I must confess that in rolling over the boulevards that surrounded the
      old Norman city, in my swift thirty-five horse-power Moreau-Lepton, I
      experienced a deep feeling of pride, and the motor responded,
      sympathetically to my desires. At right and left, the trees flew past us
      with startling rapidity, and I, free, out of danger, had simply to arrange
      my little personal affairs with the two honest representatives of the
      Rouen police who were sitting behind me. Arsène Lupin was going in search
      of Arsène Lupin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Modest guardians of social order&mdash;Gaston Delivet and Honoré Massol&mdash;how
      valuable was your assistance! What would I have done without you? Without
      you, many times, at the cross-roads, I might have taken the wrong route!
      Without you, Arsène Lupin would have made a mistake, and the other would
      have escaped!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the end was not yet. Far from it. I had yet to capture the thief and
      recover the stolen papers. Under no circumstances must my two acolytes be
      permitted to see those papers, much less to seize them. That was a point
      that might give me some difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at Darnétal three minutes after the departure of the train.
      True, I had the consolation of learning that a man wearing a gray overcoat
      with a black velvet collar had taken the train at the station. He had
      bought a second-class ticket for Amiens. Certainly, my début as detective
      was a promising one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delivet said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train is express, and the next stop is Montérolier-Buchy in nineteen
      minutes. If we do not reach there before Arsène Lupin, he can proceed to
      Amiens, or change for the train going to Clères, and, from that point,
      reach Dieppe or Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far to Montérolier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-three kilometres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-three kilometres in nineteen minutes....We will be there ahead of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were off again! Never had my faithful Moreau-Repton responded to my
      impatience with such ardor and regularity. It participated in my anxiety.
      It indorsed my determination. It comprehended my animosity against that
      rascally Arsène Lupin. The knave! The traitor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to the right,&rdquo; cried Delivet, &ldquo;then to the left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We fairly flew, scarcely touching the ground. The mile-stones looked like
      little timid beasts that vanished at our approach. Suddenly, at a turn of
      the road, we saw a vortex of smoke. It was the Northern Express. For a
      kilometre, it was a struggle, side by side, but an unequal struggle in
      which the issue was certain. We won the race by twenty lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three seconds we were on the platform standing before the second-class
      carriages. The doors were opened, and some passengers alighted, but not my
      thief. We made a search through the compartments. No sign of Arsène Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sapristi!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;he must have recognized me in the automobile as we
      were racing, side by side, and he leaped from the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there he is now! crossing the track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started in pursuit of the man, followed by my two acolytes, or rather
      followed by one of them, for the other, Massol, proved himself to be a
      runner of exceptional speed and endurance. In a few moments, he had made
      an appreciable gain upon the fugitive. The man noticed it, leaped over a
      hedge, scampered across a meadow, and entered a thick grove. When we
      reached this grove, Massol was waiting for us. He went no farther, for
      fear of losing us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, my dear friend,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;After such a run, our victim must
      be out of wind. We will catch him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone in the
      arrest of the fugitive, in order to recover my papers, concerning which
      the authorities would doubtless ask many disagreeable questions. Then I
      returned to my companions, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all quite easy. You, Massol, take your place at the left; you,
      Delivet, at the right. From there, you can observe the entire posterior
      line of the bush, and he cannot escape without you seeing him, except by
      that ravine, and I shall watch it. If he does not come out voluntarily, I
      will enter and drive him out toward one or the other of you. You have
      simply to wait. Ah! I forgot: in case I need you, a pistol shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Massol and Delivet walked away to their respective posts. As soon as they
      had disappeared, I entered the grove with the greatest precaution so as to
      be neither seen nor heard. I encountered dense thickets, through which
      narrow paths had been cut, but the overhanging boughs compelled me to
      adopt a stooping posture. One of these paths led to a clearing in which I
      found footsteps upon the wet grass. I followed them; they led me to the
      foot of a mound which was surmounted by a deserted, dilapidated hovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be there,&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;It is a well-chosen retreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I crept cautiously to the side of the building. A slight noise informed me
      that he was there; and, then, through an opening, I saw him. His back was
      turned toward me. In two bounds, I was upon him. He tried to fire a
      revolver that he held in his hand. But he had no time. I threw him to the
      ground, in such a manner that his arms were beneath him, twisted and
      helpless, whilst I held him down with my knee on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my boy,&rdquo; I whispered in his ear. &ldquo;I am Arsène Lupin. You are to
      deliver over to me, immediately and gracefully, my pocketbook and the
      lady&rsquo;s jewels, and, in return therefore, I will save you from the police
      and enroll you amongst my friends. One word: yes or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Your escape, this morning, was well planned. I congratulate
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I arose. He fumbled in his pocket, drew out a large knife and tried to
      strike me with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imbecile!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one hand, I parried the attack; with the other, I gave him a sharp
      blow on the carotid artery. He fell&mdash;stunned!
    </p>
    <p>
      In my pocketbook, I recovered my papers and bank-notes. Out of curiosity,
      I took his. Upon an envelope, addressed to him, I read his name: Pierre
      Onfrey. It startled me. Pierre Onfrey, the assassin of the rue Lafontaine
      at Auteuil! Pierre Onfrey, he who had cut the throats of Madame Delbois
      and her two daughters. I leaned over him. Yes, those were the features
      which, in the compartment, had evoked in me the memory of a face I could
      not then recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time was passing. I placed in an envelope two bank-notes of one
      hundred francs each, with a card bearing these words: &ldquo;Arsène Lupin to his
      worthy colleagues Honoré Massol and Gaston Delivet, as a slight token of
      his gratitude.&rdquo; I placed it in a prominent spot in the room, where they
      would be sure to find it. Beside it, I placed Madame Renaud&rsquo;s handbag. Why
      could I not return it to the lady who had befriended me? I must confess
      that I had taken from it everything that possessed any interest or value,
      leaving there only a shell comb, a stick of rouge Dorin for the lips, and
      an empty purse. But, you know, business is business. And then, really, her
      husband is engaged in such a dishonorable vocation!
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was becoming conscious. What was I to do? I was unable to save him
      or condemn him. So I took his revolver and fired a shot in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My two acolytes will come and attend to his case,&rdquo; I said to myself, as I
      hastened away by the road through the ravine. Twenty minutes later, I was
      seated in my automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock, I telegraphed to my friends at Rouen that an unexpected
      event would prevent me from making my promised visit. Between ourselves,
      considering what my friends must now know, my visit is postponed
      indefinitely. A cruel disillusion for them!
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock I was in Paris. The evening newspapers informed me that
      Pierre Onfrey had been captured at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day,&mdash;let us not despise the advantages of judicious
      advertising,&mdash;the &lsquo;Echo de France&rsquo; published this sensational item:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, near Buchy, after numerous exciting incidents, Arsène Lupin
      effected the arrest of Pierre Onfrey. The assassin of the rue Lafontaine
      had robbed Madame Renaud, wife of the director in the penitentiary
      service, in a railway carriage on the Paris-Havre line. Arsène Lupin
      restored to Madame Renaud the hand-bag that contained her jewels, and gave
      a generous recompense to the two detectives who had assisted him in making
      that dramatic arrest.&rdquo;

      V. The Queen&rsquo;s Necklace
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two or three times each year, on occasions of unusual importance, such as
      the balls at the Austrian Embassy or the soirées of Lady Billingstone, the
      Countess de Dreux-Soubise wore upon her white shoulders &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s
      Necklace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, the famous necklace, the legendary necklace that Bohmer
      and Bassenge, court jewelers, had made for Madame Du Barry; the veritable
      necklace that the Cardinal de Rohan-Soubise intended to give to
      Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France; and the same that the adventuress
      Jeanne de Valois, Countess de la Motte, had pulled to pieces one evening
      in February, 1785, with the aid of her husband and their accomplice,
      Rétaux de Villette.
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, the mounting alone was genuine. Rétaux de Villette had
      kept it, whilst the Count de la Motte and his wife scattered to the four
      winds of heaven the beautiful stones so carefully chosen by Bohmer. Later,
      he sold the mounting to Gaston de Dreux-Soubise, nephew and heir of the
      Cardinal, who re-purchased the few diamonds that remained in the
      possession of the English jeweler, Jeffreys; supplemented them with other
      stones of the same size but of much inferior quality, and thus restored
      the marvelous necklace to the form in which it had come from the hands of
      Bohmer and Bassenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly a century, the house of Dreux-Soubise had prided itself upon
      the possession of this historic jewel. Although adverse circumstances had
      greatly reduced their fortune, they preferred to curtail their household
      expenses rather than part with this relic of royalty. More particularly,
      the present count clung to it as a man clings to the home of his
      ancestors. As a matter of prudence, he had rented a safety-deposit box at
      the Crédit Lyonnais in which to keep it. He went for it himself on the
      afternoon of the day on which his wife wished to wear it, and he, himself,
      carried it back next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular evening, at the reception given at the Palais de
      Castille, the Countess achieved a remarkable success; and King Christian,
      in whose honor the fête was given, commented on her grace and beauty. The
      thousand facets of the diamond sparkled and shone like flames of fire
      about her shapely neck and shoulders, and it is safe to say that none but
      she could have borne the weight of such an ornament with so much ease and
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a double triumph, and the Count de Dreux was highly elated when
      they returned to their chamber in the old house of the faubourg
      Saint-Germain. He was proud of his wife, and quite as proud, perhaps, of
      the necklace that had conferred added luster to his noble house for
      generations. His wife, also, regarded the necklace with an almost childish
      vanity, and it was not without regret that she removed it from her
      shoulders and handed it to her husband who admired it as passionately as
      if he had never seen it before. Then, having placed it in its case of red
      leather, stamped with the Cardinal&rsquo;s arms, he passed into an adjoining
      room which was simply an alcove or cabinet that had been cut off from
      their chamber, and which could be entered only by means of a door at the
      foot of their bed. As he had done on previous occasions, he hid it on a
      high shelf amongst hat-boxes and piles of linen. He closed the door, and
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, he arose about nine o&rsquo;clock, intending to go to the Crédit
      Lyonnais before breakfast. He dressed, drank a cup of coffee, and went to
      the stables to give his orders. The condition of one of the horses worried
      him. He caused it to be exercised in his presence. Then he returned to his
      wife, who had not yet left the chamber. Her maid was dressing her hair.
      When her husband entered, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as far as the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. That is wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He entered the cabinet; but, after a few seconds, and without any sign of
      astonishment, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you take it, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?....No, I have not taken anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have moved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I have not even opened that door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He appeared at the door, disconcerted, and stammered, in a scarcely
      intelligible voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t....It wasn&rsquo;t you?....Then....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hastened to his assistance, and, together, they made a thorough
      search, throwing the boxes to the floor and overturning the piles of
      linen. Then the count said, quite discouraged:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless to look any more. I put it here, on this shelf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it was on this shelf&mdash;nowhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lighted a candle, as the room was quite dark, and then carried out
      all the linen and other articles that the room contained. And, when the
      room was emptied, they confessed, in despair, that the famous necklace had
      disappeared. Without losing time in vain lamentations, the countess
      notified the commissary of police, Mon. Valorbe, who came at once, and,
      after hearing their story, inquired of the count:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that no one passed through your chamber during the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely sure, as I am a very light sleeper. Besides, the chamber door
      was bolted, and I remember unbolting it this morning when my wife rang for
      her maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is no other entrance to the cabinet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No windows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it is closed up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Candles were lighted, and Mon. Valorbe observed at once that the lower
      half of the window was covered by a large press which was, however, so
      narrow that it did not touch the casement on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what does this window open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small inner court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have a floor above this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two; but, on a level with the servant&rsquo;s floor, there is a close grating
      over the court. That is why this room is so dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the press was moved, they found that the window was fastened, which
      would not have been the case if anyone had entered that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;they went out through our chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, you would have found the door unbolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissary considered the situation for a moment, then asked the
      countess:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any of your servants know that you wore the necklace last evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; I didn&rsquo;t conceal the fact. But nobody knew that it was hidden
      in that cabinet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one.... unless....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite sure, madam, as it is a very important point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to her husband, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of Henriette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henriette? She didn&rsquo;t know where we kept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this woman Henriette?&rdquo; asked Mon. Valorbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A school-mate, who was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her.
      After her husband&rsquo;s death, I furnished an apartment in this house for her
      and her son. She is clever with her needle and has done some work for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What floor is she on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same as ours.... at the end of the corridor.... and I think.... the
      window of her kitchen....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Opens on this little court, does it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just opposite ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mon. Valorbe then asked to see Henriette. They went to her apartment; she
      was sewing, whilst her son Raoul, about six years old, was sitting beside
      her, reading. The commissary was surprised to see the wretched apartment
      that had been provided for the woman. It consisted of one room without a
      fireplace, and a very small room that served as a kitchen. The commissary
      proceeded to question her. She appeared to be overwhelmed on learning of
      the theft. Last evening she had herself dressed the countess and placed
      the necklace upon her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no idea? Not the least suspicion? Is it possible that the
      thief may have passed through your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed heartily, never supposing that she could be an object of
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have not left my room. I never go out. And, perhaps, you have not
      seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the kitchen window, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, it is at least three metres to the ledge of the opposite window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that we supposed the theft might have been committed in that
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But.... the necklace was in the cabinet, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have always known that it was kept there at night. It had been
      mentioned in my presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face, though still young, bore unmistakable traces of sorrow and
      resignation. And it now assumed an expression of anxiety as if some danger
      threatened her. She drew her son toward her. The child took her hand, and
      kissed it affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone again, the count said to the commissary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not suppose you suspect Henriette. I can answer for her. She is
      honesty itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; replied Mon. Valorbe. &ldquo;At most, I thought there
      might have been an unconscious complicity. But I confess that even that
      theory must be abandoned, as it does not help solve the problem now before
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissary of police abandoned the investigation, which was now taken
      up and completed by the examining judge. He questioned the servants,
      examined the condition of the bolt, experimented with the opening and
      closing of the cabinet window, and explored the little court from top to
      bottom. All was in vain. The bolt was intact. The window could not be
      opened or closed from the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiries especially concerned Henriette, for, in spite of everything,
      they always turned in her direction. They made a thorough investigation of
      her past life, and ascertained that, during the last three years, she had
      left the house only four times, and her business, on those occasions, was
      satisfactorily explained. As a matter of fact, she acted as chambermaid
      and seamstress to the countess, who treated her with great strictness and
      even severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a week, the examining judge had secured no more definite
      information than the commissary of police. The judge said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitting that we know the guilty party, which we do not, we are
      confronted by the fact that we do not know how the theft was committed. We
      are brought face to face with two obstacles: a door and a window&mdash;both
      closed and fastened. It is thus a double mystery. How could anyone enter,
      and, moreover, how could any one escape, leaving behind him a bolted door
      and a fastened window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of four months, the secret opinion of the judge was that the
      count and countess, being hard pressed for money, which was their normal
      condition, had sold the Queen&rsquo;s Necklace. He closed the investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of the famous jewel was a severe blow to the Dreux-Soubise. Their
      credit being no longer propped up by the reserve fund that such a treasure
      constituted, they found themselves confronted by more exacting creditors
      and money-lenders. They were obliged to cut down to the quick, to sell or
      mortgage every article that possessed any commercial value. In brief, it
      would have been their ruin, if two large legacies from some distant
      relatives had not saved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their pride also suffered a downfall, as if they had lost a quartering
      from their escutcheon. And, strange to relate, it was upon her former
      schoolmate, Henriette, that the countess vented her spleen. Toward her,
      the countess displayed the most spiteful feelings, and even openly accused
      her. First, Henriette was relegated to the servants&rsquo; quarters, and, next
      day, discharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time, the count and countess passed an uneventful life. They
      traveled a great deal. Only one incident of record occurred during that
      period. Some months after the departure of Henriette, the countess was
      surprised when she received and read the following letter, signed by
      Henriette:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;I do not know how to thank you; for it was you, was it not, who
      sent me that? It could not have been anyone else. No one but you knows
      where I live. If I am wrong, excuse me, and accept my sincere thanks for
      your past favors....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did the letter mean? The present or past favors of the countess
      consisted principally of injustice and neglect. Why, then, this letter of
      thanks?
    </p>
    <p>
      When asked for an explanation, Henriette replied that she had received a
      letter, through the mails, enclosing two bank-notes of one thousand francs
      each. The envelope, which she enclosed with her reply, bore the Paris
      post-mark, and was addressed in a handwriting that was obviously
      disguised. Now, whence came those two thousand francs? Who had sent them?
      And why had they sent them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Henriette received a similar letter and a like sum of money twelve months
      later. And a third time; and a fourth; and each year for a period of six
      years, with this difference, that in the fifth and sixth years the sum was
      doubled. There was another difference: the post-office authorities having
      seized one of the letters under the pretext that it was not registered,
      the last two letters were duly sent according to the postal regulations,
      the first dated from Saint-Germain, the other from Suresnes. The writer
      signed the first one, &ldquo;Anquety&rdquo;; and the other, &ldquo;Péchard.&rdquo; The addresses
      that he gave were false.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of six years, Henriette died, and the mystery remained
      unsolved.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      All these events are known to the public. The case was one of those which
      excite public interest, and it was a strange coincidence that this
      necklace, which had caused such a great commotion in France at the close
      of the eighteenth century, should create a similar commotion a century
      later. But what I am about to relate is known only to the parties directly
      interested and a few others from whom the count exacted a promise of
      secrecy. As it is probable that some day or other that promise will be
      broken, I have no hesitation in rending the veil and thus disclosing the
      key to the mystery, the explanation of the letter published in the morning
      papers two days ago; an extraordinary letter which increased, if possible,
      the mists and shadows that envelope this inscrutable drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days ago, a number of guests were dining with the Count de
      Dreux-Soubise. There were several ladies present, including his two nieces
      and his cousin, and the following gentlemen: the president of Essaville,
      the deputy Bochas, the chevalier Floriani, whom the count had known in
      Sicily, and General Marquis de Rouzières, an old club friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the repast, coffee was served by the ladies, who gave the gentlemen
      permission to smoke their cigarettes, provided they would not desert the
      salon. The conversation was general, and finally one of the guests chanced
      to speak of celebrated crimes. And that gave the Marquis de Rouzières, who
      delighted to tease the count, an opportunity to mention the affair of the
      Queen&rsquo;s Necklace, a subject that the count detested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one expressed his own opinion of the affair; and, of course, their
      various theories were not only contradictory but impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, monsieur,&rdquo; said the countess to the chevalier Floriani, &ldquo;what is
      your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&mdash;I have no opinion, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the guests protested; for the chevalier had just related in an
      entertaining manner various adventures in which he had participated with
      his father, a magistrate at Palermo, and which established his judgment
      and taste in such manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have sometimes succeeded in unraveling mysteries
      that the cleverest detectives have renounced; yet I do not claim to be
      Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, I know very little about the affair of the
      Queen&rsquo;s Necklace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody now turned to the count, who was thus obliged, quite
      unwillingly, to narrate all the circumstances connected with the theft.
      The chevalier listened, reflected, asked a few questions, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very strange.... at first sight, the problem appears to be a very
      simple one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count shrugged his shoulders. The others drew closer to the chevalier,
      who continued, in a dogmatic tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a general rule, in order to find the author of a crime or a theft, it
      is necessary to determine how that crime or theft was committed, or, at
      least, how it could have been committed. In the present case, nothing is
      more simple, because we are face to face, not with several theories, but
      with one positive fact, that is to say: the thief could only enter by the
      chamber door or the window of the cabinet. Now, a person cannot open a
      bolted door from the outside. Therefore, he must have entered through the
      window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was closed and fastened, and we found it fastened afterward,&rdquo;
       declared the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to do that,&rdquo; continued Floriani, without heeding the
      interruption, &ldquo;he had simply to construct a bridge, a plank or a ladder,
      between the balcony of the kitchen and the ledge of the window, and as the
      jewel-case&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I repeat that the window was fastened,&rdquo; exclaimed the count,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, Floriani was obliged to reply. He did so with the greatest
      tranquility, as if the objection was the most insignificant affair in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will admit that it was; but is there not a transom in the upper part of
      the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, that was customary in houses of that date; and, in
      the second place, without such a transom, the theft cannot be explained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is one, but it was closed, the same as the window.
      Consequently, we did not pay attention to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a mistake; for, if you had examined it, you would have found
      that it had been opened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume that, like all others, it opens by means of a wire with a ring
      on the lower end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I do not see&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, through a hole in the window, a person could, by the aid of some
      instrument, let us say a poker with a hook at the end, grip the ring, pull
      down, and open the transom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count laughed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! excellent! Your scheme is very cleverly constructed, but you
      overlook one thing, monsieur, there is no hole in the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, we would have seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to see it, you must look for it, and no one has looked. The hole
      is there; it must be there, at the side of the window, in the putty. In a
      vertical direction, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count arose. He was greatly excited. He paced up and down the room,
      two or three times, in a nervous manner; then, approaching Floriani, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has been in that room since; nothing has been changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, monsieur, you can easily satisfy yourself that my explanation
      is correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not agree with the facts established by the examining judge. You
      have seen nothing, and yet you contradict all that we have seen and all
      that we know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floriani paid no attention to the count&rsquo;s petulance. He simply smiled and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu, monsieur, I submit my theory; that is all. If I am mistaken,
      you can easily prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so at once....I confess that your assurance&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count muttered a few more words; then suddenly rushed to the door and
      passed out. Not a word was uttered in his absence; and this profound
      silence gave the situation an air of almost tragic importance. Finally,
      the count returned. He was pale and nervous. He said to his friends, in a
      trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon.... the revelations of the chevalier were so
      unexpected....I should never have thought....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife questioned him, eagerly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak.... what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stammered: &ldquo;The hole is there, at the very spot, at the side of the
      window&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized the chevalier&rsquo;s arm, and said to him in an imperious tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, monsieur, proceed. I admit that you are right so far, but now....
      that is not all.... go on.... tell us the rest of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floriani disengaged his arm gently, and, after a moment, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in my opinion, this is what happened. The thief, knowing that the
      countess was going to wear the necklace that evening, had prepared his
      gangway or bridge during your absence. He watched you through the window
      and saw you hide the necklace. Afterward, he cut the glass and pulled the
      ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but the distance was so great that it would be impossible for him to
      reach the window-fastening through the transom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, if he could not open the window by reaching through the
      transom, he must have crawled through the transom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible; it is too small. No man could crawl through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was not a man,&rdquo; declared Floriani.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the transom is too small to admit a man, it must have been a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not say that your friend Henriette had a son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a son named Raoul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in all probability, it was Raoul who committed the theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof have you of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof! Plenty of it....For instance&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and reflected for a moment, then continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance, that gangway or bridge. It is improbable that the child
      could have brought it in from outside the house and carried it away again
      without being observed. He must have used something close at hand. In the
      little room used by Henriette as a kitchen, were there not some shelves
      against the wall on which she placed her pans and dishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two shelves, to the best of my memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that those shelves are really fastened to the wooden
      brackets that support them? For, if they are not, we could be justified in
      presuming that the child removed them, fastened them together, and thus
      formed his bridge. Perhaps, also, since there was a stove, we might find
      the bent poker that he used to open the transom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without saying a word, the count left the room; and, this time, those
      present did not feel the nervous anxiety they had experienced the first
      time. They were confident that Floriani was right, and no one was
      surprised when the count returned and declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the child. Everything proves it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen the shelves and the poker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The shelves have been unnailed, and the poker is there yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the countess exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better say it was his mother. Henriette is the guilty party. She
      must have compelled her son&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; declared the chevalier, &ldquo;the mother had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! they occupied the same room. The child could not have done it
      without the mother&rsquo;s knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, they lived in the same room, but all this happened in the adjoining
      room, during the night, while the mother was asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the necklace?&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;It would have been found amongst the
      child&rsquo;s things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me! He had been out. That morning, on which you found him reading,
      he had just come from school, and perhaps the commissary of police,
      instead of wasting his time on the innocent mother, would have been better
      employed in searching the child&rsquo;s desk amongst his school-books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you explain those two thousand francs that Henriette received
      each year? Are they not evidence of her complicity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she had been an accomplice, would she have thanked you for that money?
      And then, was she not closely watched? But the child, being free, could
      easily go to a neighboring city, negotiate with some dealer and sell him
      one diamond or two diamonds, as he might wish, upon condition that the
      money should be sent from Paris, and that proceeding could be repeated
      from year to year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An indescribable anxiety oppressed the Dreux-Soubise and their guests.
      There was something in the tone and attitude of Floriani&mdash;something
      more than the chevalier&rsquo;s assurance which, from the beginning, had so
      annoyed the count. There was a touch of irony, that seemed rather hostile
      than sympathetic. But the count affected to laugh, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is very ingenious and interesting, and I congratulate you upon
      your vivid imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; replied Floriani, with the utmost gravity, &ldquo;I imagine
      nothing. I simply describe the events as they must have occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you know about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you yourself have told me. I picture to myself the life of the
      mother and child down there in the country; the illness of the mother, the
      schemes of and inventions of the child to sell the precious stones in order
      to save his mother&rsquo;s life, or, at least, soothe her dying moments. Her
      illness overcomes her. She dies. Years roll on. The child becomes a man;
      and then&mdash;and now I will give my imagination a free rein&mdash;let us
      suppose that the man feels a desire to return to the home of his
      childhood, that he does so, and that he meets there certain people who
      suspect and accuse his mother.... do you realize the sorrow and anguish of
      such an interview in the very house wherein the original drama was
      played?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words seemed to echo for a few seconds in the ensuing silence, and one
      could read upon the faces of the Count and Countess de Dreux a bewildered
      effort to comprehend his meaning and, at the same time, the fear and
      anguish of such a comprehension. The count spoke at last, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? The chevalier Floriani, whom you met at Palermo, and whom you have
      been gracious enough to invite to your house on several occasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what does this story mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing at all! It is simply a pastime, so far as I am concerned. I
      endeavor to depict the pleasure that Henriette&rsquo;s son, if he still lives,
      would have in telling you that he was the guilty party, and that he did it
      because his mother was unhappy, as she was on the point of losing the
      place of a.... servant, by which she lived, and because the child suffered
      at sight of his mother&rsquo;s sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with suppressed emotion, rose partially and inclined toward the
      countess. There could be no doubt that the chevalier Floriani was
      Henriette&rsquo;s son. His attitude and words proclaimed it. Besides, was it not
      his obvious intention and desire to be recognized as such?
    </p>
    <p>
      The count hesitated. What action would he take against the audacious
      guest? Ring? Provoke a scandal? Unmask the man who had once robbed him?
      But that was a long time ago! And who would believe that absurd story
      about the guilty child? No; better far to accept the situation, and
      pretend not to comprehend the true meaning of it. So the count, turning to
      Floriani, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story is very curious, very entertaining; I enjoyed it much. But
      what do you think has become of this young man, this model son? I hope he
      has not abandoned the career in which he made such a brilliant début.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After such a début! To steal the Queen&rsquo;s Necklace at six years of age;
      the celebrated necklace that was coveted by Marie-Antoinette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to steal it,&rdquo; remarked Floriani, falling in with the count&rsquo;s mood,
      &ldquo;without costing him the slightest trouble, without anyone thinking to
      examine the condition of the window, or to observe that the window-sill
      was too clean&mdash;that window-sill which he had wiped in order to efface
      the marks he had made in the thick dust. We must admit that it was
      sufficient to turn the head of a boy at that age. It was all so easy. He
      had simply to desire the thing, and reach out his hand to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he reached out his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both hands,&rdquo; replied the chevalier, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions received a shock. What mystery surrounded the life of the
      so-called Floriani? How wonderful must have been the life of that
      adventurer, a thief at six years of age, and who, to-day, in search of
      excitement or, at most, to gratify a feeling of resentment, had come to
      brave his victim in her own house, audaciously, foolishly, and yet with
      all the grace and delicacy of a courteous guest!
    </p>
    <p>
      He arose and approached the countess to bid her adieu. She recoiled,
      unconsciously. He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Madame, you are afraid of me! Did I pursue my role of parlor-magician
      a step too far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She controlled herself, and replied, with her accustomed ease:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, monsieur. The legend of that dutiful son interested me very
      much, and I am pleased to know that my necklace had such a brilliant
      destiny. But do you not think that the son of that woman, that Henriette,
      was the victim of hereditary influence in the choice of his vocation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered, feeling the point, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it; and, moreover, his natural tendency to crime must have
      been very strong or he would have been discouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, as you must know, the majority of the diamonds were false. The
      only genuine stones were the few purchased from the English jeweler, the
      others having been sold, one by one, to meet the cruel necessities of
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was still the Queen&rsquo;s Necklace, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the countess,
      haughtily, &ldquo;and that is something that he, Henriette&rsquo;s son, could not
      appreciate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was able to appreciate, madame, that, whether true or false, the
      necklace was nothing more that an object of parade, an emblem of senseless
      pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count made a threatening gesture, but his wife stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if the man to whom you allude has the slightest
      sense of honor&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, intimidated by Floriani&rsquo;s cool manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that man has the slightest sense of honor,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she would not gain anything by speaking to him in that
      manner, and in spite of her anger and indignation, trembling as she was
      from humiliated pride, she said to him, almost politely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, the legend says that Rétaux de Villette, when in possession of
      the Queen&rsquo;s Necklace, did not disfigure the mounting. He understood that
      the diamonds were simply the ornament, the accessory, and that the
      mounting was the essential work, the creation of the artist, and he
      respected it accordingly. Do you think that this man had the same
      feeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt that the mounting still exists. The child respected it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, if you should happen to meet him, will you tell him that
      he unjustly keeps possession of a relic that is the property and pride of
      a certain family, and that, although the stones have been removed, the
      Queen&rsquo;s necklace still belongs to the house of Dreux-Soubise. It belongs
      to us as much as our name or our honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier replied, simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell him, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to her, saluted the count and the other guests, and departed.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Four days later, the countess de Dreux found upon the table in her chamber
      a red leather case bearing the cardinal&rsquo;s arms. She opened it, and found
      the Queen&rsquo;s Necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as all things must, in the life of a man who strives for unity and
      logic, converge toward the same goal&mdash;and as a little advertising
      never does any harm&mdash;on the following day, the &lsquo;Echo de France&rsquo;
      published these sensational lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Necklace, the famous historical jewelry stolen from the
      family of Dreux-Soubise, has been recovered by Arsène Lupin, who hastened
      to restore it to its rightful owner. We cannot too highly commend such a
      delicate and chivalrous act.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VI. The Seven of Hearts
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am frequently asked this question: &ldquo;How did you make the acquaintance of
      Arsène Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My connection with Arsène Lupin was well known. The details that I gather
      concerning that mysterious man, the irrefutable facts that I present, the
      new evidence that I produce, the interpretation that I place on certain
      acts of which the public has seen only the exterior manifestations without
      being able to discover the secret reasons or the invisible mechanism, all
      establish, if not an intimacy, at least amicable relations and regular
      confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how did I make his acquaintance? Why was I selected to be his
      historiographer? Why I, and not some one else?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is simple: chance alone presided over my choice; my merit was
      not considered. It was chance that put me in his way. It was by chance
      that I was participant in one of his strangest and most mysterious
      adventures; and by chance that I was an actor in a drama of which he was
      the marvelous stage director; an obscure and intricate drama, bristling
      with such thrilling events that I feel a certain embarrassment in
      undertaking to describe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act takes place during that memorable night of 22 June, of which
      so much has already been said. And, for my part, I attribute the anomalous
      conduct of which I was guilty on that occasion to the unusual frame of
      mind in which I found myself on my return home. I had dined with some
      friends at the Cascade restaurant, and, the entire evening, whilst we
      smoked and the orchestra played melancholy waltzes, we talked only of
      crimes and thefts, and dark and frightful intrigues. That is always a poor
      overture to a night&rsquo;s sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Saint-Martins went away in an automobile. Jean Daspry&mdash;that
      delightful, heedless Daspry who, six months later, was killed in such a
      tragic manner on the frontier of Morocco&mdash;Jean Daspry and I returned
      on foot through the dark, warm night. When we arrived in front of the
      little house in which I had lived for a year at Neuilly, on the boulevard
      Maillot, he said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this house is so isolated.... no neighbors.... vacant lots....Really,
      I am not a coward, and yet&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are very cheering, I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I say that as I would say anything else. The Saint-Martins have
      impressed me with their stories of brigands and thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook hands and said good-night. I took out my key and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is good,&rdquo; I murmured, &ldquo;Antoine has forgotten to light a
      candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I recalled the fact that Antoine was away; I had given him a short
      leave of absence. Forthwith, I was disagreeably oppressed by the darkness
      and silence of the night. I ascended the stairs on tiptoe, and reached my
      room as quickly as possible; then, contrary to my usual habit, I turned
      the key and pushed the bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of my candle restored my courage. Yet I was careful to take my
      revolver from its case&mdash;a large, powerful weapon&mdash;and place it
      beside my bed. That precaution completed my reassurance. I laid down and,
      as usual, took a book from my night-table to read myself to sleep. Then I
      received a great surprise. Instead of the paper-knife with which I had
      marked my place on the preceding, I found an envelope, closed with five
      seals of red wax. I seized it eagerly. It was addressed to me, and marked:
      &ldquo;Urgent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A letter! A letter addressed to me! Who could have put it in that place?
      Nervously, I tore open the envelope, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the moment you open this letter, whatever happens, whatever you may
      hear, do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise you are doomed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am not a coward, and, quite as well as another, I can face real danger,
      or smile at the visionary perils of imagination. But, let me repeat, I was
      in an anomalous condition of mind, with my nerves set on edge by the
      events of the evening. Besides, was there not, in my present situation,
      something startling and mysterious, calculated to disturb the most
      courageous spirit?
    </p>
    <p>
      My feverish fingers clutched the sheet of paper, and I read and re-read
      those threatening words: &ldquo;Do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise,
      you are doomed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;It is a joke; the work of some cheerful idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was about to laugh&mdash;a good loud laugh. Who prevented me? What
      haunting fear compressed my throat?
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, I would blow out the candle. No, I could not do it. &ldquo;Do not
      move, or you are doomed,&rdquo; were the words he had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      These auto-suggestions are frequently more imperious than the most
      positive realities; but why should I struggle against them? I had simply
      to close my eyes. I did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, I heard a slight noise, followed by crackling sounds,
      proceeding from a large room used by me as a library. A small room or
      antechamber was situated between the library and my bedchamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach of an actual danger greatly excited me, and I felt a desire
      to get up, seize my revolver, and rush into the library. I did not rise; I
      saw one of the curtains of the left window move. There was no doubt about
      it: the curtain had moved. It was still moving. And I saw&mdash;oh! I saw
      quite distinctly&mdash;in the narrow space between the curtains and the
      window, a human form; a bulky mass that prevented the curtains from
      hanging straight. And it is equally certain that the man saw me through
      the large meshes of the curtain. Then, I understood the situation. His
      mission was to guard me while the others carried away their booty. Should
      I rise and seize my revolver? Impossible! He was there! At the least
      movement, at the least cry, I was doomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a terrific noise that shook the house; this was followed by
      lighter sounds, two or three together, like those of a hammer that
      rebounded. At least, that was the impression formed in my confused brain.
      These were mingled with other sounds, thus creating a veritable uproar
      which proved that the intruders were not only bold, but felt themselves
      secure from interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were right. I did not move. Was it cowardice? No, rather weakness, a
      total inability to move any portion of my body, combined with discretion;
      for why should I struggle? Behind that man, there were ten others who
      would come to his assistance. Should I risk my life to save a few
      tapestries and bibelots?
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the night, my torture endured. Insufferable torture, terrible
      anguish! The noises had stopped, but I was in constant fear of their
      renewal. And the man! The man who was guarding me, weapon in hand. My
      fearful eyes remained cast in his direction. And my heart beat! And a
      profuse perspiration oozed from every pore of my body!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, I experienced an immense relief; a milk-wagon, whose sound was
      familiar to me, passed along the boulevard; and, at the same time, I had
      an impression that the light of a new day was trying to steal through the
      closed window-blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, daylight penetrated the room; other vehicles passed along the
      boulevard; and all the phantoms of the night vanished. Then I put one arm
      out of the bed, slowly and cautiously. My eyes were fixed upon the
      curtain, locating the exact spot at which I must fire; I made an exact
      calculation of the movements I must make; then, quickly, I seized my
      revolver and fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaped from my bed with a cry of deliverance, and rushed to the window.
      The bullet had passed through the curtain and the window-glass, but it had
      not touched the man&mdash;for the very good reason that there was none
      there. Nobody! Thus, during the entire night, I had been hypnotized by a
      fold of the curtain. And, during that time, the malefactors....Furiously,
      with an enthusiasm that nothing could have stopped, I turned the key,
      opened the door, crossed the antechamber, opened another door, and rushed
      into the library. But amazement stopped me on the threshold, panting,
      astounded, more astonished than I had been by the absence of the man. All
      the things that I supposed had been stolen, furniture, books, pictures,
      old tapestries, everything was in its proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was incredible. I could not believe my eyes. Notwithstanding that
      uproar, those noises of removal....I made a tour, I inspected the walls, I
      made a mental inventory of all the familiar objects. Nothing was missing.
      And, what was more disconcerting, there was no clue to the intruders, not
      a sign, not a chair disturbed, not the trace of a footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Well!&rdquo; I said to myself, pressing my hands on my bewildered head,
      &ldquo;surely I am not crazy! I heard something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inch by inch, I made a careful examination of the room. It was in vain.
      Unless I could consider this as a discovery: Under a small Persian rug, I
      found a card&mdash;an ordinary playing card. It was the seven of hearts;
      it was like any other seven of hearts in French playing-cards, with this
      slight but curious exception: The extreme point of each of the seven red
      spots or hearts was pierced by a hole, round and regular as if made with
      the point of an awl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more. A card and a letter found in a book. But was not that
      sufficient to affirm that I had not been the plaything of a dream?
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Throughout the day, I continued my searches in the library. It was a large
      room, much too large for the requirements of such a house, and the
      decoration of which attested the bizarre taste of its founder. The floor
      was a mosaic of multicolored stones, formed into large symmetrical
      designs. The walls were covered with a similar mosaic, arranged in panels,
      Pompeiian allegories, Byzantine compositions, frescoes of the Middle Ages.
      A Bacchus bestriding a cask. An emperor wearing a gold crown, a flowing
      beard, and holding a sword in his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite high, after the style of an artist&rsquo;s studio, there was a large
      window&mdash;the only one in the room. That window being always open at
      night, it was probable that the men had entered through it, by the aid of
      a ladder. But, again, there was no evidence. The bottom of the ladder
      would have left some marks in the soft earth beneath the window; but there
      were none. Nor were there any traces of footsteps in any part of the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no idea of informing the police, because the facts I had before me
      were so absurd and inconsistent. They would laugh at me. However, as I was
      then a reporter on the staff of the &lsquo;Gil Blas,&rsquo; I wrote a lengthy account
      of my adventure and it was published in the paper on the second day
      thereafter. The article attracted some attention, but no one took it
      seriously. They regarded it as a work of fiction rather than a story of
      real life. The Saint-Martins rallied me. But Daspry, who took an interest
      in such matters, came to see me, made a study of the affair, but reached
      no conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few mornings later, the door-bell rang, and Antoine came to inform me
      that a gentleman desired to see me. He would not give his name. I directed
      Antoine to show him up. He was a man of about forty years of age with a
      very dark complexion, lively features, and whose correct dress, slightly
      frayed, proclaimed a taste that contrasted strangely with his rather
      vulgar manners. Without any preamble, he said to me&mdash;in a rough voice
      that confirmed my suspicion as to his social position:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, whilst in a café, I picked up a copy of the &lsquo;Gil Blas,&rsquo; and
      read your article. It interested me very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to talk to you. Are all the facts related by you quite correct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in that case, I can, perhaps, give you some information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. First, I must be sure that the facts are exactly as you have
      related them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given you my word. What further proof do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must remain alone in this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; I said, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea that occurred to me when reading your article. Certain
      details established an extraordinary coincidence with another case that
      came under my notice. If I am mistaken, I shall say nothing more. And the
      only means of ascertaining the truth is by my remaining in the room
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was at the bottom of this proposition? Later, I recalled that the man
      was exceedingly nervous; but, at the same time, although somewhat
      astonished, I found nothing particularly abnormal about the man or the
      request he had made. Moreover, my curiosity was aroused; so I replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. How much time do you require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! three minutes&mdash;not longer. Three minutes from now, I will rejoin
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left the room, and went downstairs. I took out my watch. One minute
      passed. Two minutes. Why did I feel so depressed? Why did those moments
      seem so solemn and weird? Two minutes and a half....Two minutes and three
      quarters. Then I heard a pistol shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bounded up the stairs and entered the room. A cry of horror escaped me.
      In the middle of the room, the man was lying on his left side, motionless.
      Blood was flowing from a wound in his forehead. Near his hand was a
      revolver, still smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in addition to this frightful spectacle, my attention was attracted
      by another object. At two feet from the body, upon the floor, I saw a
      playing-card. It was the seven of hearts. I picked it up. The lower
      extremity of each of the seven spots was pierced with a small round hole.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A half-hour later, the commissary of police arrived, then the coroner and
      the chief of the Sûreté, Mon. Dudouis. I had been careful not to touch the
      corpse. The preliminary inquiry was very brief, and disclosed nothing.
      There were no papers in the pockets of the deceased; no name upon his
      clothes; no initial upon his linen; nothing to give any clue to his
      identity. The room was in the same perfect order as before. The furniture
      had not been disturbed. Yet this man had not come to my house solely for
      the purpose of killing himself, or because he considered my place the most
      convenient one for his suicide! There must have been a motive for his act
      of despair, and that motive was, no doubt, the result of some new fact
      ascertained by him during the three minutes he was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that fact? What had he seen? What frightful secret had been
      revealed to him? There was no answer to these questions. But, at the last
      moment, an incident occurred that appeared to us of considerable
      importance. As two policemen were raising the body to place it on a
      stretcher, the left hand thus being disturbed, a crumpled card fell from
      it. The card bore these words: &ldquo;Georges Andermatt, 37 Rue de Berry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did that mean? Georges Andermatt was a rich banker in Paris, the
      founder and president of the Metal Exchange which had given such an
      impulse to the metallic industries in France. He lived in princely style;
      was the possessor of numerous automobiles, coaches, and an expensive
      racing-stable. His social affairs were very select, and Madame Andermatt
      was noted for her grace and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can that be the man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; I asked. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief of the Sûreté leaned over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not he. Mon. Andermatt is a thin man, and slightly grey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why this card?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a telephone, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in the vestibule. Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked in the directory, and then asked for number 415.21.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mon. Andermatt at home?....Please tell him that Mon. Dudouis wished
      him to come at once to 102 Boulevard Maillot. Very important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later, Mon. Andermatt arrived in his automobile. After the
      circumstances had been explained to him, he was taken in to see the
      corpse. He displayed considerable emotion, and spoke, in a low tone, and
      apparently unwillingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Etienne Varin,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... or, at least, yes.... by sight only. His brother....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he has a brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Alfred Varin. He came to see me once on some matter of business....I
      forget what it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two brothers live together&mdash;rue de Provence, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any reason why he should commit suicide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He held a card in his hand. It was your card with your address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand that. It must have been there by some chance that
      will be disclosed by the investigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very strange chance, I thought; and I felt that the others entertained
      the same impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I discovered the same impression in the papers next day, and amongst all
      my friends with whom I discussed the affair. Amid the mysteries that
      enveloped it, after the double discovery of the seven of hearts pierced
      with seven holes, after the two inscrutable events that had happened in my
      house, that visiting card promised to throw some light on the affair.
      Through it, the truth may be revealed. But, contrary to our expectations,
      Mon. Andermatt furnished no explanation. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you all I know. What more can I do? I am greatly surprised
      that my card should be found in such a place, and I sincerely hope the
      point will be cleared up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not. The official investigation established that the Varin brothers
      were of Swiss origin, had led a shifting life under various names,
      frequenting gambling resorts, associating with a band of foreigners who
      had been dispersed by the police after a series of robberies in which
      their participation was established only by their flight. At number 24 rue
      de Provence, where the Varin brothers had lived six years before, no one
      knew what had become of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess that, for my part, the case seemed to me so complicated and so
      mysterious that I did not think the problem would ever be solved, so I
      concluded to waste no more time upon it. But Jean Daspry, whom I
      frequently met at that period, became more and more interested in it each
      day. It was he who pointed out to me that item from a foreign newspaper
      which was reproduced and commented upon by the entire press. It was as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first trial of a new model of submarine boat, which is expected to
      revolutionize naval warfare, will be given in presence of the former
      Emperor at a place that will be kept secret until the last minute. An
      indiscretion has revealed its name; it is called &lsquo;The Seven-of-Hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Seven-of-Hearts! That presented a new problem. Could a connection be
      established between the name of the sub-marine and the incidents which we
      have related? But a connection of what nature? What had happened here
      could have no possible relation with the sub-marine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; said Daspry to me. &ldquo;The most diverse effects
      often proceed from the same cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, the following foreign news item was received and
      published:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is said that the plans of the new sub-marine &lsquo;Seven-of-Hearts&rsquo; were
      prepared by French engineers, who, having sought, in vain, the support of
      their compatriots, subsequently entered into negotiations with the British
      Admiralty, without success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not wish to give undue publicity to certain delicate matters which
      once provoked considerable excitement. Yet, since all danger of injury
      therefrom has now come to an end, I must speak of the article that
      appeared in the &lsquo;Echo de France,&rsquo; which aroused so much comment at that
      time, and which threw considerable light upon the mystery of the
      Seven-of-Hearts. This is the article as it was published over the
      signature of Salvator:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;THE AFFAIR OF THE SEVEN-OF-HEARTS.

  &ldquo;A CORNER OF THE VEIL RAISED.

 &ldquo;We will be brief.  Ten years ago, a young mining engineer, Louis
  Lacombe, wishing to devote his time and fortune to certain studies,
  resigned his position he then held, and rented number 102 boulevard
  Maillot, a small house that had been recently built and decorated
  for an Italian count.  Through the agency of the Varin brothers of
  Lausanne, one of whom assisted in the preliminary experiments and
  the other acted as financial agent, the young engineer was
  introduced to Georges Andermatt, the founder of the Metal Exchange.

  &ldquo;After several interviews, he succeeded in interesting the banker
  in a sub-marine boat on which he was working, and it was agreed
  that as soon as the invention was perfected, Mon. Andermatt would
  use his influence with the Minister of Marine to obtain a series of
  trials under the direction of the government.  For two years, Louis
  Lacombe was a frequent visitor at Andermatt&rsquo;s house, and he
  submitted to the banker the various improvements he made upon his
  original plans, until one day, being satisfied with the perfection
  of his work, he asked Mon. Andermatt to communicate with the
  Minister of Marine.  That day, Louis Lacombe dined at Mon.
  Andermatt&rsquo;s house.  He left there about half-past eleven at night.
  He has not been seen since.

  &ldquo;A perusal of the newspapers of that date will show that the
  young man&rsquo;s family caused every possible inquiry to be made, but
  without success; and it was the general opinion that Louis Lacombe&mdash;
  who was known as an original and visionary youth&mdash;had quietly left
  for parts unknown.

  &ldquo;Let us accept that theory&mdash;improbable, though it be,&mdash;and let us
  consider another question, which is a most important one for our
  country:  What has become of the plans of the sub-marine? Did Louis
  Lacombe carry them away?  Are they destroyed?

  &ldquo;After making a thorough investigation, we are able to assert,
  positively, that the plans are in existence, and are now in the
  possession of the two brothers Varin.  How did they acquire such a
  possession?  That is a question not yet determined; nor do we know
  why they have not tried to sell them at an earlier date.  Did they
  fear that their title to them would be called in question?  If so,
  they have lost that fear, and we can announce definitely, that the
  plans of Louis Lacombe are now the property of foreign power, and
  we are in a position to publish the correspondence that passed
  between the Varin brothers and the representative of that power.
  The &lsquo;Seven-of-Hearts&rsquo; invented by Louis Lacombe has been actually
  constructed by our neighbor.

  &ldquo;Will the invention fulfill the optimistic expectations of those
  who were concerned in that treacherous act?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And a post-script adds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Later.&mdash;Our special correspondent informs us that the preliminary
  trial of the &lsquo;Seven-of-Hearts&rsquo; has not been satisfactory.  It is
  quite likely that the plans sold and delivered by the Varin
  brothers did not include the final document carried by Louis
  Lacombe to Mon. Andermatt on the day of his disappearance, a
  document that was indispensable to a thorough understanding of the
  invention.  It contained a summary of the final conclusions of the
  inventor, and estimates and figures not contained in the other
  papers.  Without this document, the plans are incomplete; on the
  other hand, without the plans, the document is worthless.

  &ldquo;Now is the time to act and recover what belongs to us.  It may
  be a difficult matter, but we rely upon the assistance of Mon.
  Andermatt.  It will be to his interest to explain his conduct which
  has hitherto been so strange and inscrutable.  He will explain not
  only why he concealed these facts at the time of the suicide of
  Etienne Varin, but also why he has never revealed the disappearance
  of the paper&mdash;a fact well known to him.  He will tell why, during
  the last six years, he paid spies to watch the movements of the
  Varin brothers.  We expect from him, not only words, but acts.  And
  at once.  Otherwise&mdash;-&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The threat was plainly expressed. But of what did it consist? What whip
      was Salvator, the anonymous writer of the article, holding over the head
      of Mon. Andermatt?
    </p>
    <p>
      An army of reporters attacked the banker, and ten interviewers announced
      the scornful manner in which they were treated. Thereupon, the &lsquo;Echo de
      France&rsquo; announced its position in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether Mon. Andermatt is willing or not, he will be, henceforth, our
      collaborator in the work we have undertaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Daspry and I were dining together on the day on which that announcement
      appeared. That evening, with the newspapers spread over my table, we
      discussed the affair and examined it from every point of view with that
      exasperation that a person feels when walking in the dark and finding
      himself constantly falling over the same obstacles. Suddenly, without any
      warning whatsoever, the door opened and a lady entered. Her face was
      hidden behind a thick veil. I rose at once and approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, monsieur, who lives here?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame, but I do not understand&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gate was not locked,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the vestibule door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, and it occurred to me that she had used the servants&rsquo;
      entrance. How did she know the way? Then there was a silence that was
      quite embarrassing. She looked at Daspry, and I was obliged to introduce
      him. I asked her to be seated and explain the object of her visit. She
      raised her veil, and I saw that she was a brunette with regular features
      and, though not handsome, she was attractive&mdash;principally, on account
      of her sad, dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Madame Andermatt,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Andermatt!&rdquo; I repeated, with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief pause, she continued with a voice and manner that were quite
      easy and natural:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to see you about that affair&mdash;you know. I thought I
      might be able to obtain some information&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu, madame, I know nothing but what has already appeared in the
      papers. But if you will point out in what way I can help you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know....I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not until then did I suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed, and that
      some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of tranquility. For a
      moment, we were silent and embarrassed. Then Daspry stepped forward, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you permit me to ask you a few questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I will answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will answer.... whatever those questions may be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know Louis Lacombe?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, through my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see him for the last time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evening he dined with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that time, was there anything to lead you to believe that you would
      never see him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But he had spoken of a trip to Russia&mdash;in a vague way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you expected to see him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He was to dine with us, two days later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you explain his disappearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot explain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mon. Andermatt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet the article published in the &lsquo;Echo de France&rsquo; indicates&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that the Varin brothers had something to do with his disappearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what do you base your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he left our house, Louis Lacombe carried a satchel containing all
      the papers relating to his invention. Two days later, my husband, in a
      conversation with one of the Varin brothers, learned that the papers were
      in their possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he did not denounce them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there was something else in the satchel&mdash;something besides
      the papers of Louis Lacombe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated; was on the point of speaking, but, finally, remained
      silent. Daspry continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over their
      movements instead of informing the police. He hoped to recover the papers
      and, at the same time, that compromising article which has enabled the two
      brothers to hold over him threats of exposure and blackmail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over him, and over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! over you, also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over me, in particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered the last words in a hollow voice. Daspry observed it; he paced
      to and fro for a moment, then, turning to her, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you written to Louis Lacombe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. My husband had business with him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apart from those business letters, had you written to Louis Lacombe....
      other letters? Excuse my insistence, but it is absolutely necessary that I
      should know the truth. Did you write other letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those letters came into the possession of the Varin brothers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mon. Andermatt know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not seen them, but Alfred Varin has told him of their existence
      and threatened to publish them if my husband should take any steps against
      him. My husband was afraid.... of a scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has tried to recover the letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so; but I do not know. You see, after that last interview with
      Alfred Varin, and after some harsh words between me and my husband in
      which he called me to account&mdash;we live as strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, as you have nothing to lose, what do you fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be indifferent to him now, but I am the woman that he has loved,
      the one he would still love&mdash;oh! I am quite sure of that,&rdquo; she
      murmured, in a fervent voice, &ldquo;he would still love me if he had not got
      hold of those cursed letters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Did he succeed?....But the two brothers still defied him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and they boasted of having a secure hiding-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe my husband discovered that hiding-place.&rdquo;

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! where was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; I cried in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I always had that suspicion. Louis Lacombe was very ingenious and
      amused himself in his leisure hours, by making safes and locks. No doubt,
      the Varin brothers were aware of that fact and utilized one of Lacombe&rsquo;s
      safes in which to conceal the letters.... and other things, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they did not live here,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you came, four months ago, the house had been vacant for some
      time. And they may have thought that your presence here would not
      interfere with them when they wanted to get the papers. But they did not
      count on my husband, who came here on the night of 22 June, forced the
      safe, took what he was seeking, and left his card to inform the two
      brothers that he feared them no more, and that their positions were now
      reversed. Two days later, after reading the article in the &lsquo;Gil Blas,&rsquo;
      Etienne Varin came here, remained alone in this room, found the safe
      empty, and.... killed himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment, Daspry said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very simple theory....Has Mon. Andermatt spoken to you since then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has his attitude toward you changed in any way? Does he appear more
      gloomy, more anxious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t noticed any change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you think he has secured the letters. Now, in my opinion, he has
      not got those letters, and it was not he who came here on the night of 22
      June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mysterious individual who is managing this affair, who holds all the
      threads in his hands, and whose invisible but far-reaching power we have
      felt from the beginning. It was he and his friends who entered this house
      on 22 June; it was he who discovered the hiding-place of the papers; it
      was he who left Mon. Andermatt&rsquo;s card; it is he who now holds the
      correspondence and the evidence of the treachery of the Varin brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; I asked, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who writes letters to the &lsquo;Echo de France&rsquo;.... Salvator! Have we
      not convincing evidence of that fact? Does he not mention in his letters
      certain details that no one could know, except the man who had thus
      discovered the secrets of the two brothers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; stammered Madame Andermatt, in great alarm, &ldquo;he has my
      letters also, and it is he who now threatens my husband. Mon Dieu! What am
      I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to him,&rdquo; declared Daspry. &ldquo;Confide in him without reserve. Tell him
      all you know and all you may hereafter learn. Your interest and his
      interest are the same. He is not working against Mon. Andermatt, but
      against Alfred Varin. Help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your husband the document that completes the plans of Louis Lacombe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell that to Salvator, and, if possible, procure the document for him.
      Write to him at once. You risk nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advice was bold, dangerous even at first sight, but Madame Andermatt
      had no choice. Besides, as Daspry had said, she ran no risk. If the
      unknown writer were an enemy, that step would not aggravate the situation.
      If he were a stranger seeking to accomplish a particular purpose, he would
      attach to those letters only a secondary importance. Whatever might
      happen, it was the only solution offered to her, and she, in her anxiety,
      was only too glad to act on it. She thanked us effusively, and promised to
      keep us informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, two days later, she sent us the following letter that she had
      received from Salvator:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have not found the letters, but I will get them. Rest easy. I am watching
      everything. S.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the letter. It was in the same handwriting as the note I found
      in my book on the night of 22 June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daspry was right. Salvator was, indeed, the originator of that affair.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We were beginning to see a little light coming out of the darkness that
      surrounded us, and an unexpected light was thrown on certain points; but
      other points yet remained obscure&mdash;for instance, the finding of the
      two seven-of-hearts. Perhaps I was unnecessarily concerned about those two
      cards whose seven punctured spots had appeared to me under such startling
      circumstances! Yet I could not refrain from asking myself: What role will
      they play in the drama? What importance do they bear? What conclusion must
      be drawn from the fact that the submarine constructed from the plans of
      Louis Lacombe bore the name of &lsquo;Seven-of-Hearts&rsquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Daspry gave little thought to the other two cards; he devoted all his
      attention to another problem which he considered more urgent; he was
      seeking the famous hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who knows,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I may find the letters that Salvator did not
      find&mdash;by inadvertence, perhaps. It is improbable that the Varin
      brothers would have removed from a spot, which they deemed inaccessible,
      the weapon which was so valuable to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he continued to search. In a short time, the large room held no more
      secrets for him, so he extended his investigations to the other rooms. He
      examined the interior and the exterior, the stones of the foundation, the
      bricks in the walls; he raised the slates of the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, he came with a pickaxe and a spade, gave me the spade, kept the
      pickaxe, pointed to the adjacent vacant lots, and said: &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed him, but I lacked his enthusiasm. He divided the vacant land
      into several sections which he examined in turn. At last, in a corner, at
      the angle formed by the walls of two neighboring proprietors, a small pile
      of earth and gravel, covered with briers and grass, attracted his
      attention. He attacked it. I was obliged to help him. For an hour, under a
      hot sun, we labored without success. I was discouraged, but Daspry urged
      me on. His ardor was as strong as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Daspry&rsquo;s pickaxe unearthed some bones&mdash;the remains of a
      skeleton to which some scraps of clothing still hung. Suddenly, I turned
      pale. I had discovered, sticking in the earth, a small piece of iron cut
      in the form of a rectangle, on which I thought I could see red spots. I
      stooped and picked it up. That little iron plate was the exact size of a
      playing-card, and the red spots, made with red lead, were arranged upon it
      in a manner similar to the seven-of-hearts, and each spot was pierced with
      a round hole similar to the perforations in the two playing cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Daspry, I have had enough of this. You can stay if it interests
      you. But I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was that simply the expression of my excited nerves? Or was it the result
      of a laborious task executed under a burning sun? I know that I trembled
      as I walked away, and that I went to bed, where I remained forty-eight
      hours, restless and feverish, haunted by skeletons that danced around me
      and threw their bleeding hearts at my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daspry was faithful to me. He came to my house every day, and remained
      three or four hours, which he spent in the large room, ferreting,
      thumping, tapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters are here, in this room,&rdquo; he said, from time to time, &ldquo;they
      are here. I will stake my life on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the third day I arose&mdash;feeble yet, but cured. A
      substantial breakfast cheered me up. But a letter that I received that
      afternoon contributed, more than anything else, to my complete recovery,
      and aroused in me a lively curiosity. This was the letter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Monsieur,

  &ldquo;The drama, the first act of which transpired on the night of 22
  June, is now drawing to a close.  Force of circumstances compel me
  to bring the two principal actors in that drama face to face, and I
  wish that meeting to take place in your house, if you will be so
  kind as to give me the use of it for this evening from nine o&rsquo;clock
  to eleven.  It will be advisable to give your servant leave of
  absence for the evening, and, perhaps, you will be so kind as to
  leave the field open to the two adversaries.  You will remember
  that when I visited your house on the night of 22 June, I took
  excellent care of your property.  I feel that I would do you an
  injustice if I should doubt, for one moment, your absolute
  discretion in this affair.  Your devoted,

                                 &ldquo;SALVATOR.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at the whimsical
      nature of his request. There was a charming display of confidence and
      candor in his language, and nothing in the world could have induced me to
      deceive him or repay his confidence with ingratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave my servant a theatre ticket, and he left the house at eight
      o&rsquo;clock. A few minutes later, Daspry arrived. I showed him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have left the garden gate unlocked, so anyone can enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;are you going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I intend to stay right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he asks you to go&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not going. I will be discreet, but I am resolved to see what
      takes place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma foi!&rdquo; exclaimed Daspry, laughing, &ldquo;you are right, and I shall stay
      with you. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to miss it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were interrupted by the sound of the door-bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here already?&rdquo; said Daspry, &ldquo;twenty minutes ahead of time! Incredible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to the door and ushered in the visitor. It was Madame Andermatt.
      She was faint and nervous, and in a stammering voice, she ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband.... is coming.... he has an appointment.... they intend to
      give him the letters....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By chance. A message came for my husband while we were at dinner. The
      servant gave it to me by mistake. My husband grabbed it quickly, but he
      was too late. I had read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It was something like this: &lsquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock this evening, be at
      Boulevard Maillot with the papers connected with the affair. In exchange,
      the letters.&rsquo; So, after dinner, I hastened here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unknown to your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; asked Daspry, turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think as you do, that Mon. Andermatt is one of the invited guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but for what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what we are going to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I led them to a large room. The three of us could hide comfortably
      behind the velvet chimney-mantle, and observe all that should happen in
      the room. We seated ourselves there, with Madame Andermatt in the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck nine. A few minutes later, the garden gate creaked upon
      its hinges. I confess that I was greatly agitated. I was about to learn
      the key to the mystery. The startling events of the last few weeks were
      about to be explained, and, under my eyes, the last battle was going to be
      fought. Daspry seized the hand of Madame Andermatt, and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word, not a movement! Whatever you may see or hear, keep quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one entered. It was Alfred Varin. I recognized him at once, owing to
      the close resemblance he bore to his brother Etienne. There was the same
      slouching gait; the same cadaverous face covered with a black beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered with the nervous air of a man who is accustomed to fear the
      presence of traps and ambushes; who scents and avoids them. He glanced
      about the room, and I had the impression that the chimney, masked with a
      velvet portière, did not please him. He took three steps in our direction,
      when something caused him to turn and walk toward the old mosaic king,
      with the flowing beard and flamboyant sword, which he examined minutely,
      mounting on a chair and following with his fingers the outlines of the
      shoulders and head and feeling certain parts of the face. Suddenly, he
      leaped from the chair and walked away from it. He had heard the sound of
      approaching footsteps. Mon. Andermatt appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! You!&rdquo; exclaimed the banker. &ldquo;Was it you who brought me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? By no means,&rdquo; protested Varin, in a rough, jerky voice that reminded
      me of his brother, &ldquo;on the contrary, it was your letter that brought me
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter signed by you, in which you offered&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never wrote to you,&rdquo; declared Mon. Andermatt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not write to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively, Varin was put on his guard, not against the banker, but
      against the unknown enemy who had drawn him into this trap. A second time,
      he looked in our direction, then walked toward the door. But Mon.
      Andermatt barred his passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where are you going, Varin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something about this affair I don&rsquo;t like. I am going home. Good
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need of that, Mon. Andermatt. I have nothing to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have something to say to you, and this is a good time to say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you will not pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varin recoiled before the resolute attitude of the banker, as he muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, be quick about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One thing astonished me; and I have no doubt my two companions experienced
      a similar feeling. Why was Salvator not there? Was he not a necessary
      party at this conference? Or was he satisfied to let these two adversaries
      fight it out between themselves? At all events, his absence was a great
      disappointment, although it did not detract from the dramatic strength of
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment, Mon. Andermatt approached Varin and, face to face, eye to
      eye, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, after all these years and when you have nothing more to fear, you
      can answer me candidly: What have you done with Louis Lacombe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question! As if I knew anything about him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do know! You and your brother were his constant companions, almost
      lived with him in this very house. You knew all about his plans and his
      work. And the last night I ever saw Louis Lacombe, when I parted with him
      at my door, I saw two men slinking away in the shadows of the trees. That,
      I am ready to swear to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what has that to do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two men were you and your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best proof is that, two days later, you yourself showed me the papers
      and the plans that belonged to Lacombe and offered to sell them. How did
      these papers come into your possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you, Mon. Andermatt, that we found them on Louis
      Lacombe&rsquo;s table, the morning after his disappearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law will prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not appeal to the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Ah! Why&mdash;-,&rdquo; stammered the banker, with a slight display of
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well, Mon. Andermatt, if you had the least certainty of our
      guilt, our little threat would not have stopped you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What threat? Those letters? Do you suppose I ever gave those letters a
      moment&rsquo;s thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did not care for the letters, why did you offer me thousands of
      francs for their return? And why did you have my brother and me tracked
      like wild beasts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To recover the plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You wanted the letters. You knew that as soon as you had the
      letters in your possession, you could denounce us. Oh! no, I couldn&rsquo;t part
      with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed heartily, but stopped suddenly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, enough of this! We are merely going over old ground. We make no
      headway. We had better let things stand as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not let them stand as they are,&rdquo; said the banker, &ldquo;and since you
      have referred to the letters, let me tell you that you will not leave this
      house until you deliver up those letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go when I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful, Mon. Andermatt. I warn you&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you shall not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see about that,&rdquo; cried Varin, in such a rage that Madame
      Andermatt could not suppress a cry of fear. Varin must have heard it, for
      he now tried to force his way out. Mon. Andermatt pushed him back. Then I
      saw him put his hand into his coat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last time, let me pass,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters, first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varin drew a revolver and, pointing it at Mon. Andermatt, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker stooped quickly. There was the sound of a pistol-shot. The
      weapon fell from Varin&rsquo;s hand. I was amazed. The shot was fired close to
      me. It was Daspry who had fired it at Varin, causing him to drop the
      revolver. In a moment, Daspry was standing between the two men, facing
      Varin; he said to him, with a sneer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were lucky, my friend, very lucky. I fired at your hand and struck
      only the revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both of them looked at him, surprised. Then he turned to the banker, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, monsieur, for meddling in your business; but, really,
      you play a very poor game. Let me hold the cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning again to Varin, Daspry said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s between us two, comrade, and play fair, if you please. Hearts are
      trumps, and I play the seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Daspry held up, before Varin&rsquo;s bewildered eyes, the little iron
      plate, marked with the seven red spots. It was a terrible shock to Varin.
      With livid features, staring eyes, and an air of intense agony, the man
      seemed to be hypnotized at the sight of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One who meddles in other people&rsquo;s business, down to the very bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you brought here tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you did, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have come. This morning, you received an
      invitation to come here at nine o&rsquo;clock, and bring with you all the papers
      held by you. You are here. Where are the papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was in Daspry&rsquo;s voice and manner a tone of authority that I did not
      understand; his manner was usually quite mild and conciliatory. Absolutely
      conquered, Varin placed his hand on one of his pockets, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you took from Louis Lacombe and afterwards sold to Major von
      Lieben?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these the copies or the originals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the originals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are crazy,&rdquo; said Daspry. &ldquo;Why, the major gave you only twenty
      thousand, and that was like money thrown into the sea, as the boat was a
      failure at the preliminary trials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t understand the plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plans are not complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why do you ask me for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want them. I offer you five thousand francs&mdash;not a sou
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand. Not a sou less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Daspry, who now turned to Mon. Andermatt, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will kindly sign a check for the amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But....I haven&rsquo;t got&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your check-book? Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Astounded, Mon. Andermatt examined the check-book that Daspry handed to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mine,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;How does that happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idle words, monsieur, if you please. You have merely to sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker took out his fountain pen, filled out the check and signed it.
      Varin held out his hand for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down your hand,&rdquo; said Daspry, &ldquo;there is something more.&rdquo; Then, to the
      banker, he said: &ldquo;You asked for some letters, did you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a package of letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they, Varin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they, Varin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. My brother had charge of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are hidden in this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, you know where they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not you who found the hiding-place? You appear to be as well
      informed.... as Salvator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters are not in the hiding-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varin looked at him, defiantly. Were not Daspry and Salvator the same
      person? Everything pointed to that conclusion. If so, Varin risked nothing
      in disclosing a hiding-place already known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; repeated Daspry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not got the seven of hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here it is,&rdquo; said Daspry, handing him the iron plate. Varin recoiled
      in terror, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; replied Daspry, as he walked toward the bearded king,
      climbed on a chair and applied the seven of hearts to the lower part of
      the sword in such a manner that the edges of the iron plate coincided
      exactly with the two edges of the sword. Then, with the assistance of an
      awl which he introduced alternately into each of the seven holes, he
      pressed upon seven of the little mosaic stones. As he pressed upon the
      seventh one, a clicking sound was heard, and the entire bust of the King
      turned upon a pivot, disclosing a large opening lined with steel. It was
      really a fire-proof safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see, Varin, the safe is empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see. Then, my brother has taken out the letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daspry stepped down from the chair, approached Varin, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, no more nonsense with me. There is another hiding-place. Where is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it money you want? How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Andermatt, are those letters worth ten thousand francs to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the banker, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varin closed the safe, took the seven of hearts and placed it again on the
      sword at the same spot. He thrust the awl into each of the seven holes.
      There was the same clicking sound, but this time, strange to relate, it
      was only a portion of the safe that revolved on the pivot, disclosing
      quite a small safe that was built within the door of the larger one. The
      packet of letters was here, tied with a tape, and sealed. Varin handed the
      packet to Daspry. The latter turned to the banker, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the check ready, Monsieur Andermatt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have also the last document that you received from Louis Lacombe&mdash;the
      one that completes the plans of the sub-marine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exchange was made. Daspry pocketed the document and the checks, and
      offered the packet of letters to Mon. Andermatt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what you wanted, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker hesitated a moment, as if he were afraid to touch those cursed
      letters that he had sought so eagerly. Then, with a nervous movement, he
      took them. Close to me, I heard a moan. I grasped Madame Andermatt&rsquo;s hand.
      It was cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, monsieur,&rdquo; said Daspry to the banker, &ldquo;that our business is
      ended. Oh! no thanks. It was only by a mere chance that I have been able
      to do you a good turn. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mon. Andermatt retired. He carried with him the letters written by his
      wife to Louis Lacombe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marvelous!&rdquo; exclaimed Daspry, delighted. &ldquo;Everything is coming our way.
      Now, we have only to close our little affair, comrade. You have the
      papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are&mdash;all of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daspry examined them carefully, and then placed them in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. You have kept your word,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two checks? The money?&rdquo; said Varin, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have a great deal of assurance, my man. How dare you ask such a
      thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask only what is due to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you ask pay for returning papers that you stole? Well, I think not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varin was beside himself. He trembled with rage; his eyes were bloodshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money.... the twenty thousand....&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! I need it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, be reasonable, and don&rsquo;t get excited. It won&rsquo;t do you any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daspry seized his arm so forcibly, that Varin uttered a cry of pain.
      Daspry continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you can go. The air will do you good. Perhaps you want me to show
      you the way. Ah! yes, we will go together to the vacant lot near here, and
      I will show you a little mound of earth and stones and under it&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is false! That is false!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, it is true. That little iron plate with the seven spots on it
      came from there. Louis Lacombe always carried it, and you buried it with
      the body&mdash;and with some other things that will prove very interesting
      to a judge and jury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varin covered his face with his hands, and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I am beaten. Say no more. But I want to ask you one question.
      I should like to know&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a little casket in the large safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it there on the night of 22 June?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did it contain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything that the Varin brothers had put in it&mdash;a very pretty
      collection of diamonds and pearls picked up here and there by the said
      brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did. Do you blame me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.... it was the disappearance of that casket that caused my
      brother to kill himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably. The disappearance of your correspondence was not a sufficient
      motive. But the disappearance of the casket....Is that all you wish to ask
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing more: your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask that with an idea of seeking revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! The tables may be turned. Today, you are on top. To-morrow&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. Your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man staggered, as though stunned by a heavy blow. Those two words had
      deprived him of all hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daspry laughed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! did you imagine that a Monsieur Durand or Dupont could manage an
      affair like this? No, it required the skill and cunning of Arsène Lupin.
      And now that you have my name, go and prepare your revenge. Arsène Lupin
      will wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he pushed the bewildered Varin through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daspry! Daspry!&rdquo; I cried, pushing aside the curtain. He ran to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Andermatt is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to her, caused her to inhale some salts, and, while caring for
      her, questioned me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters of Louis Lacombe that you gave to her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck his forehead and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she think that I could do such a thing!...But, of course she would.
      Imbecile that I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Andermatt was now revived. Daspry took from his pocket a small
      package exactly similar to the one that Mon. Andermatt had carried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your letters, Madame. These are the genuine letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But.... the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The others are the same, rewritten by me and carefully worded. Your
      husband will not find anything objectionable in them, and will never
      suspect the substitution since they were taken from the safe in his
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the handwriting&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no handwriting that cannot be imitated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him in the same words she might have used to a man in her own
      social circle, so I concluded that she had not witnessed the final scene
      between Varin and Arsène Lupin. But the surprising revelation caused me
      considerable embarrassment. Lupin! My club companion was none other than
      Arsène Lupin. I could not realize it. But he said, quite at his ease:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can say farewell to Jean Daspry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jean Daspry is going on a long journey. I shall send him to Morocco.
      There, he may find a death worthy of him. I may say that that is his
      expectation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Arsène Lupin will remain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Decidedly. Arsène Lupin is simply at the threshold of his career, and
      he expects&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was impelled by curiosity to interrupt him, and, leading him away from
      the hearing of Madame Andermatt, I asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you discover the smaller safe yourself&mdash;the one that held the
      letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, after a great deal of trouble. I found it yesterday afternoon while
      you were asleep. And yet, God knows it was simple enough! But the simplest
      things are the ones that usually escape our notice.&rdquo; Then, showing me the
      seven-of-hearts, he added: &ldquo;Of course I had guessed that, in order to open
      the larger safe, this card must be placed on the sword of the mosaic
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you guess that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite easily. Through private information, I knew that fact when I came
      here on the evening of 22 June&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you left me&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, after turning the subject of our conversation to stories of crime
      and robbery which were sure to reduce you to such a nervous condition that
      you would not leave your bed, but would allow me to complete my search
      uninterrupted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scheme worked perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I knew when I came here that there was a casket concealed in a safe
      with a secret lock, and that the seven-of-hearts was the key to that lock.
      I had merely to place the card upon the spot that was obviously intended
      for it. An hour&rsquo;s examination showed me where the spot was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observe the fellow in mosaic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old emperor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old emperor is an exact representation of the king of hearts on all
      playing cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But how does the seven of hearts open the larger safe at
      one time and the smaller safe at another time? And why did you open only
      the larger safe in the first instance? I mean on the night of 22 June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because I always placed the seven of hearts in the same way. I never
      changed the position. But, yesterday, I observed that by reversing the
      card, by turning it upside down, the arrangement of the seven spots on the
      mosaic was changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, parbleu! But a person has to think of those things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something else: you did not know the history of those letters
      until Madame Andermatt&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoke of them before me? No. Because I found in the safe, besides the
      casket, nothing but the correspondence of the two brothers which disclosed
      their treachery in regard to the plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was by chance that you were led, first, to investigate the
      history of the two brothers, and then to search for the plans and
      documents relating to the sub-marine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply by chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose did you make the search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; exclaimed Daspry, laughing, &ldquo;how deeply interested you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The subject fascinates me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, presently, after I have escorted Madame Andermatt to a
      carriage, and dispatched a short story to the &lsquo;Echo de France,&rsquo; I will
      return and tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and wrote one of those short, clear-cut articles which served
      to amuse and mystify the public. Who does not recall the sensation that
      followed that article produced throughout the entire world?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin has solved the problem recently submitted by Salvator.
      Having acquired possession of all the documents and original plans of the
      engineer Louis Lacombe, he has placed them in the hands of the Minister of
      Marine, and he has headed a subscription list for the purpose of
      presenting to the nation the first submarine constructed from those plans.
      His subscription is twenty thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand francs! The checks of Mon. Andermatt?&rdquo; I exclaimed, when
      he had given me the paper to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. It was quite right that Varin should redeem his treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      And that is how I made the acquaintance of Arsène Lupin. That is how I
      learned that Jean Daspry, a member of my club, was none other than Arsène
      Lupin, gentleman-thief. That is how I formed very agreeable ties of
      friendship with that famous man, and, thanks to the confidence with which
      he honored me, how I became his very humble and faithful historiographer.

    <h2>
      VII. Madame Imbert&rsquo;s Safe
    </h2>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, there were still half a dozen carriages
      in front of one of those small houses which form only the side of the
      boulevard Berthier. The door of that house opened, and a number of guests,
      male and female, emerged. The majority of them entered their carriages and
      were quickly driven away, leaving behind only two men who walked down
      Courcelles, where they parted, as one of them lived in that street. The
      other decided to return on foot as far as the Porte-Maillot. It was a
      beautiful winter&rsquo;s night, clear and cold; a night on which a brisk walk is
      agreeable and refreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at the end of a few minutes, he had the disagreeable impression that
      he was being followed. Turning around, he saw a man skulking amongst the
      trees. He was not a coward; yet he felt it advisable to increase his
      speed. Then his pursuer commenced to run; and he deemed it prudent to draw
      his revolver and face him. But he had no time. The man rushed at him and
      attacked him violently. Immediately, they were engaged in a desperate
      struggle, wherein he felt that his unknown assailant had the advantage. He
      called for help, struggled, and was thrown down on a pile of gravel,
      seized by the throat, and gagged with a handkerchief that his assailant
      forced into his mouth. His eyes closed, and the man who was smothering him
      with his weight arose to defend himself against an unexpected attack. A
      blow from a cane and a kick from a boot; the man uttered two cries of
      pain, and fled, limping and cursing. Without deigning to pursue the
      fugitive, the new arrival stooped over the prostrate man and inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not injured, but he was dazed and unable to stand. His rescuer
      procured a carriage, placed him in it, and accompanied him to his house on
      the avenue de la Grande-Armée. On his arrival there, quite recovered, he
      overwhelmed his saviour with thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe you my life, monsieur, and I shall not forget it. I do not wish to
      alarm my wife at this time of night, but, to-morrow, she will be pleased
      to thank you personally. Come and breakfast with us. My name is Ludovic
      Imbert. May I ask yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he handed Mon. Imbert a card bearing the name: &ldquo;Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At that time, Arsène Lupin did not enjoy the celebrity which the Cahorn
      affair, his escape from the Prison de la Santé, and other brilliant
      exploits, afterwards gained for him. He had not even used the name of
      Arsène Lupin. The name was specially invented to designate the rescuer of
      Mon. Imbert; that is to say, it was in that affair that Arsène Lupin was
      baptized. Fully armed and ready for the fray, it is true, but lacking the
      resources and authority which command success, Arsène Lupin was then
      merely an apprentice in a profession wherein he soon became a master.
    </p>
    <p>
      With what a thrill of joy he recalled the invitation he received that
      night! At last, he had reached his goal! At last, he had undertaken a task
      worthy of his strength and skill! The Imbert millions! What a magnificent
      feast for an appetite like his!
    </p>
    <p>
      He prepared a special toilet for the occasion; a shabby frock-coat, baggy
      trousers, a frayed silk hat, well-worn collar and cuffs, all quite correct
      in form, but bearing the unmistakable stamp of poverty. His cravat was a
      black ribbon pinned with a false diamond. Thus accoutred, he descended the
      stairs of the house in which he lived at Montmartre. At the third floor,
      without stopping, he rapped on a closed door with the head of his cane. He
      walked to the exterior boulevards. A tram-car was passing. He boarded it,
      and some one who had been following him took a seat beside him. It was the
      lodger who occupied the room on the third floor. A moment later, this man
      said to Lupin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is all fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going there to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You breakfast&mdash;there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Why not? I rescued Mon. Ludovic Imbert from certain death at
      your hands. Mon. Imbert is not devoid of gratitude. He invited me to
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence. Then the other said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not going to throw up the scheme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Lupin, &ldquo;When I arranged that little case of assault
      and battery, when I took the trouble at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, to
      rap you with my cane and tap you with my boot at the risk of injuring my
      only friend, it was not my intention to forego the advantages to be gained
      from a rescue so well arranged and executed. Oh! no, not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the strange rumors we hear about their fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that. For six months, I have worked on this affair,
      investigated it, studied it, questioned the servants, the money-lenders
      and men of straw; for six months, I have shadowed the husband and wife.
      Consequently, I know what I am talking about. Whether the fortune came to
      them from old Brawford, as they pretend, or from some other source, I do
      not care. I know that it is a reality; that it exists. And some day it
      will be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigre! One hundred millions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us say ten, or even five&mdash;that is enough! They have a safe full
      of bonds, and there will be the devil to pay if I can&rsquo;t get my hands on
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tram-car stopped at the Place de l&rsquo;Etoile. The man whispered to Lupin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, at present. You will hear from me. There is no hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, Arsène Lupin was ascending the magnificent flight of
      stairs in the Imbert mansion, and Mon. Imbert introduced him to his wife.
      Madame Gervaise Imbert was a short plump woman, and very talkative. She
      gave Lupin a cordial welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desired that we should be alone to entertain our saviour,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the outset, they treated &ldquo;our saviour&rdquo; as an old and valued friend.
      By the time dessert was served, their friendship was well cemented, and
      private confidences were being exchanged. Arsène related the story of his
      life, the life of his father as a magistrate, the sorrows of his
      childhood, and his present difficulties. Gervaise, in turn, spoke of her
      youth, her marriage, the kindness of the aged Brawford, the hundred
      millions that she had inherited, the obstacles that prevented her from
      obtaining the enjoyment of her inheritance, the moneys she had been
      obliged to borrow at an exorbitant rate of interest, her endless
      contentions with Brawford&rsquo;s nephews, and the litigation! the injunctions!
      in fact, everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of it, Monsieur Lupin, the bonds are there, in my husband&rsquo;s
      office, and if we detach a single coupon, we lose everything! They are
      there, in our safe, and we dare not touch them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Lupin shivered at the bare idea of his proximity to so much
      wealth. Yet he felt quite certain that Monsieur Lupin would never suffer
      from the same difficulty as his fair hostess who declared she dare not
      touch the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! they are there!&rdquo; he repeated, to himself; &ldquo;they are there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A friendship formed under such circumstances soon led to closer relations.
      When discreetly questioned, Arsène Lupin confessed his poverty and
      distress. Immediately, the unfortunate young man was appointed private
      secretary to the Imberts, husband and wife, at a salary of one hundred
      francs a month. He was to come to the house every day and receive orders
      for his work, and a room on the second floor was set apart as his office.
      This room was directly over Mon. Imbert&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arsène soon realized that his position as secretary was essentially a
      sinecure. During the first two months, he had only four important letters
      to recopy, and was called only once to Mon. Imbert&rsquo;s office; consequently,
      he had only one opportunity to contemplate, officially, the Imbert safe.
      Moreover, he noticed that the secretary was not invited to the social
      functions of the employer. But he did not complain, as he preferred to
      remain, modestly, in the shade and maintain his peace and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he was not wasting any time. From the beginning, he made
      clandestine visits to Mon. Imbert&rsquo;s office, and paid his respects to the
      safe, which was hermetically closed. It was an immense block of iron and
      steel, cold and stern in appearance, which could not be forced open by the
      ordinary tools of the burglar&rsquo;s trade. But Arsène Lupin was not
      discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where force fails, cunning prevails,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;The essential
      thing is to be on the spot when the opportunity occurs. In the meantime, I
      must watch and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made immediately some preliminary preparations. After careful soundings
      made upon the floor of his room, he introduced a lead pipe which
      penetrated the ceiling of Mon. Imbert&rsquo;s office at a point between the two
      screeds of the cornice. By means of this pipe, he hoped to see and hear
      what transpired in the room below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth, he passed his days stretched at full length upon the floor. He
      frequently saw the Imberts holding a consultation in front of the safe,
      investigating books and papers. When they turned the combination lock, he
      tried to learn the figures and the number of turns they made to the right
      and left. He watched their movements; he sought to catch their words.
      There was also a key necessary to complete the opening of the safe. What
      did they do with it? Did they hide it?
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, he saw them leave the room without locking the safe. He descended
      the stairs quickly, and boldly entered the room. But they had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I made a mistake in the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Monsieur Lupin, come in,&rdquo; cried Madame Imbert, &ldquo;are you not at
      home here? We want your advice. What bonds should we sell? The foreign
      securities or the government annuities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the injunction?&rdquo; said Lupin, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it doesn&rsquo;t cover all the bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door of the safe and withdrew a package of bonds. But her
      husband protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Gervaise, it would be foolish to sell the foreign bonds. They are
      going up, whilst the annuities are as high as they ever will be. What do
      you think, my dear friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dear friend had no opinion; yet he advised the sacrifice of the
      annuities. Then she withdrew another package and, from it, she took a
      paper at random. It proved to be a three-per-cent annuity worth two
      thousand francs. Ludovic placed the package of bonds in his pocket. That
      afternoon, accompanied by his secretary, he sold the annuities to a
      stock-broker and realized forty-six thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Madame Imbert might have said about it, Arsène Lupin did not feel
      at home in the Imbert house. On the contrary, his position there was a
      peculiar one. He learned that the servants did not even know his name.
      They called him &ldquo;monsieur.&rdquo; Ludovic always spoke of him in the same way:
      &ldquo;You will tell monsieur. Has monsieur arrived?&rdquo; Why that mysterious
      appellation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, after their first outburst of enthusiasm, the Imberts seldom
      spoke to him, and, although treating him with the consideration due to a
      benefactor, they gave him little or no attention. They appeared to regard
      him as an eccentric character who did not like to be disturbed, and they
      respected his isolation as if it were a stringent rule on his part. On one
      occasion, while passing through the vestibule, he heard Madame Imbert say
      to the two gentlemen:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is such a barbarian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I am a barbarian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, without seeking to solve the question of their strange conduct, he
      proceeded with the execution of his own plans. He had decided that he
      could not depend on chance, nor on the negligence of Madame Imbert, who
      carried the key of the safe, and who, on locking the safe, invariably
      scattered the letters forming the combination of the lock. Consequently,
      he must act for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, an incident precipitated matters; it was the vehement campaign
      instituted against the Imberts by certain newspapers that accused the
      Imberts of swindling. Arsène Lupin was present at certain family
      conferences when this new vicissitude was discussed. He decided that if he
      waited much longer, he would lose everything. During the next five days,
      instead of leaving the house about six o&rsquo;clock, according to his usual
      habit, he locked himself in his room. It was supposed that he had gone
      out. But he was lying on the floor surveying the office of Mon. Imbert.
      During those five evenings, the favorable opportunity that he awaited did
      not take place. He left the house about midnight by a side door to which
      he held the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the sixth day, he learned that the Imberts, actuated by the
      malevolent insinuations of their enemies, proposed to make an inventory of
      the contents of the safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will do it to-night,&rdquo; thought Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And truly, after dinner, Imbert and his wife retired to the office and
      commenced to examine the books of account and the securities contained in
      the safe. Thus, one hour after another passed away. He heard the servants
      go upstairs to their rooms. No one now remained on the first floor.
      Midnight! The Imberts were still at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get to work,&rdquo; murmured Lupin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his window. It opened on a court. Outside, everything was dark
      and quiet. He took from his desk a knotted rope, fastened it to the
      balcony in front of his window, and quietly descended as far as the window
      below, which was that of the of Imbert&rsquo;s office. He stood upon the balcony
      for a moment, motionless, with attentive ear and watchful eye, but the
      heavy curtains effectually concealed the interior of the room. He
      cautiously pushed on the double window. If no one had examined it, it
      ought to yield to the slightest pressure, for, during the afternoon, he
      had so fixed the bolt that it would not enter the staple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window yielded to his touch. Then, with infinite care, he pushed it
      open sufficiently to admit his head. He parted the curtains a few inches,
      looked in, and saw Mon. Imbert and his wife sitting in front of the safe,
      deeply absorbed in their work and speaking softly to each other at rare
      intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He calculated the distance between him and them, considered the exact
      movements he would require to make in order to overcome them, one after
      the other, before they could call for help, and he was about to rush upon
      them, when Madame Imbert said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stay and finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish! Why, that will take you all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. An hour, at the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She retired. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes passed. Arsène pushed the
      window a little farther open. The curtains shook. He pushed once more.
      Mon. Imbert turned, and, seeing the curtains blown by the wind, he rose to
      close the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a cry, not the trace of struggle. With a few precise
      moments, and without causing him the least injury, Arsène stunned him,
      wrapped the curtain about his head, bound him hand and foot, and did it
      all in such a manner that Mon. Imbert had no opportunity to recognize his
      assailant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly, he approached the safe, seized two packages that he placed under
      his arm, left the office, and opened the servants&rsquo; gate. A carriage was
      stationed in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that, first&mdash;and follow me,&rdquo; he said to the coachman. He
      returned to the office, and, in two trips, they emptied the safe. Then
      Arsène went to his own room, removed the rope, and all other traces of his
      clandestine work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later, Arsène Lupin and his assistant examined the stolen
      goods. Lupin was not disappointed, as he had foreseen that the wealth of
      the Imberts had been greatly exaggerated. It did not consist of hundreds
      of millions, nor even tens of millions. Yet it amounted to a very
      respectable sum, and Lupin expressed his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there will be a considerable loss when we come to
      sell the bonds, as we will have to dispose of them surreptitiously at
      reduced prices. In the meantime, they will rest quietly in my desk
      awaiting a propitious moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène saw no reason why he should not go to the Imbert house the next
      day. But a perusal of the morning papers revealed this startling fact:
      Ludovic and Gervaise Imbert had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the officers of the law seized the safe and opened it, they found
      there what Arsène Lupin had left&mdash;nothing.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Such are the facts; and I learned the sequel to them, one day, when Arsène
      Lupin was in a confidential mood. He was pacing to and fro in my room,
      with a nervous step and a feverish eye that were unusual to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;it was your most successful venture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without making a direct reply, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some impenetrable secrets connected with that affair; some
      obscure points that escape my comprehension. For instance: What caused
      their flight? Why did they not take advantage of the help I unconsciously
      gave them? It would have been so simple to say: &lsquo;The hundred millions were
      in the safe. They are no longer there, because they have been stolen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They lost their nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is it&mdash;they lost their nerve...On the other hand, it is
      true&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was the meaning of Lupin&rsquo;s reticence? It was quite obvious that he
      had not told me everything; there was something he was loath to tell. His
      conduct puzzled me. It must indeed be a very serious matter to cause such
      a man as Arsène Lupin even a momentary hesitation. I threw out a few
      questions at random.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen them since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you never experienced the slightest degree of pity for those
      unfortunate people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sudden excitement astonished me. Had I touched him on a sore spot? I
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. If you had not left them alone, they might have been able to
      face the danger, or, at least, made their escape with full pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said, indignantly. &ldquo;I suppose you have an idea that
      my soul should be filled with remorse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it remorse or regrets&mdash;anything you like&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no regrets or remorse for having stolen their fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The packages of bonds you took from their safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I stole their bonds, did I? I deprived them of a portion of their
      wealth? Is that my crime? Ah! my dear boy, you do not know the truth. You
      never imagined that those bonds were not worth the paper they were written
      on. Those bonds were false&mdash;they were counterfeit&mdash;every one of
      them&mdash;do you understand? THEY WERE COUNTERFEIT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counterfeit! The four or five millions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, counterfeit!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a fit of rage. &ldquo;Only so many scraps
      of paper! I couldn&rsquo;t raise a sou on the whole of them! And you ask me if I
      have any remorse. <i>They</i> are the ones who should have remorse and pity. They
      played me for a simpleton; and I fell into their trap. I was their latest
      victim, their most stupid gull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was affected by genuine anger&mdash;the result of malice and wounded
      pride. He continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From start to finish, I got the worst of it. Do you know the part I
      played in that affair, or rather the part they made me play? That of André
      Brawford! Yes, my boy, that is the truth, and I never suspected it. It was
      not until afterwards, on reading the newspapers, that the light finally
      dawned in my stupid brain. Whilst I was posing as his &ldquo;saviour,&rdquo; as the
      gentleman who had risked his life to rescue Mon. Imbert from the clutches
      of an assassin, they were passing me off as Brawford. Wasn&rsquo;t that
      splendid? That eccentric individual who had a room on the second floor,
      that barbarian that was exhibited only at a distance, was Brawford, and
      Brawford was I! Thanks to me, and to the confidence that I inspired under
      the name of Brawford, they were enabled to borrow money from the bankers
      and other money-lenders. Ha! what an experience for a novice! And I swear
      to you that I shall profit by the lesson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, seized my arm, and said to me, in a tone of exasperation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, at this very moment, Gervaise Imbert owes me fifteen
      hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not refrain from laughter, his rage was so grotesque. He was
      making a mountain out of a molehill. In a moment, he laughed himself, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy, fifteen hundred francs. You must know that I had not
      received one sou of my promised salary, and, more than that, she had
      borrowed from me the sum of fifteen hundred francs. All my youthful
      savings! And do you know why? To devote the money to charity! I am giving
      you a straight story. She wanted it for some poor people she was assisting&mdash;unknown
      to her husband. And my hard-earned money was wormed out of me by that
      silly pretense! Isn&rsquo;t it amusing, hein? Arsène Lupin done out of fifteen
      hundred francs by the fair lady from whom he stole four millions in
      counterfeit bonds! And what a vast amount of time and patience and cunning
      I expended to achieve that result! It was the first time in my life that I
      was played for a fool, and I frankly confess that I was fooled that time
      to the queen&rsquo;s taste!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VIII. The Black Pearl
    </h2>
    <p>
      A violent ringing of the bell awakened the concierge of number nine,
      avenue Hoche. She pulled the doorstring, grumbling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought everybody was in. It must be three o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is some one for the doctor,&rdquo; muttered her husband.
    </p>
	<p>
At that moment, a voice inquired:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Doctor Harel .... what floor?&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third floor, left. But the doctor won&rsquo;t go out at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must go to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor entered the vestibule, ascended to the first floor, the
      second, the third, and, without stopping at the doctor&rsquo;s door, he
      continued to the fifth floor. There, he tried two keys. One of them fitted
      the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! good!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;that simplifies the business wonderfully. But
      before I commence work I had better arrange for my retreat. Let me see....
      have I had sufficient time to rouse the doctor and be dismissed by him?
      Not yet.... a few minutes more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of ten minutes, he descended the stairs, grumbling noisily
      about the doctor. The concierge opened the door for him and heard it click
      behind him. But the door did not lock, as the man had quickly inserted a
      piece of iron in the lock in such a manner that the bolt could not enter.
      Then, quietly, he entered the house again, unknown to the concierge. In
      case of alarm, his retreat was assured. Noiselessly, he ascended to the
      fifth floor once more. In the antechamber, by the light of his electric
      lantern, he placed his hat and overcoat on one of the chairs, took a seat
      on another, and covered his heavy shoes with felt slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouf! Here I am&mdash;and how simple it was! I wonder why more people do
      not adopt the profitable and pleasant occupation of burglar. With a little
      care and reflection, it becomes a most delightful profession. Not too
      quiet and monotonous, of course, as it would then become wearisome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unfolded a detailed plan of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me commence by locating myself. Here, I see the vestibule in which I
      am sitting. On the street front, the drawing-room, the boudoir and
      dining-room. Useless to waste any time there, as it appears that the
      countess has a deplorable taste.... not a bibelot of any value!...Now,
      let&rsquo;s get down to business!... Ah! here is a corridor; it must lead to the
      bed chambers. At a distance of three metres, I should come to the door of
      the wardrobe-closet which connects with the chamber of the countess.&rdquo; He
      folded his plan, extinguished his lantern, and proceeded down the
      corridor, counting his distance, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One metre.... two metres.... three metres....Here is the door....Mon
      Dieu, how easy it is! Only a small, simple bolt now separates me from the
      chamber, and I know that the bolt is located exactly one metre,
      forty-three centimeters, from the floor. So that, thanks to a small
      incision I am about to make, I can soon get rid of the bolt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his pocket the necessary instruments. Then the following idea
      occurred to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, by chance, the door is not bolted. I will try it first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned the knob, and the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brave Lupin, surely fortune favors you....What&rsquo;s to be done now? You
      know the situation of the rooms; you know the place in which the countess
      hides the black pearl. Therefore, in order to secure the black pearl, you
      have simply to be more silent than silence, more invisible than darkness
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin was employed fully a half-hour in opening the second door&mdash;a
      glass door that led to the countess&rsquo; bedchamber. But he accomplished it
      with so much skill and precaution, that even had the countess been
      awake, she would not have heard the slightest sound. According to the plan
      of the rooms, that he holds, he has merely to pass around a reclining
      chair and, beyond that, a small table close to the bed. On the table,
      there was a box of letter-paper, and the black pearl was concealed in that
      box. He stooped and crept cautiously over the carpet, following the
      outlines of the reclining-chair. When he reached the extremity of it, he
      stopped in order to repress the throbbing of his heart. Although he was
      not moved by any sense of fear, he found it impossible to overcome the
      nervous anxiety that one usually feels in the midst of profound silence.
      That circumstance astonished him, because he had passed through many more
      solemn moments without the slightest trace of emotion. No danger
      threatened him. Then why did his heart throb like an alarm-bell? Was it
      that sleeping woman who affected him? Was it the proximity of another
      pulsating heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened, and thought he could discern the rhythmical breathing of a
      person asleep. It gave him confidence, like the presence of a friend. He
      sought and found the armchair; then, by slow, cautious movements, advanced
      toward the table, feeling ahead of him with outstretched arm. His right
      had touched one of the feet of the table. Ah! now, he had simply to rise,
      take the pearl, and escape. That was fortunate, as his heart was leaping
      in his breast like a wild beast, and made so much noise that he feared it
      would waken the countess. By a powerful effort of the will, he subdued the
      wild throbbing of his heart, and was about to rise from the floor when his
      left hand encountered, lying on the floor, an object which he recognized
      as a candlestick&mdash;an overturned candlestick. A moment later, his hand
      encountered another object: a clock&mdash;one of those small traveling
      clocks, covered with leather.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! What had happened? He could not understand. That candlestick, that
      clock; why were those articles not in their accustomed places? Ah! what
      had happened in the dread silence of the night?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a cry escaped him. He had touched&mdash;oh! some strange,
      unutterable thing! &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it cannot be. It is some fantasy
      of my excited brain.&rdquo; For twenty seconds, thirty seconds, he remained
      motionless, terrified, his forehead bathed with perspiration, and his
      fingers still retained the sensation of that dreadful contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a desperate effort, he ventured to extend his arm again. Once more,
      his hand encountered that strange, unutterable thing. He felt it. He must
      feel it and find out what it is. He found that it was hair, human hair,
      and a human face; and that face was cold, almost icy.
    </p>
    <p>
      However frightful the circumstances may be, a man like Arsène Lupin
      controls himself and commands the situation as soon as he learns what it
      is. So, Arsène Lupin quickly brought his lantern into use. A woman was
      lying before him, covered with blood. Her neck and shoulders were covered
      with gaping wounds. He leaned over her and made a closer examination. She
      was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! Dead!&rdquo; he repeated, with a bewildered air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh, and that
      blood&mdash;all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and congealed
      there in thick, black spots. He arose and turned on the electric lights.
      Then he beheld all the marks of a desperate struggle. The bed was in a
      state of great disorder. On the floor, the candlestick, and the clock,
      with the hands pointing to twenty minutes after eleven; then, further
      away, an overturned chair; and, everywhere, there was blood, spots of
      blood and pools of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the black pearl?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The box of letter-paper was in its place. He opened it, eagerly. The
      jewel-case was there, but it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fichtre!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You boasted of your good fortune much too soon,
      my friend Lupin. With the countess lying cold and dead, and the black
      pearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant. Get out of here as
      soon as you can, or you may get into serious trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet, he did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of here? Yes, of course. Any person would, except Arsène Lupin.
      He has something better to do. Now, to proceed in an orderly way. At all
      events, you have a clear conscience. Let us suppose that you are the
      commissary of police and that you are proceeding to make an inquiry
      concerning this affair&mdash;&mdash;Yes, but in order to do that, I
      require a clearer brain. Mine is muddled like a ragout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tumbled into an armchair, with his clenched hands pressed against his
      burning forehead.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The murder of the avenue Hoche is one of those which have recently
      surprised and puzzled the Parisian public, and, certainly, I should never
      have mentioned the affair if the veil of mystery had not been removed by
      Arsène Lupin himself. No one knew the exact truth of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who did not know&mdash;from having met her in the Bois&mdash;the fair
      Léotine Zalti, the once-famous cantatrice, wife and widow of the Count
      d&rsquo;Andillot; the Zalti, whose luxury dazzled all Paris some twenty years
      ago; the Zalti who acquired an European reputation for the magnificence of
      her diamonds and pearls? It was said that she wore upon her shoulders the
      capital of several banking houses and the gold mines of numerous
      Australian companies. Skilful jewelers worked for Zalti as they had
      formerly wrought for kings and queens. And who does not remember the
      catastrophe in which all that wealth was swallowed up? Of all that
      marvelous collection, nothing remained except the famous black pearl. The
      black pearl! That is to say a fortune, if she had wished to part with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she preferred to keep it, to live in a commonplace apartment with her
      companion, her cook, and a man-servant, rather than sell that inestimable
      jewel. There was a reason for it; a reason she was not afraid to disclose:
      the black pearl was the gift of an emperor! Almost ruined, and reduced to
      the most mediocre existence, she remained faithful to the companion of her
      happy and brilliant youth. The black pearl never left her possession. She
      wore it during the day, and, at night, concealed it in a place known to
      her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these facts, being republished in the columns of the public press,
      served to stimulate curiosity; and, strange to say, but quite obvious to
      those who have the key to the mystery, the arrest of the presumed assassin
      only complicated the question and prolonged the excitement. Two days
      later, the newspapers published the following item:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Information has reached us of the arrest of Victor Danègre, the servant
      of the Countess d&rsquo;Andillot. The evidence against him is clear and
      convincing. On the silken sleeve of his liveried waistcoat, which chief
      detective Dudouis found in his garret between the mattresses of his bed,
      several spots of blood were discovered. In addition, a cloth-covered
      button was missing from that garment, and this button was found beneath
      the bed of the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is supposed that, after dinner, in place of going to his own room,
      Danègre slipped into the wardrobe-closet, and, through the glass door, had
      seen the countess hide the precious black pearl. This is simply a theory,
      as yet unverified by any evidence. There is, also, another obscure point.
      At seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Danègre went to the tobacco-shop on the
      Boulevard de Courcelles; the concierge and the shop-keeper both affirm
      this fact. On the other hand, the countess&rsquo; companion and cook, who sleep
      at the end of the hall, both declare that, when they arose at eight
      o&rsquo;clock, the door of the antechamber and the door of the kitchen were
      locked. These two persons have been in the service of the countess for
      twenty years, and are above suspicion. The question is: How did Danègre
      leave the apartment? Did he have another key? These are matters that the
      police will investigate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the police investigation threw no light on the
      mystery. It was learned that Victor Danègre was a dangerous criminal, a
      drunkard and a debauchee. But, as they proceeded with the investigation,
      the mystery deepened and new complications arose. In the first place, a
      young woman, Mlle. De Sinclèves, the cousin and sole heiress of the
      countess, declared that the countess, a month before her death, had
      written a letter to her and in it described the manner in which the black
      pearl was concealed. The letter disappeared the day after she received it.
      Who had stolen it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the concierge related how she had opened the door for a person who
      had inquired for Doctor Harel. On being questioned, the doctor testified
      that no one had rung his bell. Then who was that person? An accomplice?
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory of an accomplice was thereupon adopted by the press and public,
      and also by Ganimard, the famous detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lupin is at the bottom of this affair,&rdquo; he said to the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; exclaimed the judge, &ldquo;you have Lupin on the brain. You see him
      everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see him everywhere, because he is everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather that you see him every time you encounter something you cannot
      explain. Besides, you overlook the fact that the crime was committed at
      twenty minutes past eleven in the evening, as is shown by the clock, while
      the nocturnal visit, mentioned by the concierge, occurred at three o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Officers of the law frequently form a hasty conviction as to the guilt of
      a suspected person, and then distort all subsequent discoveries to conform
      to their established theory. The deplorable antecedents of Victor Danègre,
      habitual criminal, drunkard and rake, influenced the judge, and despite
      the fact that nothing new was discovered in corroboration of the early
      clues, his official opinion remained firm and unshaken. He closed his
      investigation, and, a few weeks later, the trial commenced. It proved to
      be slow and tedious. The judge was listless, and the public prosecutor
      presented the case in a careless manner. Under those circumstances,
      Danègre&rsquo;s counsel had an easy task. He pointed out the defects and
      inconsistencies of the case for the prosecution, and argued that the
      evidence was quite insufficient to convict the accused. Who had made the
      key, the indispensable key without which Danègre, on leaving the
      apartment, could not have locked the door behind him? Who had ever seen
      such a key, and what had become of it? Who had seen the assassin&rsquo;s knife,
      and where is it now?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any event,&rdquo; argued the prisoner&rsquo;s counsel, &ldquo;the prosecution must
      prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the prisoner committed the
      murder. The prosecution must show that the mysterious individual who
      entered the house at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning is not the guilty party.
      To be sure, the clock indicated eleven o&rsquo;clock. But what of that? I
      contend, that proves nothing. The assassin could turn the hands of the
      clock to any hour he pleased, and thus deceive us in regard to the exact
      hour of the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor Danègre was acquitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the prison on Friday about dusk in the evening, weak and depressed
      by his six months&rsquo; imprisonment. The inquisition, the solitude, the trial,
      the deliberations of the jury, combined to fill him with a nervous fear.
      At night, he had been afflicted with terrible nightmares and haunted by
      weird visions of the scaffold. He was a mental and physical wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the assumed name of Anatole Dufour, he rented a small room on the
      heights of Montmartre, and lived by doing odd jobs wherever he could find
      them. He led a pitiful existence. Three times, he obtained regular
      employment, only to be recognized and then discharged. Sometimes, he had
      an idea that men were following him&mdash;detectives, no doubt, who were
      seeking to trap and denounce him. He could almost feel the strong hand of
      the law clutching him by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as he was eating his dinner at a neighboring restaurant, a
      man entered and took a seat at the same table. He was a person about forty
      years of age, and wore a frock-coat of doubtful cleanliness. He ordered
      soup, vegetables, and a bottle of wine. After he had finished his soup, he
      turned his eyes on Danègre, and gazed at him intently. Danègre winced. He
      was certain that this was one of the men who had been following him for
      several weeks. What did he want? Danègre tried to rise, but failed. His
      limbs refused to support him. The man poured himself a glass of wine, and
      then filled Danègre&rsquo;s glass. The man raised his glass, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your health, Victor Danègre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor started in alarm, and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!....I!.... no, no....I swear to you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will swear what? That you are not yourself? The servant of the
      countess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What servant? My name is Dufour. Ask the proprietor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Anatole Dufour to the proprietor of this restaurant, but Victor
      Danègre to the officers of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true! Some one has lied to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer took a card from his pocket and handed it to Victor, who
      read on it: &ldquo;Grimaudan, ex-inspector of the detective force. Private
      business transacted.&rdquo; Victor shuddered as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are connected with the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not now, but I have a liking for the business and I continue to work
      at it in a manner more&mdash;profitable. From time to time I strike upon a
      golden opportunity&mdash;such as your case presents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yours. I assure you it is a most promising affair, provided you are
      inclined to be reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I am not reasonable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my good fellow, you are not in a position to refuse me anything I may
      ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it.... you want?&rdquo; stammered Victor, fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will inform you in a few words. I am sent by Mademoiselle de
      Sinclèves, the heiress of the Countess d&rsquo;Andillot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To recover the black pearl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black pearl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you stole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had, then I would be the assassin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the assassin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danègre showed a forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately for me, monsieur, the Assizecourt was not of your opinion.
      The jury returned an unanimous verdict of acquittal. And when a man has a
      clear conscience and twelve good men in his favor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ex-inspector seized him by the arm and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fine phrases, my boy. Now, listen to me and weigh my words carefully.
      You will find they are worthy of your consideration. Now, Danègre, three
      weeks before the murder, you abstracted the cook&rsquo;s key to the servants&rsquo;
      door, and had a duplicate key made by a locksmith named Outard, 244 rue
      Oberkampf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; growled Victor. &ldquo;No person has seen that
      key. There is no such key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a silence, Grimaudan continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You killed the countess with a knife purchased by you at the Bazar de la
      Republique on the same day as you ordered the duplicate key. It has a
      triangular blade with a groove running from end to end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all nonsense. You are simply guessing at something you don&rsquo;t
      know. No one ever saw the knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor Danègre recoiled. The ex-inspector continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some spots of rust upon it. Shall I tell you how they came
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!.... you have a key and a knife. Who can prove that they belong to
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The locksmith, and the clerk from whom you bought the knife. I have
      already refreshed their memories, and, when you confront them, they cannot
      fail to recognize you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His speech was dry and hard, with a tone of firmness and precision.
      Danègre was trembling with fear, and yet he struggled desperately to
      maintain an air of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all the evidence you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, not at all. I have plenty more. For instance, after the crime,
      you went out the same way you had entered. But, in the centre of the
      wardrobe-room, being seized by some sudden fear, you leaned against the
      wall for support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that? No one could know such a thing,&rdquo; argued the
      desperate man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police know nothing about it, of course. They never think of lighting
      a candle and examining the walls. But if they had done so, they would have
      found on the white plaster a faint red spot, quite distinct, however, to
      trace in it the imprint of your thumb which you had pressed against the
      wall while it was wet with blood. Now, as you are well aware, under the
      Bertillon system, thumb-marks are one of the principal means of
      identification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor Danègre was livid; great drops of perspiration rolled down his face
      and fell upon the table. He gazed, with a wild look, at the strange man
      who had narrated the story of his crime as faithfully as if he had been an
      invisible witness to it. Overcome and powerless, Victor bowed his head. He
      felt that it was useless to struggle against this marvelous man. So he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will you give me, if I give you the pearl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are joking! Or do you mean that I should give you an article
      worth thousands and hundreds of thousands and get nothing in return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get your life. Is that nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate man shuddered. Then Grimaudan added, in a milder tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Danègre, that pearl has no value in your hands. It is quite
      impossible for you to sell it; so what is the use of your keeping it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are pawnbrokers.... and, some day, I will be able to get something
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that day may be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because by that time you may be in the hands of the police, and, with the
      evidence that I can furnish&mdash;the knife, the key, the thumb-mark&mdash;what
      will become of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor rested his head on his hands and reflected. He felt that he was
      lost, irremediably lost, and, at the same time, a sense of weariness and
      depression overcame him. He murmured, faintly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When must I give it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night&mdash;-within an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you refuse, I shall post this letter to the Procureur of the Republic;
      in which letter Mademoiselle de Sinclèves denounces you as the assassin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danègre poured out two glasses of wine which he drank in rapid succession,
      then, rising, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay the bill, and let us go. I have had enough of the cursed affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Night had fallen. The two men walked down the rue Lepic and followed the
      exterior boulevards in the direction of the Place de l&rsquo;Etoile. They
      pursued their way in silence; Victor had a stooping carriage and a
      dejected face. When they reached the Parc Monceau, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are near the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! You only left the house once, before your arrest, and that was
      to go to the tobacco-shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Danègre, in a dull voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed along the garden wall of the countess&rsquo; house, and crossed a
      street on a corner of which stood the tobacco-shop. A few steps further
      on, Danègre stopped; his limbs shook beneath him, and he sank to a bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what now?&rdquo; demanded his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Come, now, no nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;in front of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between two paving-stones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which stones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; I see!&rdquo; exclaimed Grimaudan, &ldquo;you want me to pay for the
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... but....I am afraid I will starve to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! that is why you hesitate. Well, I&rsquo;ll not be hard on you. How much do
      you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to buy a steerage pass to America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a hundred francs to keep me until I get work there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have two hundred. Now, speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count the paving-stones to the right from the sewer-hole. The pearl is
      between the twelfth and thirteenth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the gutter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, close to the sidewalk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimaudan glanced around to see if anyone were looking. Some tram-cars and
      pedestrians were passing. But, bah, they will not suspect anything. He
      opened his pocketknife and thrust it between the twelfth and thirteenth
      stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it is not there?&rdquo; he said to Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be there, unless someone saw me stoop down and hide it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could it be possible that the back pearl had been cast into the mud and
      filth of the gutter to be picked up by the first comer? The black pearl&mdash;a
      fortune!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far down?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About ten centimetres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dug up the wet earth. The point of his knife struck something. He
      enlarged the hole with his finger. Then he abstracted the black pearl from
      its filthy hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Here are your two hundred francs. I will send you the ticket for
      America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, this article was published in the &lsquo;Echo de France,&rsquo;
      and was copied by the leading newspapers throughout the world:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Yesterday, the famous black pearl came into the possession of
  Arsène Lupin, who recovered it from the murderer of the Countess
  d&rsquo;Andillot.  In a short time, fac-similes of that precious jewel
  will be exhibited in London, St. Petersburg, Calcutta, Buenos Ayres
  and New York.

  &ldquo;Arsène Lupin will be pleased to consider all propositions
  submitted to him through his agents.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded,&rdquo; said
      Arsène Lupin, after he had told me the foregoing history of the black
      pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is how you, under the assumed name of Grimaudan, ex-inspector of
      detectives, were chosen by fate to deprive the criminal of the benefit of
      his crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. And I confess that the affair gives me infinite satisfaction and
      pride. The forty minutes that I passed in the apartment of the Countess
      d&rsquo;Andillot, after learning of her death, were the most thrilling and
      absorbing moments of my life. In those forty minutes, involved as I was in
      a most dangerous plight, I calmly studied the scene of the murder and
      reached the conclusion that the crime must have been committed by one of
      the house servants. I also decided that, in order to get the pearl, that
      servant must be arrested, and so I left the wainscoat button; it was
      necessary, also, for me to hold some convincing evidence of his guilt, so
      I carried away the knife which I found upon the floor, and the key which I
      found in the lock. I closed and locked the door, and erased the
      finger-marks from the plaster in the wardrobe-closet. In my opinion, that
      was one of those flashes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of genius,&rdquo; I said, interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of genius, if you wish. But, I flatter myself, it would not have occurred
      to the average mortal. To frame, instantly, the two elements of the
      problem&mdash;an arrest and an acquittal; to make use of the formidable
      machinery of the law to crush and humble my victim, and reduce him to a
      condition in which, when free, he would be certain to fall into the trap I
      was laying for him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor devil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor devil, do you say? Victor Danègre, the assassin! He might have
      descended to the lowest depths of vice and crime, if he had retained the
      black pearl. Now, he lives! Think of that: Victor Danègre is alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have the black pearl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took it out of one of the secret pockets of his wallet, examined it,
      gazed at it tenderly, and caressed it with loving fingers, and sighed, as
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cold Russian prince, what vain and foolish rajah may some day
      possess this priceless treasure! Or, perhaps, some American millionaire is
      destined to become the owner of this morsel of exquisite beauty that once
      adorned the fair bosom of Leontine Zalti, the Countess d&rsquo;Andillot.&rdquo;

      IX. Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really remarkable, Velmont, what a close resemblance you bear to
      Arsène Lupin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! like everyone else, from photographs, no two of which are alike, but
      each of them leaves the impression of a face.... something like yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace Velmont displayed some vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, my dear Devanne. And, believe me, you are not the first one who
      has noticed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so striking,&rdquo; persisted Devanne, &ldquo;that if you had not been
      recommended to me by my cousin d&rsquo;Estevan, and if you were not the
      celebrated artist whose beautiful marine views I so admire, I have no
      doubt I should have warned the police of your presence in Dieppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sally was greeted with an outburst of laughter. The large dining-hall
      of the Château de Thibermesnil contained on this occasion, besides
      Velmont, the following guests: Father Gélis, the parish priest, and a
      dozen officers whose regiments were quartered in the vicinity and who had
      accepted the invitation of the banker Georges Devanne and his mother. One
      of the officers then remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that an exact description of Arsène Lupin has been furnished
      to all the police along this coast since his daring exploit on the
      Paris-Havre express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Devanne. &ldquo;That was three months ago; and a week
      later, I made the acquaintance of our friend Velmont at the casino, and,
      since then, he has honored me with several visits&mdash;an agreeable
      preamble to a more serious visit that he will pay me one of these days&mdash;or,
      rather, one of these nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech evoked another round of laughter, and the guests then passed
      into the ancient &ldquo;Hall of the Guards,&rdquo; a vast room with a high ceiling,
      which occupied the entire lower part of the Tour Guillaume&mdash;William&rsquo;s
      Tower&mdash;and wherein Georges Devanne had collected the incomparable
      treasures which the lords of Thibermesnil had accumulated through many
      centuries. It contained ancient chests, credences, andirons and
      chandeliers. The stone walls were overhung with magnificent tapestries.
      The deep embrasures of the four windows were furnished with benches, and
      the Gothic windows were composed of small panes of colored glass set in a
      leaden frame. Between the door and the window to the left stood an immense
      bookcase of Renaissance style, on the pediment of which, in letters of
      gold, was the word &ldquo;Thibermesnil,&rdquo; and, below it, the proud family
      device: &ldquo;Fais ce que veulx&rdquo; (Do what thou wishest). When the guests had
      lighted their cigars, Devanne resumed the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remember, Velmont, you have no time to lose; in fact, to-night is the
      last chance you will have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked the painter, who appeared to regard the affair as a joke.
      Devanne was about to reply, when his mother mentioned to him to keep
      silent, but the excitement of the occasion and a desire to interest his
      guests urged him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I can tell it now. It won&rsquo;t do any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests drew closer, and he commenced to speak with the satisfied air
      of a man who has an important announcement to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock, Sherlock Holmes, the famous English
      detective, for whom such a thing as mystery does not exist; Sherlock
      Holmes, the most remarkable solver of enigmas the world has ever known,
      that marvelous man who would seem to be the creation of a romantic
      novelist&mdash;Sherlock Holmes will be my guest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, Devanne was the target of numerous eager questions. &ldquo;Is
      Sherlock Holmes really coming?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it so serious as that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is Arsène
      Lupin really in this neighborhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arsène Lupin and his band are not far away. Besides the robbery of the
      Baron Cahorn, he is credited with the thefts at Montigny, Gruchet and
      Crasville. And now it is my turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he sent you a warning, as he did to Baron Cahorn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Devanne, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t work the same trick twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and pointing to a small empty space between the two enormous
      folios on one of the shelves of the bookcase, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There used to be a book there&mdash;a book of the sixteenth century
      entitled &lsquo;Chronique de Thibermesnil,&rsquo; which contained the history of the
      castle since its construction by Duke Rollo on the site of a former feudal
      fortress. There were three engraved plates in the book; one of which was a
      general view of the whole estate; another, the plan of the buildings; and
      the third&mdash;I call your attention to it, particularly&mdash;the third
      was the sketch of a subterranean passage, an entrance to which is outside
      the first line of ramparts, while the other end of the passage is here, in
      this very room. Well, that book disappeared a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; said Velmont, &ldquo;that looks bad. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a
      sufficient reason for sending for Sherlock Holmes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, that was not sufficient in itself, but another incident
      happened that gives the disappearance of the book a special significance.
      There was another copy of this book in the National Library at Paris, and
      the two books differed in certain details relating to the subterranean
      passage; for instance, each of them contained drawings and annotations,
      not printed, but written in ink and more or less effaced. I knew those
      facts, and I knew that the exact location of the passage could be
      determined only by a comparison of the two books. Now, the day after my
      book disappeared, the book was called for in the National Library by a
      reader who carried it away, and no one knows how the theft was effected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests uttered many exclamations of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, the affair looks serious,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the police investigated the matter, and, as usual, discovered no
      clue whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never do, when Arsène Lupin is concerned in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; and so I decided to ask the assistance of Sherlock Holmes, who
      replied that he was ready and anxious to enter the lists with Arsène
      Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What glory for Arsène Lupin!&rdquo; said Velmont. &ldquo;But if our national thief,
      as they call him, has no evil designs on your castle, Sherlock Holmes will
      have his trip in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are other things that will interest him, such as the discovery of
      the subterranean passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you told us that one end of the passage was outside the ramparts and
      the other was in this very room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but in what part of the room? The line which represents the passage
      on the charts ends here, with a small circle marked with the letters
      &lsquo;T.G.,&rsquo; which no doubt stand for &lsquo;Tour Guillaume.&rsquo; But the tower is round,
      and who can tell the exact spot at which the passage touches the tower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Devanne lighted a second cigar and poured himself a glass of Benedictine.
      His guests pressed him with questions and he was pleased to observe the
      interest that his remarks had created. Then he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The secret is lost. No one knows it. The legend is to the effect that the
      former lords of the castle transmitted the secret from father to son on
      their deathbeds, until Geoffroy, the last of the race, was beheaded during
      the Revolution in his nineteenth year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is over a century ago. Surely, someone has looked for it since that
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but they failed to find it. After I purchased the castle, I made a
      diligent search for it, but without success. You must remember that this
      tower is surrounded by water and connected with the castle only by a
      bridge; consequently, the passage must be underneath the old moat. The
      plan that was in the book in the National Library showed a series of
      stairs with a total of forty-eight steps, which indicates a depth of more
      than ten meters. You see, the mystery lies within the walls of this room,
      and yet I dislike to tear them down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing to show where it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon. Devanne, we should turn our attention to the two quotations,&rdquo;
       suggested Father Gélis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mon. Devanne, laughing, &ldquo;our worthy father is fond of
      reading memoirs and delving into the musty archives of the castle.
      Everything relating to Thibermesnil interests him greatly. But the
      quotations that he mentions only serve to complicate the mystery. He has
      read somewhere that two kings of France have known the key to the puzzle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two kings of France! Who were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry the Fourth and Louis the Sixteenth. And the legend runs like this:
      On the eve of the battle of Arques, Henry the Fourth spent the night in
      this castle. At eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, Louise de Tancarville, the
      prettiest woman in Normandy, was brought into the castle through the
      subterranean passage by Duke Edgard, who, at the same time, informed the
      king of the secret passage. Afterward, the king confided the secret to his
      minister Sully, who, in turn, relates the story in his book, &ldquo;Royales
      Economies d&rsquo;Etat,&rdquo; without making any comment upon it, but linking with it
      this incomprehensible sentence: &lsquo;Turn one eye on the bee that shakes, the
      other eye will lead to God!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a brief silence, Velmont laughed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, it doesn&rsquo;t throw a dazzling light upon the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but Father Gélis claims that Sully concealed the key to the mystery
      in this strange sentence in order to keep the secret from the secretaries
      to whom he dictated his memoirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an ingenious theory,&rdquo; said Velmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it may be nothing more; I cannot see that it throws any light on
      the mysterious riddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it also to receive the visit of a lady that Louis the Sixteenth
      caused the passage to be opened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mon. Devanne. &ldquo;All I can say is that the king stopped
      here one night in 1784, and that the famous Iron Casket found in the
      Louvre contained a paper bearing these words in the king&rsquo;s own writing:
      &lsquo;Thibermesnil 3-4-11.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace Velmont laughed heartily, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last! And now that we have the magic key, where is the man who can fit
      it to the invisible lock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh as much as you please, monsieur,&rdquo; said Father Gélis, &ldquo;but I am
      confident the solution is contained in those two sentences, and some day
      we will find a man able to interpret them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sherlock Holmes is the man,&rdquo; said Mon. Devanne, &ldquo;unless Arsène Lupin gets
      ahead of him. What is your opinion, Velmont?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Velmont arose, placed his hand on Devanne&rsquo;s shoulder, and declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that the information furnished by your book and the book of the
      National Library was deficient in a very important detail which you have
      now supplied. I thank you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The missing key. Now that I have it, I can go to work at once,&rdquo; said
      Velmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; without losing a minute,&rdquo; said Devanne, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even a second!&rdquo; replied Velmont. &ldquo;To-night, before the arrival of
      Sherlock Holmes, I must plunder your castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no time to lose. Oh! by the way, I can drive you over this
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Dieppe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am going to meet Monsieur and Madame d&rsquo;Androl and a young lady of
      their acquaintance who are to arrive by the midnight train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then addressing the officers, Devanne added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I shall expect to see all of you at breakfast to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was accepted. The company dispersed, and a few moments
      later Devanne and Velmont were speeding toward Dieppe in an automobile.
      Devanne dropped the artist in front of the Casino, and proceeded to the
      railway station. At twelve o&rsquo;clock his friends alighted from the train. A
      half hour later the automobile was at the entrance to the castle. At one
      o&rsquo;clock, after a light supper, they retired. The lights were extinguished,
      and the castle was enveloped in the darkness and silence of the night.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The moon appeared through a rift in the clouds, and filled the
      drawing-room with its bright white light. But only for a moment. Then the
      moon again retired behind its ethereal draperies, and darkness and silence
      reigned supreme. No sound could be heard, save the monotonous ticking of
      the clock. It struck two, and then continued its endless repetitions of
      the seconds. Then, three o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, something clicked, like the opening and closing of a signal-disc
      that warns the passing train. A thin stream of light flashed to every
      corner of the room, like an arrow that leaves behind it a trail of light.
      It shot forth from the central fluting of a column that supported the
      pediment of the bookcase. It rested for a moment on the panel opposite
      like a glittering circle of burnished silver, then flashed in all
      directions like a guilty eye that scrutinizes every shadow. It disappeared
      for a short time, but burst forth again as a whole section of the bookcase
      revolved on a pivot and disclosed a large opening like a vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man entered, carrying an electric lantern. He was followed by a second
      man, who carried a coil of rope and various tools. The leader inspected
      the room, listened a moment, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then eight men, stout fellows with resolute faces, entered the room, and
      immediately commenced to remove the furnishings. Arsène Lupin passed
      quickly from one piece of furniture to another, examined each, and,
      according to its size or artistic value, he directed his men to take it or
      leave it. If ordered to be taken, it was carried to the gaping mouth of
      the tunnel, and ruthlessly thrust into the bowels of the earth. Such was
      the fate of six armchairs, six small Louis XV chairs, a quantity of
      Aubusson tapestries, some candelabra, paintings by Fragonard and Nattier,
      a bust by Houdon, and some statuettes. Sometimes, Lupin would linger
      before a beautiful chest or a superb picture, and sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is too heavy.... too large.... what a pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In forty minutes the room was dismantled; and it had been accomplished in
      such an orderly manner and with as little noise as if the various articles
      had been packed and wadded for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lupin said to the last man who departed by way of the tunnel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not come back. You understand, that as soon as the auto-van is
      loaded, you are to proceed to the grange at Roquefort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, patron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me the motor-cycle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the man had disappeared, Arsène Lupin pushed the section of the
      bookcase back into its place, carefully effaced the traces of the men&rsquo;s
      footsteps, raised a portière, and entered a gallery, which was the only
      means of communication between the tower and the castle. In the center of
      this gallery there was a glass cabinet which had attracted Lupin&rsquo;s
      attentions. It contained a valuable collection of watches, snuff-boxes,
      rings, chatelaines and miniatures of rare and beautiful workmanship. He
      forced the lock with a small jimmy, and experienced a great pleasure in
      handling those gold and silver ornaments, those exquisite and delicate
      works of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried a large linen bag, specially prepared for the removal of such
      knick-knacks. He filled it. Then he filled the pockets of his coat,
      waistcoat and trousers. And he was just placing over his left arm a number
      of pearl reticules when he heard a slight sound. He listened. No, he was
      not deceived. The noise continued. Then he remembered that, at one end of
      the gallery, there was a stairway leading to an unoccupied apartment, but
      which was probably occupied that night by the young lady whom Mon. Devanne
      had brought from Dieppe with his other visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he extinguished his lantern, and had scarcely gained the
      friendly shelter of a window-embrasure, when the door at the top of the
      stairway was opened and a feeble light illuminated the gallery. He could
      feel&mdash;for, concealed by a curtain, he could not see&mdash;that a
      woman was cautiously descending the upper steps of the stairs. He hoped
      she would come no closer. Yet, she continued to descend, and even advanced
      some distance into the room. Then she uttered a faint cry. No doubt she
      had discovered the broken and dismantled cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She advanced again. Now he could smell the perfume, and hear the throbbing
      of her heart as she drew closer to the window where he was concealed. She
      passed so close that her skirt brushed against the window-curtain, and
      Lupin felt that she suspected the presence of another, behind her, in the
      shadow, within reach of her hand. He thought: &ldquo;She is afraid. She will go
      away.&rdquo; But she did not go. The candle, that she carried in her trembling
      hand, grew brighter. She turned, hesitated a moment, appeared to listen,
      then suddenly drew aside the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood face to face. Arsène was astounded. He murmured, involuntarily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Miss Nelly. Miss Nelly! his fellow passenger on the transatlantic
      steamer, who had been the subject of his dreams on that memorable voyage,
      who had been a witness to his arrest, and who, rather than betray him, had
      dropped into the water the Kodak in which he had concealed the bank-notes
      and diamonds. Miss Nelly! that charming creature, the memory of whose face
      had sometimes cheered, sometimes saddened the long hours of imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such an unexpected encounter that brought them face to face in that
      castle at that hour of the night, that they could not move, nor utter a
      word; they were amazed, hypnotized, each at the sudden apparition of the
      other. Trembling with emotion, Miss Nelly staggered to a seat. He remained
      standing in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, he realized the situation and conceived the impression he must
      have produced at that moment with his arms laden with knick-knacks, and
      his pockets and a linen sack overflowing with plunder. He was overcome
      with confusion, and he actually blushed to find himself in the position of
      a thief caught in the act. To her, henceforth, he was a thief, a man who
      puts his hand in another&rsquo;s pocket, who steals into houses and robs people
      while they sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A watch fell upon the floor; then another. These were followed by other
      articles which slipped from his grasp one by one. Then, actuated by a
      sudden decision, he dropped the other articles into an armchair, emptied
      his pockets and unpacked his sack. He felt very uncomfortable in Nelly&rsquo;s
      presence, and stepped toward her with the intention of speaking to her,
      but she shuddered, rose quickly and fled toward the salon. The portière
      closed behind her. He followed her. She was standing trembling and amazed
      at the sight of the devastated room. He said to her, at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, at three o&rsquo;clock, everything will be returned. The furniture
      will be brought back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, so he repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise it. To-morrow, at three o&rsquo;clock. Nothing in the world could
      induce me to break that promise....To-morrow, at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a long silence that he dared not break, whilst the agitation
      of the young girl caused him a feeling of genuine regret. Quietly, without
      a word, he turned away, thinking: &ldquo;I hope she will go away. I can&rsquo;t endure
      her presence.&rdquo; But the young girl suddenly spoke, and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen.... footsteps....I hear someone....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with astonishment. She seemed to be overwhelmed by the
      thought of approaching peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must go&mdash;you must escape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;you must. Oh! do not remain here another minute. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran, quickly, to the door leading to the gallery and listened. No,
      there was no one there. Perhaps the noise was outside. She waited a
      moment, then returned reassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Arsène Lupin had disappeared.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As soon as Mon. Devanne was informed of the pillage of his castle, he said
      to himself: It was Velmont who did it, and Velmont is Arsène Lupin. That
      theory explained everything, and there was no other plausible explanation.
      And yet the idea seemed preposterous. It was ridiculous to suppose that
      Velmont was anyone else than Velmont, the famous artist, and club-fellow
      of his cousin d&rsquo;Estevan. So, when the captain of the gendarmes arrived to
      investigate the affair, Devanne did not even think of mentioning his
      absurd theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the forenoon there was a lively commotion at the castle. The
      gendarmes, the local police, the chief of police from Dieppe, the
      villagers, all circulated to and fro in the halls, examining every nook
      and corner that was open to their inspection. The approach of the
      maneuvering troops, the rattling fire of the musketry, added to the
      picturesque character of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preliminary search furnished no clue. Neither the doors nor windows
      showed any signs of having been disturbed. Consequently, the removal of
      the goods must have been effected by means of the secret passage. Yet,
      there were no indications of footsteps on the floor, nor any unusual marks
      upon the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their investigations revealed, however, one curious fact that denoted the
      whimsical character of Arsène Lupin: the famous Chronique of the sixteenth
      century had been restored to its accustomed place in the library and,
      beside it, there was a similar book, which was none other than the volume
      stolen from the National Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock the military officers arrived. Devanne welcomed them
      with his usual gayety; for, no matter how much chagrin he might suffer
      from the loss of his artistic treasures, his great wealth enabled him to
      bear his loss philosophically. His guests, Monsieur and Madame d&rsquo;Androl
      and Miss Nelly, were introduced; and it was then noticed that one of the
      expected guests had not arrived. It was Horace Velmont. Would he come? His
      absence had awakened the suspicions of Mon. Devanne. But at twelve o&rsquo;clock
      he arrived. Devanne exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! here you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, am I not punctual?&rdquo; asked Velmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I am surprised that you are.... after such a busy night! I
      suppose you know the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have robbed the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Velmont, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly as I predicted. But, first escort Miss Underdown to the
      dining-room. Mademoiselle, allow me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, as he remarked the extreme agitation of the young girl. Then,
      recalling the incident, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! of course, you met Arsène Lupin on the steamer, before his arrest,
      and you are astonished at the resemblance. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply. Velmont stood before her, smiling. He bowed. She took
      his proffered arm. He escorted her to her place, and took his seat
      opposite her. During the breakfast, the conversation related exclusively
      to Arsène Lupin, the stolen goods, the secret passage, and Sherlock
      Holmes. It was only at the close of the repast, when the conversation had
      drifted to other subjects, that Velmont took any part in it. Then he was,
      by turns, amusing and grave, talkative and pensive. And all his remarks
      seemed to be directed to the young girl. But she, quite absorbed, did not
      appear to hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coffee was served on the terrace overlooking the court of honor and the
      flower garden in front of the principal façade. The regimental band played
      on the lawn, and scores of soldiers and peasants wandered through the
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nelly had not forgotten, for one moment, Lupin&rsquo;s solemn promise:
      &ldquo;To-morrow, at three o&rsquo;clock, everything will be returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock! And the hands of the great clock in the right wing of
      the castle now marked twenty minutes to three. In spite of herself, her
      eyes wandered to the clock every minute. She also watched Velmont, who was
      calmly swinging to and fro in a comfortable rocking chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes to three!....Five minutes to three!....Nelly was impatient and
      anxious. Was it possible that Arsène Lupin would carry out his promise at
      the appointed hour, when the castle, the courtyard, and the park were
      filled with people, and at the very moment when the officers of the law
      were pursuing their investigations? And yet....Arsène Lupin had given her
      his solemn promise. &ldquo;It will be exactly as he said,&rdquo; thought she, so
      deeply was she impressed with the authority, energy and assurance of that
      remarkable man. To her, it no longer assumed the form of a miracle, but,
      on the contrary, a natural incident that must occur in the ordinary course
      of events. She blushed, and turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three o&rsquo;clock! The great clock struck slowly: one.... two....
      three....Horace Velmont took out his watch, glanced at the clock, then
      returned the watch to his pocket. A few seconds passed in silence; and
      then the crowd in the courtyard parted to give passage to two wagons, that
      had just entered the park-gate, each drawn by two horses. They were
      army-wagons, such as are used for the transportation of provisions, tents,
      and other necessary military stores. They stopped in front of the main
      entrance, and a commissary-sergeant leaped from one of the wagons and
      inquired for Mon. Devanne. A moment later, that gentleman emerged from the
      house, descended the steps, and, under the canvas covers of the wagons,
      beheld his furniture, pictures and ornaments carefully packaged and
      arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      When questioned, the sergeant produced an order that he had received from
      the officer of the day. By that order, the second company of the fourth
      battalion were commanded to proceed to the crossroads of Halleux in the
      forest of Arques, gather up the furniture and other articles deposited
      there, and deliver same to Monsieur Georges Devanne, owner of the
      Thibermesnil castle, at three o&rsquo;clock. Signed: Col. Beauvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the crossroads,&rdquo; explained the sergeant, &ldquo;we found everything ready,
      lying on the grass, guarded by some passers-by. It seemed very strange,
      but the order was imperative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the officers examined the signature. He declared it a forgery; but
      a clever imitation. The wagons were unloaded, and the goods restored to
      their proper places in the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this commotion, Nelly had remained alone at the extreme end of the
      terrace, absorbed by confused and distracted thoughts. Suddenly, she
      observed Velmont approaching her. She would have avoided him, but the
      balustrade that surrounded the terrace cut off her retreat. She was
      cornered. She could not move. A gleam of sunshine, passing through the
      scant foliage of a bamboo, lighted up her beautiful golden hair. Some one
      spoke to her in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not kept my promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arsène Lupin stood close to her. No one else was near. He repeated, in a
      calm, soft voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not kept my promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He expected a word of thanks, or at least some slight movement that would
      betray her interest in the fulfillment of his promise. But she remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her scornful attitude annoyed Arsène Lupin; and he realized the vast
      distance that separated him from Miss Nelly, now that she had learned the
      truth. He would gladly have justified himself in her eyes, or at least
      pleaded extenuating circumstances, but he perceived the absurdity and
      futility of such an attempt. Finally, dominated by a surging flood of
      memories, he murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how long ago that was! You remember the long hours on the deck of the
      &lsquo;Provence.&rsquo; Then, you carried a rose in your hand, a white rose like the
      one you carry to-day. I asked you for it. You pretended you did not hear
      me. After you had gone away, I found the rose&mdash;forgotten, no doubt&mdash;and
      I kept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply. She seemed to be far away. He continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In memory of those happy hours, forget what you have learned since.
      Separate the past from the present. Do not regard me as the man you saw
      last night, but look at me, if only for a moment, as you did in those
      far-off days when I was Bernard d&rsquo;Andrezy, for a short time. Will you,
      please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes and looked at him as he had requested. Then, without
      saying a word, she pointed to a ring he was wearing on his forefinger.
      Only the ring was visible; but the setting, which was turned toward the
      palm of his hand, consisted of a magnificent ruby. Arsène Lupin blushed.
      The ring belonged to Georges Devanne. He smiled bitterly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. Nothing can be changed. Arsène Lupin is now and always
      will be Arsène Lupin. To you, he cannot be even so much as a memory.
      Pardon me....I should have known that any attention I may now offer you is
      simply an insult. Forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped aside, hat in hand. Nelly passed before him. He was inclined to
      detain her and beseech her forgiveness. But his courage failed, and he
      contented himself by following her with his eyes, as he had done when she
      descended the gangway to the pier at New York. She mounted the steps
      leading to the door, and disappeared within the house. He saw her no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cloud obscured the sun. Arsène Lupin stood watching the imprints of her
      tiny feet in the sand. Suddenly, he gave a start. Upon the box which
      contained the bamboo, beside which Nelly had been standing, he saw the
      rose, the white rose which he had desired but dared not ask for.
      Forgotten, no doubt&mdash;it, also! But how&mdash;designedly or through
      distraction? He seized it eagerly. Some of its petals fell to the ground.
      He picked them up, one by one, like precious relics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I have nothing more to do here. I must think
      of my safety, before Sherlock Holmes arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The park was deserted, but some gendarmes were stationed at the park-gate.
      He entered a grove of pine trees, leaped over the wall, and, as a short
      cut to the railroad station, followed a path across the fields. After
      walking about ten minutes, he arrived at a spot where the road grew
      narrower and ran between two steep banks. In this ravine, he met a man
      traveling in the opposite direction. It was a man about fifty years of
      age, tall, smooth-shaven, and wearing clothes of a foreign cut. He carried
      a heavy cane, and a small satchel was strapped across his shoulder. When
      they met, the stranger spoke, with a slight English accent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, monsieur, is this the way to the castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, straight ahead, and turn to the left when you come to the
      wall. They are expecting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend Devanne told us last night that you were coming, and I am
      delighted to be the first to welcome you. Sherlock Holmes has no more
      ardent admirer than.... myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a touch of irony in his voice that he quickly regretted, for
      Sherlock Holmes scrutinized him from head to foot with such a keen,
      penetrating eye that Arsène Lupin experienced the sensation of being
      seized, imprisoned and registered by that look more thoroughly and
      precisely than he had ever been by a camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My negative is taken now,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and it will be useless to use a
      disguise with that man. He would look right through it. But, I wonder, has
      he recognized me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They bowed to each other as if about to part. But, at that moment, they
      heard a sound of horses&rsquo; feet, accompanied by a clinking of steel. It was
      the gendarmes. The two men were obliged to draw back against the
      embankment, amongst the brushes, to avoid the horses. The gendarmes passed
      by, but, as they followed each other at a considerable distance, they were
      several minutes in doing so. And Lupin was thinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all depends on that question: has he recognized me? If so, he will
      probably take advantage of the opportunity. It is a trying situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the last horseman had passed, Sherlock Holmes stepped forth and
      brushed the dust from his clothes. Then, for a moment, he and Arsène Lupin
      gazed at each other; and, if a person could have seen them at that moment,
      it would have been an interesting sight, and memorable as the first
      meeting of two remarkable men, so strange, so powerfully equipped, both of
      superior quality, and destined by fate, through their peculiar attributes,
      to hurl themselves one at the other like two equal forces that nature
      opposes, one against the other, in the realms of space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Englishman said: &ldquo;Thank you, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
	 <p>
	 &ldquo;You are quite welcome, replied Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
	 </p>
    <p>
      They parted. Lupin went toward the railway station, and Sherlock Holmes
      continued on his way to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The local officers had given up the investigation after several hours of
      fruitless efforts, and the people at the castle were awaiting the arrival
      of the English detective with a lively curiosity. At first sight, they
      were a little disappointed on account of his commonplace appearance, which
      differed so greatly from the pictures they had formed of him in their own
      minds. He did not in any way resemble the romantic hero, the mysterious
      and diabolical personage that the name of Sherlock Holmes had evoked in
      their imaginations. However, Mon. Devanne exclaimed with much gusto:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, you are here! I am delighted to see you. It is a
      long-deferred pleasure. Really, I scarcely regret what has happened, since
      it affords me the opportunity to meet you. But, how did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I sent my automobile to meet you at the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An official reception, eh? with music and fireworks! Oh! no, not for me.
      That is not the way I do business,&rdquo; grumbled the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech disconcerted Devanne, who replied, with a forced smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately, the business has been greatly simplified since I wrote to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The robbery took place last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not announced my intended visit, it is probable the robbery
      would not have been committed last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, or some other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in that case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lupin would have been trapped,&rdquo; said the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my furniture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would not have been carried away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but my goods are here. They were brought back at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By two army-wagons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes put on his cap and adjusted his satchel. Devanne
      exclaimed, anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your goods have been returned; Arsène Lupin is far away&mdash;there is
      nothing for me to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is. I need your assistance. What happened yesterday, may
      happen again to-morrow, as we do not know how he entered, or how he
      escaped, or why, a few hours later, he returned the goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of a problem to be solved quickened the interest of Sherlock
      Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let us make a search&mdash;at once&mdash;and alone, if
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Devanne understood, and conducted the Englishman to the salon. In a dry,
      crisp voice, in sentences that seemed to have been prepared in advance,
      Holmes asked a number of questions about the events of the preceding
      evening, and enquired also concerning the guests and the members of the
      household. Then he examined the two volumes of the &ldquo;Chronique,&rdquo; compared
      the plans of the subterranean passage, requested a repetition of the
      sentences discovered by Father Gélis, and then asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was yesterday the first time you have spoken those two sentences to any
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had never communicated then to Horace Velmont?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, order the automobile. I must leave in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; within that time, Arsène Lupin solved the problem that you placed
      before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I.... placed before him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Arsène Lupin or Horace Velmont&mdash;same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. Ah! the scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let us see,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;last night at ten o&rsquo;clock, you furnished
      Lupin with the information that he lacked, and that he had been seeking
      for many weeks. During the night, he found time to solve the problem,
      collect his men, and rob the castle. I shall be quite as expeditious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked from end to end of the room, in deep thought, then sat down,
      crossed his long legs and closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devanne waited, quite embarrassed. Thought he: &ldquo;Is the man asleep? Or is
      he only meditating?&rdquo; However, he left the room to give some orders, and
      when he returned he found the detective on his knees scrutinizing the
      carpet at the foot of the stairs in the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look.... there.... spots from a candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right&mdash;and quite fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will also find them at the top of the stairs, and around the
      cabinet that Arsène Lupin broke into, and from which he took the bibelots
      that he afterward placed in this armchair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you conclude from that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. These facts would doubtless explain the cause for the
      restitution, but that is a side issue that I cannot wait to investigate.
      The main question is the secret passage. First, tell me, is there a chapel
      some two or three hundred metres from the castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a ruined chapel, containing the tomb of Duke Rollo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your chauffer to wait for us near that chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My chauffer hasn&rsquo;t returned. If he had, they would have informed me. Do
      you think the secret passage runs to the chapel? What reason have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask you, monsieur,&rdquo; interrupted the detective, &ldquo;to furnish me
      with a ladder and a lantern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you require a ladder and a lantern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Devanne, somewhat disconcerted by this crude logic, rang the bell. The two
      articles were given with the sternness and precision of military commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place the ladder against the bookcase, to the left of the word
      Thibermesnil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Devanne placed the ladder as directed, and the Englishman continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More to the left.... to the right....There!....Now, climb up.... All the
      letters are in relief, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, turn the letter I one way or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one? There are two of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Devanne took hold of the letter, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, it turns toward the right. Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes did not reply to the question, but continued his
      directions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, take the letter B. Move it back and forth as you would a bolt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Devanne did so, and, to his great surprise, it produced a clicking sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Now, we will go to the other end of the word
      Thibermesnil, try the letter I, and see if it will open like a wicket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a certain degree of solemnity, Devanne seized the letter. It opened,
      but Devanne fell from the ladder, for the entire section of the bookcase,
      lying between the first and last letters of the words, turned on a pivot
      and disclosed the subterranean passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes said, coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Devanne, as he rose to his feet, &ldquo;not hurt, only
      bewildered. I can&rsquo;t understand now.... those letters turn.... the secret
      passage opens....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Doesn&rsquo;t that agree exactly with the formula given by Sully?
      Turn one eye on the bee that shakes, the other eye will lead to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Louis the sixteenth?&rdquo; asked Devanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis the sixteenth was a clever locksmith. I have read a book he wrote
      about combination locks. It was a good idea on the part of the owner of
      Thibermesnil to show His Majesty a clever bit of mechanism. As an aid to
      his memory, the king wrote: 3-4-11, that is to say, the third, fourth and
      eleventh letters of the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I understand that. It explains how Lupin got out of the room,
      but it does not explain how he entered. And it is certain he came from the
      outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes lighted his lantern, and stepped into the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! All the mechanism is exposed here, like the works of a clock, and
      the reverse side of the letters can be reached. Lupin worked the
      combination from this side&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof is there of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proof? Why, look at that puddle of oil. Lupin foresaw that the wheels
      would require oiling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he know about the other entrance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as I know it,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into that dark passage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but are you sure you can find the way out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my eyes closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first, they descended twelve steps, then twelve more, and, farther on,
      two other flights of twelve steps each. Then they walked through a long
      passageway, the brick walls of which showed the marks of successive
      restorations, and, in spots, were dripping with water. The earth, also,
      was very damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are passing under the pond,&rdquo; said Devanne, somewhat nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, they came to a stairway of twelve steps, followed by three others
      of twelve steps each, which they mounted with difficulty, and then found
      themselves in a small cavity cut in the rock. They could go no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; muttered Holmes, &ldquo;nothing but bare walls. This is provoking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go back,&rdquo; said Devanne. &ldquo;I have seen enough to satisfy me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Englishman raised his eye and uttered a sigh of relief. There, he
      saw the same mechanism and the same word as before. He had merely to work
      the three letters. He did so, and a block of granite swung out of place.
      On the other side, this granite block formed the tombstone of Duke Rollo,
      and the word &ldquo;Thibermesnil&rdquo; was engraved on it in relief. Now, they were
      in the little ruined chapel, and the detective said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other eye leads to God; that means, to the chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is marvelous!&rdquo; exclaimed Devanne, amazed at the clairvoyance and
      vivacity of the Englishman. &ldquo;Can it be possible that those few words were
      sufficient for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; declared Holmes, &ldquo;they weren&rsquo;t even necessary. In the chart in the
      book of the National Library, the drawing terminates at the left, as you
      know, in a circle, and at the right, as you do not know, in a cross. Now,
      that cross must refer to the chapel in which we now stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Devanne could not believe his ears. It was all so new, so novel to
      him. He exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is incredible, miraculous, and yet of a childish simplicity! How is it
      that no one has ever solved the mystery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because no one has ever united the essential elements, that is to say,
      the two books and the two sentences. No one, but Arsène Lupin and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Father Gélis and I knew all about those things, and, likewise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes smiled, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Devanne, everybody cannot solve riddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying for ten years to accomplish what you did in ten
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! I am used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They emerged from the chapel, and found an automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s an auto waiting for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is mine,&rdquo; said Devanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours? You said your chauffeur hadn&rsquo;t returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They approached the machine, and Mon. Devanne questioned the chauffer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edouard, who gave you orders to come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it was Monsieur Velmont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon. Velmont? Did you meet him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near the railway station, and he told me to come to the chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To come to the chapel! What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To wait for you, monsieur, and your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Devanne and Holmes exchanged looks, and Mon. Devanne said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew the mystery would be a simple one for you. It is a delicate
      compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of satisfaction lighted up the detective&rsquo;s serious features for a
      moment. The compliment pleased him. He shook his head, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clever man! I knew that when I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him a short time ago&mdash;on my way from the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you knew it was Horace Velmont&mdash;I mean, Arsène Lupin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. I wonder how it came&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I supposed it was&mdash;from a certain ironical speech he made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you allowed him to escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did. And yet I had everything on my side, such as five
      gendarmes who passed us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrableu!&rdquo; cried Devanne. &ldquo;You should have taken advantage of the
      opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, monsieur,&rdquo; said the Englishman, haughtily, &ldquo;when I encounter an
      adversary like Arsène Lupin, I do not take advantage of chance
      opportunities, I create them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But time pressed, and since Lupin had been so kind as to send the
      automobile, they resolved to profit by it. They seated themselves in the
      comfortable limousine; Edouard took his place at the wheel, and away they
      went toward the railway station. Suddenly, Devanne&rsquo;s eyes fell upon a
      small package in one of the pockets of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what is that? A package! Whose is it? Why, it is for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is addressed: Sherlock Holmes, from Arsène Lupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman took the package, opened it, and found that it contained a
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with an angry gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A watch,&rdquo; said Devanne. &ldquo;How did it come there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is your watch! Arsène Lupin returns your watch! But, in order to
      return it, he must have taken it. Ah! I see! He took your watch! That is a
      good one! Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; watch stolen by Arsène Lupin! Mon Dieu! that is
      funny! Really.... you must excuse me....I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He roared with laughter, unable to control himself. After which, he said,
      in a tone of earnest conviction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clever man, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman never moved a muscle. On the way to Dieppe, he never spoke
      a word, but fixed his gaze on the flying landscape. His silence was
      terrible, unfathomable, more violent than the wildest rage. At the railway
      station, he spoke calmly, but in a voice that impressed one with the vast
      energy and will power of that famous man. He said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Yes, he is a clever man, but some day I shall have the pleasure of
placing on his shoulder the hand I now offer to you, Monsieur Devanne.
And I believe that Arsène Lupin and Sherlock Holmes will meet again
some day. Yes, the world is too small&mdash;we will meet&mdash;we must meet&mdash;and
then&mdash;&rdquo;

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
