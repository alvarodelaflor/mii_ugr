Abstract    :
              ATM-9302475  Finlayson-Pitts         The reactions of alkali halide particles in
              the atmosphere to  form photochemically reactive species is currently of great 
              interest.  Such particles, particularly sodium chloride, are not  only
              ubiquitous in the marine boundary layer, but also have been  found in the
              plumes from burning oil wells in Kuwait, in the  exhaust from solid rocket
              propellants, and in emissions from the El  Chichon volcano.  In this project
              studies of the kinetics and  mechanisms of the reactions of alkali halide with
              various nitrogen  oxides and ozone will be undertaken.  This will be
              accomplished  through the use of the relatively new but potentially very
              valuable  technique of diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT), 
              which allows one to follow both the gases and the surfaces of the  salt in real
              time as the reactions are occurring.  The emphasis  will be on understanding
              the fundamental chemical processes,  especially how the nature of the surface
              controls reactions of  atmospheric importance.
