Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of cosmogenic radionuclides in                     
              the GISP2 ice core.  Accelerator mass spectrometry                             
              techniques will be used to measure Beryllium-10, Aluminum-26                   
              and Chlorine-36 isotopes at selected depths on the core.                       
              The results will be applied to dating ice cores and deducing                   
              the history of solar activity and variations in the                            
              geomagnetic field.  These analyses will also be useful for                     
              studying climatic history through effects of atmospheric                       
              circulation and atmospheric chemistry on nuclide deposition.
