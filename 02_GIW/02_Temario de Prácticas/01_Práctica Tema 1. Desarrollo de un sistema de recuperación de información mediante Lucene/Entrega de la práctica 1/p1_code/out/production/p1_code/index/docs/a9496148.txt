Abstract    :
              Streaming potentials and streaming                                             
              currents exist in bones when they                                              
              are bent or subjected to                                                       
              hydrostatic pressure.  It is                                                   
              thought that changes in these                                                  
              signals during bone remodeling may                                             
              be important in controlling the                                                
              bone remodeling process.  This                                                 
              project will develop an analytical                                             
              macroscopic model of streaming                                                 
              potential and streaming current                                                
              generation based on cortical                                                   
              microarchitecture of bone. The                                                 
              model will be validated using                                                  
              existing data and data from                                                    
              experiments that are proposed as                                               
              part of this study.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This work is important since the                                               
              results could lead to an                                                       
              understanding of how electric                                                  
              fields are involved in the fracture                                            
              healing process and how electric                                               
              fields might be used to control                                                
              osteoporosis.
