Abstract    :
                   In this project, the investigator will study nonconforming                
              multigrid methods.  Robust multigrid algorithms for various                    
              finite element methods in elasticity will be developed, the                    
              performance of which will not deteriorate as the material becomes              
              nearly incompressible.  A nonconforming multigrid method for a                 
              fluid flow free-boundary problem will also be studied.  Numerical              
              experiments will be performed for these problems.  In addition,                
              some theoretical topics (conforming and nonconforming) such as                 
              pointwise convergence of multigrid methods, and multigrid methods              
              that can overcome the pollution effects of singular solutions,                 
              will also be investigated.                                                     
                   The results of this research will lead to efficient                       
              algorithms for the solution of large-scale computational problems              
              in fluid mechanics and elasticity.  They will find many                        
              applications in various fields of engineering and physics.
