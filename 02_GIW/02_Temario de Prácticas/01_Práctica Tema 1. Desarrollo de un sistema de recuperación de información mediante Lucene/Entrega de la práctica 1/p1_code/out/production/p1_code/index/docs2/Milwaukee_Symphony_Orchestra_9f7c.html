<p>From September through June, Classics Series concerts are performed Friday through Sunday in Uihlein Hall at the Marcus Center. Maestro Delfs conducts a number of the programs, and guest conductors have included <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/l/Helmuth_Rilling_a7d4.html" title="Helmuth Rilling">Helmuth Rilling</a> and former artist-in-residence <a href="../../../../articles/n/i/c/Nicholas_McGegan_f65e.html" title="Nicholas McGegan">Nicholas McGegan</a>. The series includes performances of works by Mendelssohn, Stravinsky, Brahms, Dvořák and Beethoven.

<p>In 2004, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra premiered Classical Connections, a series offering a new format to meet the diverse interests of symphony patrons and Milwaukee’s cultural attendees. This new subscription series takes place on Thursday evenings and has a relaxed format, with a host providing informational commentary from the stage; technical effects like videos and supertitles; pre-concert social activities; and a shorter, 75-minute performance without intermission.</p>
<p>The Kinderkonzert Series, formerly Sunday for Families, introduces children ages 3-10 to classical music. These performances combine themes to which young listeners can easily relate with music, multimedia, guest artists, scenery, and animation. A month before each concert, "Learn and Play" materials are mailed to subscribers. These packets offer playful and educational activities for families to do together in preparation for the concert. The Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra League sponsors activities before the concert, where children can visit the Musical Instrument Petting Zoo, learn to conduct the beat using brightly colored scarves, and create their own dances.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/m/i/l/Milwaukee_Symphony_Orchestra_9f7c.html" title="Edit section: Touring">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Touring</span></h2>
<p>The MSO made a minor media splash when it toured <a href="../../../../articles/c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> in 1999, the first American symphony orchestra to do so since the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba_99df.html" title="United States embargo against Cuba">U.S. embargo against Cuba</a> was implemented in 1962.</p>
<p>In an era when many major orchestras have curtailed their state touring programs, the MSO remains committed to its role as Wisconsin's state orchestra. For more than 37 years, the MSO's State Tour travels to communities throughout Wisconsin, offering many adult and youth audiences unique opportunities to hear live classical music. Among other destinations, the Orchestra has traveled to <a href="../../../../articles/f/i/s/Fish_Creek%2C_Wisconsin_5a5b.html" title="Fish Creek, Wisconsin">Fish Creek</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/n/Fond_du_Lac%2C_Wisconsin_76e4.html" title="Fond du Lac, Wisconsin">Fond du Lac</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marinette%2C_Wisconsin_3766.html" title="Marinette, Wisconsin">Marinette</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/p/Ripon%2C_Wisconsin_6b3b.html" title="Ripon, Wisconsin">Ripon</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/r/h/i/Rhinelander%2C_Wisconsin_44bc.html" title="Rhinelander, Wisconsin">Rhinelander</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/r/Three_Lakes%2C_Wisconsin_4cb9.html" title="Three Lakes, Wisconsin">Three Lakes</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/w/e/s/West_Bend%2C_Wisconsin_0b48.html" title="West Bend, Wisconsin">West Bend</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/w/h/i/Whitewater%2C_Wisconsin_2029.html" title="Whitewater, Wisconsin">Whitewater</a>, Wisconsin, and <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/p/Naperville%2C_Illinois_73c5.html" title="Naperville, Illinois">Naperville, Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>Through the annual Hometown Holiday Tour, the MSO brings free concerts to Milwaukee area residents. Designed to bring music to those who might not be able to attend a concert in the Marcus Center, the tour has played at hospitals and community centers.</p>

<p>The MSO offers a number of educational opportunities including the Arts in Community Education (ACE) program. ACE is designed to develop and build critical and creative thinking skills in children through an integration of the arts within their daily curriculum. Supporting Wisconsin's Academic Content and Performance Standards, ACE uses the arts to emphasize lessons learned in other academic subjects, including math, science, social studies, and language arts. ACE embraces diverse artistic heritages in the community by collaborating with partner groups composed of local artists from cultural organizations including the <a href="../../../../articles/s/k/y/Skylight_Opera_Theatre_60ae.html" title="Skylight Opera Theatre">Skylight Opera Theatre</a>, American Indian Center and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/l/Milwaukee_Ballet_719a.html" title="Milwaukee Ballet">Milwaukee Ballet</a>.</p>
<p>The MSO also offers concerts for youth and high school students. The MSO's education programs served over 40,000 children from Milwaukee, southeastern Wisconsin and northern <a href="../../../../articles/i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>. Schools attending youth concerts received free in-school presentations by MSO League docents and MSO musicians to prepare and help them understand the performances. Students attending high school concerts were invited to participate in talk-backs with the conductor, guest artists and MSO musicians. The MSO and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/l/Milwaukee_Public_Schools_a8ec.html" title="Milwaukee Public Schools">Milwaukee Public Schools</a> continued a partnership that provided MPS students the opportunity to attend MSO youth or high school concerts for substantially reduced ticket prices.</p>
<p>The MSO offers several opportunities for Milwaukee area students to develop their performance abilities. The Private Lesson Scholarship Program provides area music students with financial need the unique opportunity to study one-on-one with professional orchestra players from the MSO for free. Furthermore, young violin students are invited to audition for the annual Bach Double Violin Concerto Competition, the winners of which perform at a spring ACE concert. Gifted Wisconsin high school instrumental musicians who win the MSO's annual Young Artist Competition receive the honor of performing as soloists or as stand partners in an evening concert with the MSO.</p>
