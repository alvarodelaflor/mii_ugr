Abstract    :
              This award supports a project designed to confirm that the East                
              Antarctic ice sheet has become thinner in the past 100,000 years.              
              The project will measure the exposure ages and erosion rates of                
              Antarctic rocks from Southern Victoria Land using in-situ produced             
              Beryllium-10 and Aluminum-26, in collaboration with Drs. Gunter                
              Faure and Teresa Mensing at the Ohio State University.  This new               
              surface exposure dating method is applicable to various                        
              geomorphological subjects and is especially useful in Antarctica.              
              Measurement of other in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides,                     
              particularly 14C and 21Ne, will be performed for selected samples.
