Abstract    :
              This research grant will support the development of a                          
              biodegradable polymeric matrix that would support the growth of                
              osteoblasts and osteoblast precursors.  The intent is to have                  
              simultaneous polymer degradation and cell growth and maturation                
              leading to the generation of bone-like tissues.  The objectives                
              are 1) to design and develop degradable three-dimensional                      
              matrices of polymers and polymer/ceramic materials and to fully                
              characterize these novel matrices; 2) to seed osteoblast cells                 
              onto the newly created three-dimensional biodegradable polymer                 
              matrices and study osteoblast adherence and growth in vitro; and               
              3) to study osteoblast-polymer matrices in an in vivo environment              
              characterizing their ability to be osteoinductive or                           
              osteoconductive.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This research is important since it could lead to the development              
              of new materials for use in non-unions of bones, surgical                      
              arthrodeses, cranio-facial defect procedures, and coating for                  
              orthopedic implants.
