Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a detailed magnetic study of seafloor spreading in the                 
              Cayman Trough, Caribbean Sea using high denisty aeromagnetic                   
              data and three dimensional magnetic inversion procedures. The                  
              trough offers a look at seafloor spreading and crustal                         
              accretion from three unique persepctives; as an indicator of                   
              relative motion sand tectonic desplacements within a complex                   
              plate boundary zone, as an example of accretion occurring under                
              extreme thermal, tectonic and spreading conditions, and as an                  
              example of anisolated spreading cell whose development can be                  
              mapped from the time of its formation.
