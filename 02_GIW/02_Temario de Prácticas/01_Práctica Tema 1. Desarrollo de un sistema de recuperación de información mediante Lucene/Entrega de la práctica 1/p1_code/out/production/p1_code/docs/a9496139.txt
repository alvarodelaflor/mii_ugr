Abstract    :
                 Our understanding of the dynamics of the                                    
              magnetosphere will be advanced by this                                         
              proposed research in three ways: (1) to carry                                  
              to a new and significantly greater level of                                    
              completeness the assembly of the basic engine                                  
              that drives magnetospheric circulation, (2)                                    
              specify the global geometry of magnetospheric                                  
              circulation for times when it appears to                                       
              operate in reverse (up to 50% of the time),                                    
              and (3) graphically demonstrate and                                            
              quantitatively evaluate over an entire                                         
              magnetospheric cross section the coupling by                                   
              which the solar wind powers the engine that                                    
              drives magnetospheric circulation.  The first                                  
              project will combine for the first time                                        
              separate and distinct models for three major                                   
              components of the engine (voltage generator,                                   
              current generator, and ring current energy                                     
              storage element) into a single, physically                                     
              explicit, self-consistent, quantitative model                                  
              that predicts the distribution of currents and                                 
              voltages over the ionospheric surfaces on                                      
              which magnetospheric circulation is expressed.                                 
              The second project will produce quantitatively                                 
              explicit, global magnetic field maps showing                                   
              for the first time how hemispherical asymmetry                                 
              plays a critical role in establishing reverse                                  
              circulation.  The third project will produce                                   
              empirically derived magnetic field maps (from                                  
              IMP 8 magnetic field data) showing how the                                     
              solar wind magnetic field - the coupling field                                 
              - drapes over and attaches to the                                              
              magnetosphere to deliver the power to the                                      
              engine that drives magnetospheric circulation.
