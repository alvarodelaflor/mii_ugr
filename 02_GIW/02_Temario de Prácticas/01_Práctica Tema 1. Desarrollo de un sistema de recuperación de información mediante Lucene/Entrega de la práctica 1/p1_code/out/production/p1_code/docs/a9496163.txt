Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a cultural anthropologist studying the                 
              social relations of economic activity in the main wholesale fish               
              market in Tokyo, Japan.  The theory to be tested involves the                  
              nature of economic relationships, since the market has many                    
              personalized, vertically-coordinated economic ties.  In normal                 
              market theory such a market should be composed of many short-term              
              competitive relations, yet this market is striking for its                     
              institutionalization of cooperative relationships between                      
              apparently competing firms.  The methodology includes participant              
              observation and formal interviews as well as a survey of market                
              participants.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will shed light on how                   
              cooperation can facilitate economic activity in a competitive                  
              environment.  It will also have practical significance in                      
              illustrating how Japanese customs operate in a very large,                     
              heavily capitalized fish market.
