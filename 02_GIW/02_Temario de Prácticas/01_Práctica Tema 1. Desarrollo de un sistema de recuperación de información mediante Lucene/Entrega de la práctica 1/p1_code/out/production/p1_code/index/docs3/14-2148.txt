Auguste Dupin, in his little back\r\n      library, or book-closet, _au troisi\xc3\xa8me_, No. 33, _Rue Dun\xc3\xb4t,\r\n      Faubourg St. Germain_. For one hour at least we had maintained a\r\n      profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have\r\n      seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies\r\n      of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For\r\n      myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which\r\n      had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier\r\n      period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and\r\n      the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rog\xc3\xaat. I looked upon\r\n      it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of\r\n      our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance,\r\n      Monsieur G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, the Prefect of the Parisian police.\r\n\r\n      We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much\r\n      of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we\r\n      had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the\r\n      dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but\r\n      sat down again, without doing so, upon G.\xe2\x80\x98s saying that he had\r\n      called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend,\r\n      about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of\r\n      trouble.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is any point requiring reflection,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Dupin, as he\r\n      forebore to enkindle the wick, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall examine it to better\r\n      purpose in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat is another of your odd notions,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prefect, who had\r\n      a fashion of calling every thing \xe2\x80\x9codd\xe2\x80\x9d that was beyond his\r\n      comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9coddities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe,\r\n      and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the difficulty now?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing more in the\r\n      assassination way, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very\r\n      simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it\r\n      sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like\r\n      to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSimple and odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all\r\n      been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet\r\n      baffles us altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at\r\n      fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense you do talk!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prefect, laughing\r\n      heartily.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the mystery is a little too plain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA little too self-evident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94ho! ho! ho!\xe2\x80\x9d roared our visitor,\r\n      profoundly amused, \xe2\x80\x9coh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what, after all, is the matter on hand?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I will tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prefect, as he gave a long,\r\n      steady and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me\r\n      caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest\r\n      secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now\r\n      hold, were it known that I confided it to any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cProceed,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOr not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then; I have received personal information, from a very\r\n      high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has\r\n      been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who\r\n      purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take\r\n      it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this known?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dupin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is clearly inferred,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prefect, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the nature\r\n      of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results\r\n      which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      possession; that is to say, from his employing it as he must\r\n      design in the end to employ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBe a little more explicit,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its\r\n      holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is\r\n      immensely valuable.\xe2\x80\x9d The Prefect was fond of the cant of\r\n      diplomacy.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cStill I do not quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who\r\n      shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a\r\n      personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder\r\n      of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage\r\n      whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut this ascendancy,\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed, \xe2\x80\x9cwould depend upon the\r\n      robber\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the loser\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the robber. Who\r\n      would dare\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe thief,\xe2\x80\x9d said G., \xe2\x80\x9cis the Minister D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, who dares all things,\r\n      those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of\r\n      the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in\r\n      question\xe2\x80\x94a letter, to be frank\xe2\x80\x94had been received by the personage\r\n      robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she\r\n      was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted\r\n      personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.\r\n      After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she\r\n      was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The\r\n      address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus\r\n      unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the\r\n      Minister D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper,\r\n      recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion\r\n      of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some\r\n      business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he\r\n      produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens\r\n      it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close\r\n      juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen\r\n      minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he\r\n      takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.\r\n      Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention\r\n      to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at\r\n      her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\n      no importance\xe2\x80\x94upon the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHere, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin to me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have precisely what you\r\n      demand to make the ascendancy complete\xe2\x80\x94the robber\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of\r\n      the loser\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the robber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prefect; \xe2\x80\x9cand the power thus attained has, for\r\n      some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very\r\n      dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly\r\n      convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.\r\n      But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to\r\n      despair, she has committed the matter to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThan whom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\n      more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even\r\n      imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou flatter me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prefect; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is possible that\r\n      some such opinion may have been entertained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cas you observe, that the letter is still\r\n      in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and\r\n      not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With\r\n      the employment the power departs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said G.; \xe2\x80\x9cand upon this conviction I proceeded. My first\r\n      care was to make thorough search of the minister\xe2\x80\x99s hotel; and\r\n      here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching\r\n      without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of\r\n      the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect\r\n      our design.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are quite au fait in these investigations.\r\n      The Parisian police have done this thing often before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of\r\n      the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently\r\n      absent from home all night. His servants are by no means\r\n      numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master\xe2\x80\x99s apartment,\r\n      and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have\r\n      keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet\r\n      in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the\r\n      greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in\r\n      ransacking the D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention\r\n      a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the\r\n      search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a\r\n      more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated\r\n      every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible\r\n      that the paper can be concealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut is it not possible,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cthat although the letter\r\n      may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he\r\n      may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis is barely possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe present peculiar\r\n      condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues\r\n      in which D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 is known to be involved, would render the instant\r\n      availability of the document\xe2\x80\x94its susceptibility of being produced\r\n      at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice\xe2\x80\x94a point of nearly equal importance with its\r\n      possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIts susceptibility of being produced?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, of being destroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed; \xe2\x80\x9cthe paper is clearly then upon the premises.\r\n      As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider\r\n      that as out of the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEntirely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prefect. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been twice waylaid, as if\r\n      by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own\r\n      inspection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have spared yourself this trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\r\n      I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have\r\n      anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot altogether a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said G., \xe2\x80\x9cbut then he\xe2\x80\x99s a poet, which I\r\n      take to be only one remove from a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his\r\n      meerschaum, \xe2\x80\x9calthough I have been guilty of certain doggrel\r\n      myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you detail,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthe particulars of your search.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_.\r\n      I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire\r\n      building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to\r\n      each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We\r\n      opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a\r\n      properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is\r\n      impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a \xe2\x80\x98secret\xe2\x80\x99 drawer to\r\n      escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There\r\n      is a certain amount of bulk\xe2\x80\x94of space\xe2\x80\x94to be accounted for in every\r\n      cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line\r\n      could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The\r\n      cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me\r\n      employ. From the tables we removed the tops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece\r\n      of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an\r\n      article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within\r\n      the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of\r\n      bedposts are employed in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBy no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient\r\n      wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we\r\n      were obliged to proceed without noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut you could not have removed\xe2\x80\x94you could not have taken to\r\n      pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been\r\n      possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter\r\n      may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in\r\n      shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it\r\n      might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did\r\n      not take to pieces all the chairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not; but we did better\xe2\x80\x94we examined the rungs of every\r\n      chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every\r\n      description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful\r\n      microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we\r\n      should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of\r\n      gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.\r\n      Any disorder in the glueing\xe2\x80\x94any unusual gaping in the\r\n      joints\xe2\x80\x94would have sufficed to insure detection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the\r\n      plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as\r\n      the curtains and carpets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat of course; and when we had absolutely completed every\r\n      particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house\r\n      itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we\r\n      numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each\r\n      individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two\r\n      houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe two houses adjoining!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have had a\r\n      great deal of trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe had; but the reward offered is prodigious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou include the grounds about the houses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAll the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively\r\n      little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and\r\n      found it undisturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou looked among D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98s papers, of course, and into the books of\r\n      the library?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only\r\n      opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume,\r\n      not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the\r\n      fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the\r\n      thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate\r\n      admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of\r\n      the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled\r\n      with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should\r\n      have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the\r\n      hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with\r\n      the needles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou explored the floors beneath the carpets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards\r\n      with the microscope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the paper on the walls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou looked into the cellars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been making a miscalculation, and the\r\n      letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you are right there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prefect. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Dupin,\r\n      what would you advise me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo make a thorough re-search of the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat is absolutely needless,\xe2\x80\x9d replied G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not more sure\r\n      that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have no better advice to give you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have, of\r\n      course, an accurate description of the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,\r\n      proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and\r\n      especially of the external appearance of the missing document.\r\n      Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his\r\n      departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever\r\n      known the good gentleman before.\r\n\r\n      In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found\r\n      us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and\r\n      entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, but G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have\r\n      at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as\r\n      overreaching the Minister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cConfound him, say I\xe2\x80\x94yes; I made the re-examination, however, as\r\n      Dupin suggested\xe2\x80\x94but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would\r\n      be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow much was the reward offered, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dupin.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a very great deal\xe2\x80\x94a very liberal reward\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say\r\n      how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n      mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any\r\n      one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming\r\n      of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been\r\n      lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more\r\n      than I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his\r\n      meerschaum, \xe2\x80\x9cI really\xe2\x80\x94think, G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, you have not exerted\r\n      yourself\xe2\x80\x94to the utmost in this matter. You might\xe2\x80\x94do a little\r\n      more, I think, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x94in what way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94puff, puff\xe2\x80\x94you might\xe2\x80\x94puff, puff\xe2\x80\x94employ counsel in the\r\n      matter, eh?\xe2\x80\x94puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell\r\n      of Abernethy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo; hang Abernethy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a\r\n      certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this\r\n      Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an\r\n      ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his\r\n      case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We will suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said the miser, \xe2\x80\x98that his symptoms are such\r\n      and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take!\xe2\x80\x99 said Abernethy, \xe2\x80\x98why, take advice, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prefect, a little discomposed, \xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly\r\n      willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give\r\n      fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a\r\n      check-book, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may as well fill me up a check for the amount\r\n      mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely\r\n      thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and\r\n      motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth,\r\n      and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then,\r\n      apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen,\r\n      and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and\r\n      signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across\r\n      the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and\r\n      deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire,\r\n      took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary\r\n      grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling\r\n      hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling\r\n      and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from\r\n      the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable\r\n      since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.\r\n\r\n      When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Parisian police,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care exceedingly able in their\r\n      way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly\r\n      versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to\r\n      demand. Thus, when G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 detailed to us his mode of searching the\r\n      premises at the Hotel D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, I felt entire confidence in his having\r\n      made a satisfactory investigation\xe2\x80\x94so far as his labors extended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSo far as his labors extended?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe measures adopted were not only the best\r\n      of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the\r\n      letter been deposited within the range of their search, these\r\n      fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I merely laughed\xe2\x80\x94but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe measures, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwere good in their kind, and\r\n      well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to\r\n      the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious\r\n      resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to\r\n      which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by\r\n      being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a\r\n      schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight\r\n      years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of \xe2\x80\x98even and\r\n      odd\xe2\x80\x99 attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is\r\n      played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of\r\n      these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or\r\n      odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he\r\n      loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the\r\n      school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay\r\n      in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his\r\n      opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and,\r\n      holding up his closed hand, asks, \xe2\x80\x98are they even or odd?\xe2\x80\x99 Our\r\n      schoolboy replies, \xe2\x80\x98odd,\xe2\x80\x99 and loses; but upon the second trial he\r\n      wins, for he then says to himself, \xe2\x80\x98the simpleton had them even\r\n      upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just\r\n      sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will\r\n      therefore guess odd;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a\r\n      simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus:\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and,\r\n      in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first\r\n      impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first\r\n      simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is\r\n      too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting\r\n      it even as before. I will therefore guess even;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94he guesses even,\r\n      and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his\r\n      fellows termed \xe2\x80\x98lucky,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94what, in its last analysis, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is merely,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9can identification of the reasoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      intellect with that of his opponent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dupin; \xe2\x80\x9cand, upon inquiring of the boy by what\r\n      means he effected the thorough identification in which his\r\n      success consisted, I received answer as follows: \xe2\x80\x98When I wish to\r\n      find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is\r\n      any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the\r\n      expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance\r\n      with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or\r\n      sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or\r\n      correspond with the expression.\xe2\x80\x99 This response of the schoolboy\r\n      lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been\r\n      attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and\r\n      to Campanella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the identification,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cof the reasoner\xe2\x80\x99s intellect\r\n      with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright,\r\n      upon the accuracy with which the opponent\xe2\x80\x99s intellect is\r\n      admeasured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor its practical value it depends upon this,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dupin;\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cand the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by\r\n      default of this identification, and, secondly, by\r\n      ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the\r\n      intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their\r\n      own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden,\r\n      advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They\r\n      are right in this much\xe2\x80\x94that their own ingenuity is a faithful\r\n      representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the\r\n      individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the\r\n      felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above\r\n      their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no\r\n      variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when\r\n      urged by some unusual emergency\xe2\x80\x94by some extraordinary reward\xe2\x80\x94they\r\n      extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without\r\n      touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of\r\n      D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all\r\n      this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the\r\n      microscope and dividing the surface of the building into\r\n      registered square inches\xe2\x80\x94what is it all but an exaggeration of\r\n      the application of the one principle or set of principles of\r\n      search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding\r\n      human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his\r\n      duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for\r\n      granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,\xe2\x80\x94not exactly in\r\n      a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg\xe2\x80\x94but, at least, in some\r\n      out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of\r\n      thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a\r\n      gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that\r\n      such recherch\xc3\xa9s nooks for concealment are adapted only for\r\n      ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary\r\n      intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the\r\n      article concealed\xe2\x80\x94a disposal of it in this recherch\xc3\xa9 manner,\xe2\x80\x94is,\r\n      in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its\r\n      discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether\r\n      upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers;\r\n      and where the case is of importance\xe2\x80\x94or, what amounts to the same\r\n      thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now\r\n      understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined\r\n      letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      examination\xe2\x80\x94in other words, had the principle of its concealment\r\n      been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect\xe2\x80\x94its\r\n      discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.\r\n      This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the\r\n      remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the\r\n      Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All\r\n      fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty\r\n      of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are\r\n      fools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut is this really the poet?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two brothers,\r\n      I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The\r\n      Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential\r\n      Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and\r\n      mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he\r\n      could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the\r\n      mercy of the Prefect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cby these opinions, which have been\r\n      contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at\r\n      naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical\r\n      reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Il y a \xc3\xa0 pari\xc3\xa8r,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98que\r\n      toute id\xc3\xa9e publique, toute convention re\xc3\xa7ue est une sottise, car\r\n      elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.\xe2\x80\x99 The mathematicians, I\r\n      grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error\r\n      to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its\r\n      promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for\r\n      example, they have insinuated the term \xe2\x80\x98analysis\xe2\x80\x99 into\r\n      application to algebra. The French are the originators of this\r\n      particular deception; but if a term is of any importance\xe2\x80\x94if words\r\n      derive any value from applicability\xe2\x80\x94then \xe2\x80\x98analysis\xe2\x80\x99 conveys\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98algebra\xe2\x80\x99 about as much as, in Latin, \xe2\x80\x98ambitus\xe2\x80\x99 implies\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98ambition,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98_religio_\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98religion,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98_homines honesti_\xe2\x80\x99 a set\r\n      of _honorable_ men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a quarrel on hand, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwith some of the\r\n      algebraists of Paris; but proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason\r\n      which is cultivated in any especial form other than the\r\n      abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed\r\n      by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form\r\n      and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to\r\n      observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in\r\n      supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra,\r\n      are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious\r\n      that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been\r\n      received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.\r\n      What is true of relation\xe2\x80\x94of form and quantity\xe2\x80\x94is often grossly\r\n      false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it\r\n      is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the\r\n      whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of\r\n      motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have\r\n      not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their\r\n      values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which\r\n      are only truths within the limits of relation. But the\r\n      mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as\r\n      if they were of an absolutely general applicability\xe2\x80\x94as the world\r\n      indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Mythology,\xe2\x80\x99 mentions an analogous source of error, when he says\r\n      that \xe2\x80\x98although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget\r\n      ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing\r\n      realities.\xe2\x80\x99 With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans\r\n      themselves, the \xe2\x80\x98Pagan fables\xe2\x80\x99 are believed, and the inferences\r\n      are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an\r\n      unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet\r\n      encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of\r\n      equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point\r\n      of his faith that x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal\r\n      to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you\r\n      please, that you believe occasions may occur where x2+px is not\r\n      altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you\r\n      mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond\r\n      doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his\r\n      last observations, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if the Minister had been no more than a\r\n      mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of\r\n      giving me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician\r\n      and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with\r\n      reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew\r\n      him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I\r\n      considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial\r\n      modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I\r\n      reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His\r\n      frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the\r\n      Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses,\r\n      to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus\r\n      the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, in\r\n      fact, did finally arrive\xe2\x80\x94the conviction that the letter was not\r\n      upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought,\r\n      which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now,\r\n      concerning the invariable principle of policial action in\r\n      searches for articles concealed\xe2\x80\x94I felt that this whole train of\r\n      thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister.\r\n      It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks\r\n      of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to\r\n      see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would\r\n      be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes,\r\n      to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in\r\n      fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to\r\n      simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of\r\n      choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect\r\n      laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was\r\n      just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its\r\n      being so very self-evident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember his merriment well. I really thought\r\n      he would have fallen into convulsions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe material world,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dupin, \xe2\x80\x9cabounds with very strict\r\n      analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has\r\n      been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may\r\n      be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a\r\n      description. The principle of the vis inerti\xc3\xa6, for example, seems\r\n      to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true\r\n      in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in\r\n      motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is\r\n      commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter,\r\n      that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more\r\n      constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of\r\n      inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more\r\n      embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of\r\n      their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street\r\n      signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of\r\n      attention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have never given the matter a thought,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a game of puzzles,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is played upon a\r\n      map. One party playing requires another to find a given word\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      name of town, river, state or empire\xe2\x80\x94any word, in short, upon the\r\n      motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game\r\n      generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the\r\n      most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as\r\n      stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the\r\n      other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards\r\n      of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively\r\n      obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous\r\n      with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to\r\n      pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and\r\n      too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears,\r\n      somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He\r\n      never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister\r\n      had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the\r\n      whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world\r\n      from perceiving it.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and\r\n      discriminating ingenuity of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94; upon the fact that the document\r\n      must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good\r\n      purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect,\r\n      that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      ordinary search\xe2\x80\x94the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this\r\n      letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and\r\n      sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFull of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green\r\n      spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at\r\n      the Ministerial hotel. I found D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 at home, yawning, lounging,\r\n      and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last\r\n      extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic\r\n      human being now alive\xe2\x80\x94but that is only when nobody sees him.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented\r\n      the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I\r\n      cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while\r\n      seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he\r\n      sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters\r\n      and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few\r\n      books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny,\r\n      I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAt length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a\r\n      trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by\r\n      a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the\r\n      middle of the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four\r\n      compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary\r\n      letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn\r\n      nearly in two, across the middle\xe2\x80\x94as if a design, in the first\r\n      instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered,\r\n      or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the\r\n      D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 cipher _very_ conspicuously, and was addressed, in a\r\n      diminutive female hand, to D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, the minister, himself. It was\r\n      thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into\r\n      one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to\r\n      be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all\r\n      appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect\r\n      had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and\r\n      black, with the D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 cipher; there it was small and red, with the\r\n      ducal arms of the S\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 family. Here, the address, to the Minister,\r\n      diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain\r\n      royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone\r\n      formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of\r\n      these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and\r\n      torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true\r\n      methodical habits of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and so suggestive of a design to delude\r\n      the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the\r\n      document\xe2\x80\x94these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive\r\n      situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor,\r\n      and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I\r\n      had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly\r\n      corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to\r\n      suspect.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I\r\n      maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a\r\n      topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite\r\n      him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this\r\n      examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and\r\n      arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a\r\n      discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have\r\n      entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed\r\n      them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the\r\n      broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having\r\n      been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a\r\n      reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed\r\n      the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to\r\n      me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out,\r\n      re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good morning, and\r\n      took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the\r\n      table.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed,\r\n      quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus\r\n      engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard\r\n      immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded\r\n      by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified\r\n      mob. D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In\r\n      the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it\r\n      in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards\r\n      externals,) which I had carefully prepared at my\r\n      lodgings\xe2\x80\x94imitating the D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 cipher, very readily, by means of a\r\n      seal formed of bread.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic\r\n      behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of\r\n      women and children. It proved, however, to have been without\r\n      ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a\r\n      drunkard. When he had gone, D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 came from the window, whither I\r\n      had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view.\r\n      Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a\r\n      man in my own pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut what purpose had you,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cin replacing the letter by\r\n      a fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit,\r\n      to have seized it openly, and departed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dupin, \xe2\x80\x9cis a desperate man, and a man of nerve.\r\n      His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his\r\n      interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never\r\n      have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of\r\n      Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart\r\n      from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions.\r\n      In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For\r\n      eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has\r\n      now him in hers\xe2\x80\x94since, being unaware that the letter is not in\r\n      his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was.\r\n      Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political\r\n      destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than\r\n      awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus\r\n      Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of\r\n      singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the\r\n      present instance I have no sympathy\xe2\x80\x94at least no pity\xe2\x80\x94for him who\r\n      descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of\r\n      genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know\r\n      the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her\r\n      whom the Prefect terms \xe2\x80\x98a certain personage\xe2\x80\x99 he is reduced to\r\n      opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow? did you put any thing particular in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior\r\n      blank\xe2\x80\x94that would have been insulting. D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, at Vienna once, did me\r\n      an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I\r\n      should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in\r\n      regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I\r\n      thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is well acquainted\r\n      with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet\r\n      the words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 Un dessein si funeste,\r\n      S\xe2\x80\x99il n\xe2\x80\x99est digne d\xe2\x80\x99Atr\xc3\xa9e, est digne de Thyeste.\r\n\r\n      They are to be found in Cr\xc3\xa9billon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Atr\xc3\xa9e.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE\r\n\r\n\r\nTruth is stranger than fiction.\xe2\x80\x94_Old Saying_\r\n\r\n      Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental\r\n      investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isits\xc3\xb6ornot, a work\r\n      which (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at\r\n      all, even in Europe; and which has never been quoted, to my\r\n      knowledge, by any American\xe2\x80\x94if we except, perhaps, the author of\r\n      the \xe2\x80\x9cCuriosities of American Literature\xe2\x80\x9d;\xe2\x80\x94having had occasion, I\r\n      say, to turn over some pages of the first-mentioned very\r\n      remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to discover that\r\n      the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error\r\n      respecting the fate of the vizier\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Scheherazade, as\r\n      that fate is depicted in the \xe2\x80\x9cArabian Nights\xe2\x80\x9d; and that the\r\n      _d\xc3\xa9nouement_ there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as\r\n      it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much\r\n      farther.\r\n\r\n      For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the\r\n      inquisitive reader to the \xe2\x80\x9cIsits\xc3\xb6ornot\xe2\x80\x9d itself; but in the\r\n      meantime, I shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I\r\n      there discovered.\r\n\r\n      It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a\r\n      certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not\r\n      only puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the\r\n      prophet, to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his\r\n      dominions, and the next morning to deliver her up to the\r\n      executioner.\r\n\r\n      Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with\r\n      a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit\r\n      upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was\r\n      interrupted one afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit\r\n      from his grand vizier, to whose daughter, it appears, there had\r\n      occurred an idea.\r\n\r\n      Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would\r\n      either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty,\r\n      or perish, after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the\r\n      attempt.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year\r\n      (which makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her\r\n      father, the grand vizier, to make an offer to the king of her\r\n      hand. This hand the king eagerly accepts\xe2\x80\x94(he had intended to take\r\n      it at all events, and had put off the matter from day to day,\r\n      only through fear of the vizier),\xe2\x80\x94but, in accepting it now, he\r\n      gives all parties very distinctly to understand, that, grand\r\n      vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of\r\n      giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When,\r\n      therefore, the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king,\r\n      and did actually marry him despite her father\xe2\x80\x99s excellent advice\r\n      not to do any thing of the kind\xe2\x80\x94when she would and did marry him,\r\n      I say, will I, nill I, it was with her beautiful black eyes as\r\n      thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.\r\n\r\n      It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading\r\n      Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in\r\n      her mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I\r\n      forget what specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch\r\n      sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy\r\n      conversation from bed to bed; and, a little before cock-crowing,\r\n      she took care to awaken the good monarch, her husband (who bore\r\n      her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on\r\n      the morrow),\xe2\x80\x94she managed to awaken him, I say, (although on\r\n      account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion, he slept\r\n      well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a\r\n      black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone,\r\n      of course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that\r\n      this history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade,\r\n      in the nature of things could not finish it just then, since it\r\n      was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung\xe2\x80\x94a thing very\r\n      little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel!\r\n\r\n      The king\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say,\r\n      even over his sound religious principles, induced him for this\r\n      once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning,\r\n      for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it\r\n      fared in the end with the black cat (a black cat, I think it was)\r\n      and the rat.\r\n\r\n      The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only\r\n      put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat\r\n      was blue) but before she well knew what she was about, found\r\n      herself deep in the intricacies of a narration, having reference\r\n      (if I am not altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green\r\n      wings) that went, in a violent manner, by clockwork, and was\r\n      wound up with an indigo key. With this history the king was even\r\n      more profoundly interested than with the other\xe2\x80\x94and, as the day\r\n      broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all the queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing),\r\n      there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as\r\n      before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a\r\n      similar accident with a similar result; and then the next\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      then again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch,\r\n      having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his\r\n      vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights,\r\n      either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or\r\n      gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more\r\n      probable) breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father\r\n      confessor. At all events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally\r\n      descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole seven\r\n      baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up\r\n      from under the trees in the garden of Eden; Scheherazade, I say,\r\n      finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.\r\n\r\n      Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it\r\n      upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant\xe2\x80\x94but\r\n      alas! like a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than\r\n      true, and I am indebted altogether to the \xe2\x80\x9cIsits\xc3\xb6ornot\xe2\x80\x9d for the\r\n      means of correcting the error. \xe2\x80\x9cLe mieux,\xe2\x80\x9d says a French proverb,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cest l\xe2\x80\x99ennemi du bien,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had\r\n      inherited the seven baskets of talk, I should have added that she\r\n      put them out at compound interest until they amounted to\r\n      seventy-seven.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I\r\n      quote the language of the \xe2\x80\x9cIsits\xc3\xb6ornot\xe2\x80\x9d at this point, verbatim)\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that all this little difficulty\r\n      about the bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is\r\n      so happily repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great\r\n      indiscretion in withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry\r\n      to say, snores\xe2\x80\x94a thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion\r\n      of Sinbad the sailor. This person went through numerous other and\r\n      more interesting adventures than those which I related; but the\r\n      truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their\r\n      narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short\xe2\x80\x94a grievous\r\n      piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that Allah will\r\n      forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my great\r\n      neglect\xe2\x80\x94and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in\r\n      order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible\r\n      noise, I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases)\r\n      with the sequel of this very remarkable story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsits\xc3\xb6ornot,\xe2\x80\x9d expressed no very particular intensity of\r\n      gratification; but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at\r\n      length ceased snoring, and finally said, \xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9cHoo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      when the queen, understanding these words (which are no doubt\r\n      Arabic) to signify that he was all attention, and would do his\r\n      best not to snore any more\xe2\x80\x94the queen, I say, having arranged\r\n      these matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into\r\n      the history of Sinbad the sailor:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98At length, in my old age,\xe2\x80\x99 [these are the words of Sinbad\r\n      himself, as retailed by Scheherazade]\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98at length, in my old age,\r\n      and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became\r\n      once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries;\r\n      and one day, without acquainting any of my family with my design,\r\n      I packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious\r\n      and least bulky, and, engaging a porter to carry them, went with\r\n      him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival of any chance\r\n      vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region\r\n      which I had not as yet explored.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down\r\n      beneath some trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of\r\n      perceiving a ship, but during several hours we saw none whatever.\r\n      At length I fancied that I could hear a singular buzzing or\r\n      humming sound; and the porter, after listening awhile, declared\r\n      that he also could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and\r\n      then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that the object\r\n      which caused it was approaching us. At length, on the edge of the\r\n      horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in\r\n      size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a\r\n      great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came\r\n      toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of\r\n      foam around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea\r\n      through which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended\r\n      far off into the distance.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length\r\n      was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and\r\n      it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace, O\r\n      most sublime and munificent of the Caliphs. Its body, which was\r\n      unlike that of ordinary fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a\r\n      jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated\r\n      above the water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak\r\n      that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated beneath\r\n      the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and\r\n      then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely\r\n      covered with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in\r\n      misty weather. The back was flat and nearly white, and from it\r\n      there extended upwards of six spines, about half the length of\r\n      the whole body.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98This horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive;\r\n      but, as if to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with\r\n      at least four score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets\r\n      like those of the green dragon-fly, and were arranged all around\r\n      the body in two rows, one above the other, and parallel to the\r\n      blood-red streak, which seemed to answer the purpose of an\r\n      eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger\r\n      than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with\r\n      the greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by\r\n      necromancy\xe2\x80\x94for it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like\r\n      a duck, nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the\r\n      manner of a vessel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do\r\n      the eels. Its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike,\r\n      only, not far from the latter, were two small holes that served\r\n      for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out its thick\r\n      breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,\r\n      disagreeable noise.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but\r\n      it was even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a\r\n      nearer look, we perceived upon the creature\xe2\x80\x99s back a vast number\r\n      of animals about the size and shape of men, and altogether much\r\n      resembling them, except that they wore no garments (as men do),\r\n      being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an ugly uncomfortable\r\n      covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight to the\r\n      skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put\r\n      them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads\r\n      were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I\r\n      thought might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon\r\n      discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I\r\n      therefore concluded they were contrivances designed, by their\r\n      great weight, to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe\r\n      upon their shoulders. Around the necks of the creatures were\r\n      fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no doubt,) such as\r\n      we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely stiffer, so\r\n      that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their\r\n      heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time;\r\n      and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their\r\n      noses\xe2\x80\x94a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively\r\n      in an awful degree.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood,\r\n      it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and\r\n      emitted from it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense\r\n      cloud of smoke, and a noise that I can compare to nothing but\r\n      thunder. As the smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd\r\n      man-animals standing near the head of the large beast with a\r\n      trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to his mouth) he\r\n      presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable accents,\r\n      that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they not\r\n      come altogether through the nose.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply,\r\n      as I could in no manner understand what was said; and in this\r\n      difficulty I turned to the porter, who was near swooning through\r\n      affright, and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of\r\n      monster it was, what it wanted, and what kind of creatures those\r\n      were that so swarmed upon its back. To this the porter replied,\r\n      as well as he could for trepidation, that he had once before\r\n      heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel demon, with bowels\r\n      of sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means\r\n      of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the things upon its back\r\n      were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a\r\n      little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had their\r\n      uses, however evil\xe2\x80\x94for, through the torture they caused the beast\r\n      by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree\r\n      of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and\r\n      so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis account determined me to take to my heels, and, without\r\n      once even looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the\r\n      hills, while the porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an\r\n      opposite direction, so that, by these means, he finally made his\r\n      escape with my bundles, of which I have no doubt he took\r\n      excellent care\xe2\x80\x94although this is a point I cannot determine, as I\r\n      do not remember that I ever beheld him again.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin\r\n      (who had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon\r\n      overtaken, bound hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which\r\n      immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home\r\n      to peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being\r\n      useless, I made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to\r\n      secure the goodwill of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and\r\n      who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows. I succeeded\r\n      so well in this endeavor that, in a few days, the creature\r\n      bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor, and in the end even\r\n      went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was\r\n      vain enough to denominate its language; so that, at length, I was\r\n      enabled to converse with it readily, and came to make it\r\n      comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt\r\n      grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to me, one day after\r\n      dinner\xe2\x80\x94but I beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your\r\n      majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so\r\n      the man-animals were called; I presume because their language\r\n      formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of\r\n      the rooster). With your permission, I will translate. \xe2\x80\x98Washish\r\n      squashish,\xe2\x80\x99 and so forth:\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, \xe2\x80\x98I am happy to find, my\r\n      dear Sinbad, that you are really a very excellent fellow; we are\r\n      now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the\r\n      globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the world, I will\r\n      strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the\r\n      beast.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIsits\xc3\xb6ornot,\xe2\x80\x9d the king turned over from his left side to his\r\n      right, and said:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you\r\n      omitted, hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know\r\n      I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair\r\n      Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSinbad went on in this manner with his narrative\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I thanked the\r\n      man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much at\r\n      home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the\r\n      ocean; although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the\r\n      world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we\r\n      went\xe2\x80\x94so to say\xe2\x80\x94either up hill or down hill all the time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat I think, was very singular,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, it is quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Scheherazade.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the king; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, pray, be so good as\r\n      to go on with the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The beast,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Sinbad to the\r\n      caliph, \xe2\x80\x98swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at\r\n      length, we arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in\r\n      circumference, but which, nevertheless, had been built in the\r\n      middle of the sea by a colony of little things like\r\n      caterpillars.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*1)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Leaving this island,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sinbad\xe2\x80\x94(for Scheherazade, it must be\r\n      understood, took no notice of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s ill-mannered\r\n      ejaculation) \xe2\x80\x98leaving this island, we came to another where the\r\n      forests were of solid stone, and so hard that they shivered to\r\n      pieces the finest-tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut\r\n      them down.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*2)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no\r\n      attention, continued in the language of Sinbad.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where\r\n      there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty\r\n      miles within the bowels of the earth, and that contained a\r\n      greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces\r\n      than are to be found in all Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs\r\n      of these palaces there hung myriads of gems, like diamonds, but\r\n      larger than men; and in among the streets of towers and pyramids\r\n      and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony, and\r\n      swarming with fish that had no eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*3)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty\r\n      mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted\r\n      metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long\r\n      (*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a\r\n      quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the\r\n      heavens, and it became darker than the darkest midnight; so that\r\n      when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles\r\n      from the mountain, it was impossible to see the whitest object,\r\n      however close we held it to our eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*5)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until\r\n      we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed\r\n      reversed\xe2\x80\x94for we here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which,\r\n      more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water, there\r\n      flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      (*6)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHoo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSome hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the\r\n      atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our\r\n      own does feather.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*7)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFiddle de dee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cProceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at\r\n      the most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there\r\n      meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This\r\n      river was of unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than\r\n      that of amber. It was from three to six miles in width; and its\r\n      banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in\r\n      perpendicular height, were crowned with ever-blossoming trees and\r\n      perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that made the whole territory\r\n      one gorgeous garden; but the name of this luxuriant land was the\r\n      Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable death.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*8)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came\r\n      to another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of\r\n      monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads.\r\n      These hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil,\r\n      of a funnel shape, and line the sides of them with rocks, so\r\n      disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly, when\r\n      trodden upon by other animals, thus precipitating them into the\r\n      monster\xe2\x80\x99s dens, where their blood is immediately sucked, and\r\n      their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an\r\n      immense distance from \xe2\x80\x9cthe caverns of death."\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*9)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with\r\n      vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10)\r\n      There were others that sprang from the substance of other\r\n      vegetables; (*11) others that derived their substance from the\r\n      bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again, there were others\r\n      that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others that moved\r\n      from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still more\r\n      wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and\r\n      moved their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable\r\n      passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures, and confining\r\n      them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of\r\n      appointed tasks.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*15)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the\r\n      bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and\r\n      erudition, that they give daily instructions in the science of\r\n      geometry to the wise men of the empire. The king of the place\r\n      having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult\r\n      problems, they were solved upon the spot\xe2\x80\x94the one by the bees, and\r\n      the other by the birds; but the king keeping their solution a\r\n      secret, it was only after the most profound researches and labor,\r\n      and the writing of an infinity of big books, during a long series\r\n      of years, that the men-mathematicians at length arrived at the\r\n      identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the\r\n      bees and by the birds.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*16)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh my!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found\r\n      ourselves close upon another, from whose shores there flew over\r\n      our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and\r\n      forty miles long; so that, although they flew a mile during every\r\n      minute, it required no less than four hours for the whole flock\r\n      to pass over us\xe2\x80\x94in which there were several millions of millions\r\n      of fowl.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*17)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOh fy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us\r\n      great annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a\r\n      fowl of another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs\r\n      which I met in my former voyages; for it was bigger than the\r\n      biggest of the domes on your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of\r\n      Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive,\r\n      but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious\r\n      fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth,\r\n      shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the\r\n      monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house\r\n      from which it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of\r\n      which we distinctly saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in\r\n      a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited\r\n      them. We shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening\r\n      the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely gave a snort\r\n      or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy\r\n      sack which proved to be filled with sand!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cStuff!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It was just after this adventure that we encountered a\r\n      continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which,\r\n      nevertheless, was supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue\r\n      cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*18)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThat, now, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I have read\r\n      something of the kind before, in a book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in\r\n      between the legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found\r\n      ourselves in a wonderful country indeed, which, I was informed by\r\n      the man-animal, was his own native land, inhabited by things of\r\n      his own species. This elevated the man-animal very much in my\r\n      esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel ashamed of the\r\n      contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him; for I\r\n      found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most\r\n      powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19)\r\n      which, no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful\r\n      writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of\r\n      imagination!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very\r\n      singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones\r\n      were iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he\r\n      had black stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard\r\n      a diet, he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more\r\n      weighty than the grandest temple in this city, at a rate\r\n      surpassing that of the flight of most birds.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*20)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTwattle!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but\r\n      bigger than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and\r\n      brick; her blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she\r\n      was nearly related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate\r\n      nothing but wood or black stones. This hen brought forth very\r\n      frequently, a hundred chickens in the day; and, after birth, they\r\n      took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of\r\n      their mother.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*21)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFal lal!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of\r\n      brass and wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity\r\n      that he would have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with\r\n      the exception of the great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22)\r\n      Another of these magi constructed (of like material) a creature\r\n      that put to shame even the genius of him who made it; for so\r\n      great were its reasoning powers that, in a second, it performed\r\n      calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required\r\n      the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)\r\n      But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a\r\n      mighty thing that was neither man nor beast, but which had brains\r\n      of lead, intermixed with a black matter like pitch, and fingers\r\n      that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it\r\n      would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies\r\n      of the Koran in an hour, and this with so exquisite a precision,\r\n      that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from\r\n      another by the breadth of the finest hair. This thing was of\r\n      prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew the\r\n      mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised\r\n      equally for evil and for good.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRidiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in\r\n      his veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of\r\n      sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his\r\n      dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had\r\n      the faculty of converting the common metals into gold, without\r\n      even looking at them during the process. (*25) Another had such a\r\n      delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible.\r\n      (*26) Another had such quickness of perception that he counted\r\n      all the separate motions of an elastic body, while it was\r\n      springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred\r\n      millions of times in a second.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*27)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAbsurd!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody\r\n      ever yet saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish\r\n      their arms, kick out their legs, fight, or even get up and dance\r\n      at his will. (*28) Another had cultivated his voice to so great\r\n      an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of\r\n      the world to the other. (*29) Another had so long an arm that he\r\n      could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter at Bagdad\xe2\x80\x94or\r\n      indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded the\r\n      lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at\r\n      his call; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another\r\n      took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another\r\n      constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31)\r\n      Another made ice in a red-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the\r\n      sun to paint his portrait, and the sun did. (*33) Another took\r\n      this luminary with the moon and the planets, and having first\r\n      weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed into their depths\r\n      and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were\r\n      made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a\r\n      necromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their\r\n      commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects\r\n      that do not exist at all, or that for twenty millions of years\r\n      before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from\r\n      the face of creation.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (*34)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPreposterous!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise\r\n      magi,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner\r\n      disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions\r\n      on the part of her husband\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98the wives and daughters of these\r\n      eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and\r\n      refined; and would be every thing that is interesting and\r\n      beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and from\r\n      which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and\r\n      fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities\r\n      come in certain shapes, and some in others\xe2\x80\x94but this of which I\r\n      speak has come in the shape of a crotchet.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA what?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A crotchet\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Scheherazade. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98One of the evil genii, who\r\n      are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into\r\n      the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we\r\n      describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the\r\n      protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the\r\n      small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they say, is in the\r\n      direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long\r\n      possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country,\r\n      the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a\r\n      woman from a dromedary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand that, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t. You have\r\n      already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day,\r\n      too, I perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been\r\n      married?\xe2\x80\x94my conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And\r\n      then that dromedary touch\xe2\x80\x94do you take me for a fool? Upon the\r\n      whole, you might as well get up and be throttled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      These words, as I learn from the \xe2\x80\x9cIsits\xc3\xb6ornot,\xe2\x80\x9d both grieved and\r\n      astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of\r\n      scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she\r\n      submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however,\r\n      great consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from\r\n      the reflection that much of the history remained still untold,\r\n      and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for\r\n      him a most righteous reward, in depriving him of many\r\n      inconceivable adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways; \r\n  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the\r\n  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, _which have\r\n  a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Joseph Glanville_.\r\n\r\n      We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some\r\n      minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at length, \xe2\x80\x9cand I could have guided you\r\n      on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about\r\n      three years past, there happened to me an event such as never\r\n      happened to mortal man\xe2\x80\x94or at least such as no man ever survived\r\n      to tell of\xe2\x80\x94and the six hours of deadly terror which I then\r\n      endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a _very_\r\n      old man\xe2\x80\x94but I am not. It took less than a single day to change\r\n      these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and\r\n      to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion,\r\n      and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look\r\n      over this little cliff without getting giddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The \xe2\x80\x9clittle cliff,\xe2\x80\x9d upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown\r\n      himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung\r\n      over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his\r\n      elbow on its extreme and slippery edge\xe2\x80\x94this \xe2\x80\x9clittle cliff\xe2\x80\x9d arose,\r\n      a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some\r\n      fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath\r\n      us. Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of\r\n      its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous\r\n      position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the\r\n      ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance\r\n      upward at the sky\xe2\x80\x94while I struggled in vain to divest myself of\r\n      the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger\r\n      from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason\r\n      myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the\r\n      distance.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou must get over these fancies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guide, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have\r\n      brought you here that you might have the best possible view of\r\n      the scene of that event I mentioned\xe2\x80\x94and to tell you the whole\r\n      story with the spot just under your eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe are now,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in that particularizing manner which\r\n      distinguished him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe are now close upon the Norwegian coast\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n      the sixty-eighth degree of latitude\xe2\x80\x94in the great province of\r\n      Nordland\xe2\x80\x94and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon\r\n      whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up\r\n      a little higher\xe2\x80\x94hold on to the grass if you feel giddy\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose\r\n      waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the\r\n      Nubian geographer\xe2\x80\x99s account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama\r\n      more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To\r\n      the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay\r\n      outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black\r\n      and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more\r\n      forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its\r\n      white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just\r\n      opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a\r\n      distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible\r\n      a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position\r\n      was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was\r\n      enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose another of\r\n      smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at\r\n      various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.\r\n\r\n      The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more\r\n      distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about\r\n      it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward\r\n      that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed\r\n      trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight,\r\n      still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a\r\n      short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction\xe2\x80\x94as\r\n      well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was\r\n      little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe island in the distance,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cis called by\r\n      the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to\r\n      the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm,\r\n      Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off\xe2\x80\x94between Moskoe and\r\n      Vurrgh\xe2\x80\x94are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These\r\n      are the true names of the places\xe2\x80\x94but why it has been thought\r\n      necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can\r\n      understand. Do you hear anything? Do you see any change in the\r\n      water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to\r\n      which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we\r\n      had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from\r\n      the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and\r\n      gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of\r\n      buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I\r\n      perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_ character of the\r\n      ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set\r\n      to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a\r\n      monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed\xe2\x80\x94to its\r\n      headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as\r\n      Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between\r\n      Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the\r\n      vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand\r\n      conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied\r\n      convulsion\xe2\x80\x94heaving, boiling, hissing\xe2\x80\x94gyrating in gigantic and\r\n      innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the\r\n      eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes\r\n      except in precipitous descents.\r\n\r\n      In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical\r\n      alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and\r\n      the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks\r\n      of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These\r\n      streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and\r\n      entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory\r\n      motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of\r\n      another more vast. Suddenly\xe2\x80\x94very suddenly\xe2\x80\x94this assumed a distinct\r\n      and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile in\r\n      diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt\r\n      of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth\r\n      of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could\r\n      fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water,\r\n      inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,\r\n      speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering\r\n      motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half\r\n      shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of\r\n      Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.\r\n\r\n      The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I\r\n      threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an\r\n      excess of nervous agitation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said I at length, to the old man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis _can_ be nothing\r\n      else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstr\xc3\xb6m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSo it is sometimes termed,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe Norwegians call it the\r\n      Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me\r\n      for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most\r\n      circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception\r\n      either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene\xe2\x80\x94or of\r\n      the wild bewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the\r\n      beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in\r\n      question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have\r\n      been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are\r\n      some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be\r\n      quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly\r\n      feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBetween Lofoden and Moskoe,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cthe depth of the water is\r\n      between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side,\r\n      toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a\r\n      convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on\r\n      the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is\r\n      flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe\r\n      with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to\r\n      the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful\r\n      cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the\r\n      vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship\r\n      comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and\r\n      carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the\r\n      rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are\r\n      thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquility are only at\r\n      the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but\r\n      a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the\r\n      stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it\r\n      is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts,\r\n      and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it\r\n      before they were within its reach. It likewise happens\r\n      frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are\r\n      overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to\r\n      describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless\r\n      struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to\r\n      swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne\r\n      down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large\r\n      stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the\r\n      current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if\r\n      bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist\r\n      of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This\r\n      stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea\xe2\x80\x94it being\r\n      constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645,\r\n      early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such\r\n      noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the\r\n      coast fell to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this\r\n      could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of\r\n      the vortex. The \xe2\x80\x9cforty fathoms\xe2\x80\x9d must have reference only to\r\n      portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or\r\n      Lofoden. The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m must be\r\n      immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is\r\n      necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into\r\n      the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of\r\n      Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling\r\n      Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with\r\n      which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of\r\n      belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it\r\n      appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest\r\n      ship of the line in existence, coming within the influence of\r\n      that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather\r\n      the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.\r\n\r\n      The attempts to account for the phenomenon\xe2\x80\x94some of which, I\r\n      remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal\xe2\x80\x94now wore\r\n      a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally\r\n      received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among\r\n      the Ferroe islands, \xe2\x80\x9chave no other cause than the collision of\r\n      waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of\r\n      rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it\r\n      precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the\r\n      flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result\r\n      of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which\r\n      is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94These are the words\r\n      of the Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that\r\n      in the centre of the channel of the Maelstr\xc3\xb6m is an abyss\r\n      penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.\r\n      This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed,\r\n      my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the\r\n      guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it\r\n      was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the\r\n      Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former\r\n      notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I\r\n      agreed with him\xe2\x80\x94for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes\r\n      altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of\r\n      the abyss.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou have had a good look at the whirl now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cand if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee,\r\n      and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that\r\n      will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMyself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of\r\n      about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of\r\n      fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all\r\n      violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper\r\n      opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but\r\n      among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the only\r\n      ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as\r\n      I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the\r\n      southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,\r\n      and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over\r\n      here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety,\r\n      but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single\r\n      day, what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together\r\n      in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of desperate\r\n      speculation\xe2\x80\x94the risk of life standing instead of labor, and\r\n      courage answering for capital.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast\r\n      than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take\r\n      advantage of the fifteen minutes\xe2\x80\x99 slack to push across the main\r\n      channel of the Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m, far above the pool, and then drop\r\n      down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen,\r\n      where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used to\r\n      remain until nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed\r\n      and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition without\r\n      a steady side wind for going and coming\xe2\x80\x94one that we felt sure\r\n      would not fail us before our return\xe2\x80\x94and we seldom made a\r\n      mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were\r\n      forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm,\r\n      which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to\r\n      remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to\r\n      a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the\r\n      channel too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we\r\n      should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for\r\n      the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently, that, at\r\n      length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been\r\n      that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents\xe2\x80\x94here\r\n      to-day and gone to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94which drove us under the lee of Flimen,\r\n      where, by good luck, we brought up.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we\r\n      encountered \xe2\x80\x98on the grounds\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it is a bad spot to be in, even in\r\n      good weather\xe2\x80\x94but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the\r\n      Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m itself without accident; although at times my heart\r\n      has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind\r\n      or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we\r\n      thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we\r\n      could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My\r\n      eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout\r\n      boys of my own. These would have been of great assistance at such\r\n      times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\n      somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart\r\n      to let the young ones get into the danger\xe2\x80\x94for, after all is said\r\n      and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is the truth.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is now within a few days of three years since what I am going\r\n      to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18\xe2\x80\x94, a day\r\n      which the people of this part of the world will never forget\xe2\x80\x94for\r\n      it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever\r\n      came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed\r\n      until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze\r\n      from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the\r\n      oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to\r\n      follow.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe three of us\xe2\x80\x94my two brothers and myself\xe2\x80\x94had crossed over to\r\n      the islands about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded\r\n      the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more\r\n      plenty that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven,\r\n      _by my watch_, when we weighed and started for home, so as to\r\n      make the worst of the Str\xc3\xb6m at slack water, which we knew would\r\n      be at eight.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWe set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for\r\n      some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of\r\n      danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend\r\n      it. All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over\r\n      Helseggen. This was most unusual\xe2\x80\x94something that had never\r\n      happened to us before\xe2\x80\x94and I began to feel a little uneasy,\r\n      without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but\r\n      could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the\r\n      point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking\r\n      astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular\r\n      copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and\r\n      we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This\r\n      state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us\r\n      time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was upon\r\n      us\xe2\x80\x94in less than two the sky was entirely overcast\xe2\x80\x94and what with\r\n      this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we\r\n      could not see each other in the smack.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.\r\n      The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it.\r\n      We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us;\r\n      but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board as if\r\n      they had been sawed off\xe2\x80\x94the mainmast taking with it my youngest\r\n      brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOur boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon\r\n      water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near\r\n      the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten\r\n      down when about to cross the Str\xc3\xb6m, by way of precaution against\r\n      the chopping seas. But for this circumstance we should have\r\n      foundered at once\xe2\x80\x94for we lay entirely buried for some moments.\r\n      How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I\r\n      never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon as\r\n      I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my\r\n      feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands\r\n      grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere\r\n      instinct that prompted me to do this\xe2\x80\x94which was undoubtedly the\r\n      very best thing I could have done\xe2\x80\x94for I was too much flurried to\r\n      think.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all\r\n      this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could\r\n      stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping\r\n      hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our\r\n      little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming\r\n      out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the\r\n      seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had\r\n      come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to\r\n      be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder\r\n      brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he\r\n      was overboard\xe2\x80\x94but the next moment all this joy was turned into\r\n      horror\xe2\x80\x94for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the\r\n      word \xe2\x80\x98_Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m!_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I\r\n      shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of\r\n      the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well enough\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      knew what he wished to make me understand. With the wind that now\r\n      drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Str\xc3\xb6m, and\r\n      nothing could save us!\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou perceive that in crossing the Str\xc3\xb6m _channel_, we always\r\n      went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather,\r\n      and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack\xe2\x80\x94but now we\r\n      were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane\r\n      as this! \xe2\x80\x98To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, \xe2\x80\x98we shall get there just about\r\n      the slack\xe2\x80\x94there is some little hope in that\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but in the next\r\n      moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of\r\n      hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been\r\n      ten times a ninety-gun ship.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBy this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or\r\n      perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but\r\n      at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the\r\n      wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute\r\n      mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens.\r\n      Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but\r\n      nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of\r\n      clear sky\xe2\x80\x94as clear as I ever saw\xe2\x80\x94and of a deep bright blue\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I\r\n      never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us\r\n      with the greatest distinctness\xe2\x80\x94but, oh God, what a scene it was\r\n      to light up!\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother\xe2\x80\x94but, in\r\n      some manner which I could not understand, the din had so\r\n      increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although\r\n      I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook\r\n      his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his\r\n      fingers, as if to say _\xe2\x80\x98listen! \xe2\x80\x98_\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAt first I could not make out what he meant\xe2\x80\x94but soon a hideous\r\n      thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was\r\n      not going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst\r\n      into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run\r\n      down at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and\r\n      the whirl of the Str\xc3\xb6m was in full fury!_\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden,\r\n      the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always\r\n      to slip from beneath her\xe2\x80\x94which appears very strange to a\r\n      landsman\xe2\x80\x94and this is what is called _riding_, in sea phrase.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWell, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but\r\n      presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the\r\n      counter, and bore us with it as it rose\xe2\x80\x94up\xe2\x80\x94up\xe2\x80\x94as if into the sky.\r\n      I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And\r\n      then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made\r\n      me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty\r\n      mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a\r\n      quick glance around\xe2\x80\x94and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw\r\n      our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Str\xc3\xb6m whirlpool was\r\n      about a quarter of a mile dead ahead\xe2\x80\x94but no more like the\r\n      every-day Moskoe-Str\xc3\xb6m than the whirl as you now see it, is like\r\n      a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to\r\n      expect, I should not have recognised the place at all. As it was,\r\n      I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched\r\n      themselves together as if in a spasm.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we\r\n      suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The\r\n      boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its\r\n      new direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring\r\n      noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill\r\n      shriek\xe2\x80\x94such a sound as you might imagine given out by the\r\n      waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their\r\n      steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that always\r\n      surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another\r\n      moment would plunge us into the abyss, down which we could only\r\n      see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we\r\n      wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at\r\n      all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the\r\n      surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard\r\n      arose the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge\r\n      writhing wall between us and the horizon.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of\r\n      the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching\r\n      it. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great\r\n      deal of that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was\r\n      despair that strung my nerves.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt may look like boasting\xe2\x80\x94but what I tell you is truth\xe2\x80\x94I began\r\n      to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a\r\n      manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a\r\n      consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful\r\n      a manifestation of God\xe2\x80\x99s power. I do believe that I blushed with\r\n      shame when this idea crossed my mind. After a little while I\r\n      became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl\r\n      itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, even at\r\n      the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was\r\n      that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore\r\n      about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular\r\n      fancies to occupy a man\xe2\x80\x99s mind in such extremity\xe2\x80\x94and I have often\r\n      thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool\r\n      might have rendered me a little light-headed.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere was another circumstance which tended to restore my\r\n      self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which\r\n      could not reach us in our present situation\xe2\x80\x94for, as you saw\r\n      yourself, the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general\r\n      bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high,\r\n      black, mountainous ridge. If you have never been at sea in a\r\n      heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind\r\n      occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen,\r\n      and strangle you, and take away all power of action or\r\n      reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these\r\n      annoyances\xe2\x80\x94just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed\r\n      petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet\r\n      uncertain.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to\r\n      say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying\r\n      rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the\r\n      middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible\r\n      inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt. My\r\n      brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask\r\n      which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and\r\n      was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when\r\n      the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the pit he\r\n      let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in\r\n      the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it\r\n      was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never\r\n      felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act\xe2\x80\x94although I\r\n      knew he was a madman when he did it\xe2\x80\x94a raving maniac through sheer\r\n      fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point with him. I\r\n      knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at\r\n      all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask.\r\n      This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew\r\n      round steadily enough, and upon an even keel\xe2\x80\x94only swaying to and\r\n      fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely\r\n      had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild\r\n      lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I\r\n      muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAs I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had\r\n      instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my\r\n      eyes. For some seconds I dared not open them\xe2\x80\x94while I expected\r\n      instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my\r\n      death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment elapsed.\r\n      I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion of\r\n      the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt\r\n      of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along. I took\r\n      courage, and looked once again upon the scene.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNever shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and\r\n      admiration with which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be\r\n      hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface\r\n      of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose\r\n      perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but\r\n      for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for\r\n      the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of\r\n      the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I\r\n      have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along\r\n      the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of\r\n      the abyss.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAt first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.\r\n      The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld.\r\n      When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell\r\n      instinctively downward. In this direction I was able to obtain an\r\n      unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on the\r\n      inclined surface of the pool. She was quite upon an even\r\n      keel\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that\r\n      of the water\xe2\x80\x94but this latter sloped at an angle of more than\r\n      forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our\r\n      beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had\r\n      scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in\r\n      this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this,\r\n      I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the\r\n      profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on\r\n      account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped,\r\n      and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow\r\n      and tottering bridge which Mussulmen say is the only pathway\r\n      between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray, was no doubt\r\n      occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as\r\n      they all met together at the bottom\xe2\x80\x94but the yell that went up to\r\n      the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to\r\n      describe.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cOur first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam\r\n      above, had carried us a great distance down the slope; but our\r\n      farther descent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we\r\n      swept\xe2\x80\x94not with any uniform movement\xe2\x80\x94but in dizzying swings and\r\n      jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\r\n      nearly the complete circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward,\r\n      at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLooking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we\r\n      were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only\r\n      object in the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were\r\n      visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and\r\n      trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of\r\n      house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves. I have already\r\n      described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my\r\n      original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer\r\n      and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to watch, with a\r\n      strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our\r\n      company. I _must_ have been delirious, for I even sought\r\n      _amusement_ in speculating upon the relative velocities of their\r\n      several descents toward the foam below. \xe2\x80\x98This fir tree,\xe2\x80\x99 I found\r\n      myself at one time saying, \xe2\x80\x98will certainly be the next thing that\r\n      takes the awful plunge and disappears,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and then I was\r\n      disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship\r\n      overtook it and went down before. At length, after making several\r\n      guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all\xe2\x80\x94this fact\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of\r\n      reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat\r\n      heavily once more.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a\r\n      more exciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and\r\n      partly from present observation. I called to mind the great\r\n      variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden,\r\n      having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m.\r\n      By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the\r\n      most extraordinary way\xe2\x80\x94so chafed and roughened as to have the\r\n      appearance of being stuck full of splinters\xe2\x80\x94but then I distinctly\r\n      recollected that there were _some_ of them which were not\r\n      disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference\r\n      except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only\r\n      ones which had been _completely absorbed_\xe2\x80\x94that the others had\r\n      entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some\r\n      reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not\r\n      reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the\r\n      ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in either\r\n      instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level\r\n      of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been\r\n      drawn in more early, or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also,\r\n      three important observations. The first was, that, as a general\r\n      rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their\r\n      descent\xe2\x80\x94the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the\r\n      one spherical, and the other _of any other shape_, the\r\n      superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere\xe2\x80\x94the third,\r\n      that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and\r\n      the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more\r\n      slowly. Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this\r\n      subject with an old school-master of the district; and it was\r\n      from him that I learned the use of the words \xe2\x80\x98cylinder\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98sphere.\xe2\x80\x99 He explained to me\xe2\x80\x94although I have forgotten the\r\n      explanation\xe2\x80\x94how what I observed was, in fact, the natural\r\n      consequence of the forms of the floating fragments\xe2\x80\x94and showed me\r\n      how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered\r\n      more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater\r\n      difficulty than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere was one startling circumstance which went a great way in\r\n      enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn\r\n      them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we\r\n      passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a\r\n      vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level\r\n      when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool,\r\n      were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little\r\n      from their original station.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself\r\n      securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose\r\n      from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I\r\n      attracted my brother\xe2\x80\x99s attention by signs, pointed to the\r\n      floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my\r\n      power to make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at\r\n      length that he comprehended my design\xe2\x80\x94but, whether this was the\r\n      case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move\r\n      from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach\r\n      him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter\r\n      struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask\r\n      by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and\r\n      precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another\r\n      moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is\r\n      myself who now tell you this tale\xe2\x80\x94as you see that I _did_\r\n      escape\xe2\x80\x94and as you are already in possession of the mode in which\r\n      this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that\r\n      I have farther to say\xe2\x80\x94I will bring my story quickly to\r\n      conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my\r\n      quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance\r\n      beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid\r\n      succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged\r\n      headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The\r\n      barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half\r\n      the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which\r\n      I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the\r\n      character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast\r\n      funnel became momently less and less steep. The gyrations of the\r\n      whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By degrees, the\r\n      froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf\r\n      seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone\r\n      down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I\r\n      found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the\r\n      shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the\r\n      Moskoe-str\xc3\xb6m _had been_. It was the hour of the slack\xe2\x80\x94but the sea\r\n      still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the\r\n      hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Str\xc3\xb6m,\r\n      and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98grounds\xe2\x80\x99 of the fishermen. A boat picked me up\xe2\x80\x94exhausted from\r\n      fatigue\xe2\x80\x94and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the\r\n      memory of its horror. Those who drew me on board were my old\r\n      mates and daily companions\xe2\x80\x94but they knew me no more than they\r\n      would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair which\r\n      had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see it\r\n      now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had\r\n      changed. I told them my story\xe2\x80\x94they did not believe it. I now tell\r\n      it to _you_\xe2\x80\x94and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it\r\n      than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\n      After the very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say\r\n      nothing of the summary in \xe2\x80\x98Silliman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal,\xe2\x80\x99 with the detailed\r\n      statement just published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be\r\n      supposed, of course, that in offering a few hurried remarks in\r\n      reference to Von Kempelen\xe2\x80\x99s discovery, I have any design to look\r\n      at the subject in a scientific point of view. My object is\r\n      simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen\r\n      himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight\r\n      personal acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must\r\n      necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in the second\r\n      place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the\r\n      results of the discovery.\r\n\r\n      It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations\r\n      which I have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to\r\n      be a general impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this\r\n      kind, from the newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding\r\n      as it unquestionably is, is unanticipated.\r\n\r\n      By reference to the \xe2\x80\x98Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy\xe2\x80\x99 (Cottle and\r\n      Munroe, London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that\r\n      this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in\r\n      question, but had actually made no inconsiderable progress,\r\n      experimentally, in the very identical analysis now so\r\n      triumphantly brought to an issue by Von Kempelen, who although he\r\n      makes not the slightest allusion to it, is, without doubt (I say\r\n      it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required), indebted to\r\n      the \xe2\x80\x98Diary\xe2\x80\x99 for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.\r\n\r\n      The paragraph from the \xe2\x80\x98Courier and Enquirer,\xe2\x80\x99 which is now going\r\n      the rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the\r\n      invention for a Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I\r\n      confess, a little apocryphal, for several reasons; although there\r\n      is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement\r\n      made. I need not go into details. My opinion of the paragraph is\r\n      founded principally upon its manner. It does not look true.\r\n      Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom so particular as Mr.\r\n      Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise location.\r\n      Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he\r\n      says he did, at the period designated\xe2\x80\x94nearly eight years ago\xe2\x80\x94how\r\n      happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the\r\n      immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would\r\n      have resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large,\r\n      from the discovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man\r\n      of common understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam\r\n      says he did, and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby\xe2\x80\x94so\r\n      like an owl\xe2\x80\x94as Mr. Kissam admits that he did. By-the-way, who is\r\n      Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole paragraph in the \xe2\x80\x98Courier and\r\n      Enquirer\xe2\x80\x99 a fabrication got up to \xe2\x80\x98make a talk\xe2\x80\x99? It must be\r\n      confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air. Very little\r\n      dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if\r\n      I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of\r\n      science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of\r\n      inquiry, I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent\r\n      a chemist as Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam\xe2\x80\x99s (or is it\r\n      Mr. Quizzem\xe2\x80\x99s?) pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a\r\n      tone.\r\n\r\n      But to return to the \xe2\x80\x98Diary\xe2\x80\x99 of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet\r\n      was not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the\r\n      writer, as any person at all conversant with authorship may\r\n      satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style.\r\n      At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference\r\n      to his researches about the protoxide of azote: \xe2\x80\x98In less than\r\n      half a minute the respiration being continued, diminished\r\n      gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on\r\n      all the muscles.\xe2\x80\x99 That the respiration was not \xe2\x80\x98diminished,\xe2\x80\x99 is\r\n      not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the\r\n      plural, \xe2\x80\x98were.\xe2\x80\x99 The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: \xe2\x80\x98In\r\n      less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these\r\n      feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a\r\n      sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.\xe2\x80\x99 A\r\n      hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. so\r\n      inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant\r\n      only for the writer\xe2\x80\x99s own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet\r\n      will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my\r\n      suggestion. The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man\r\n      in the world to commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had\r\n      he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly\r\n      afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might\r\n      have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter\r\n      now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he had\r\n      every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily\r\n      believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched,\r\n      could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Diary\xe2\x80\x99 (full of crude speculations) would have been unattended\r\n      to; as, it seems, they were. I say \xe2\x80\x98his wishes,\xe2\x80\x99 for that he\r\n      meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers\r\n      directed \xe2\x80\x98to be burnt,\xe2\x80\x99 I think there can be no manner of doubt.\r\n      Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet\r\n      remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the\r\n      other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do\r\n      not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet\r\n      remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself\r\n      (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or\r\n      disservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his\r\n      immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to\r\n      doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98realize,\xe2\x80\x99 in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with\r\n      other property of intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n      In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the \xe2\x80\x98Home\r\n      Journal,\xe2\x80\x99 and has since been extensively copied, several\r\n      misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by\r\n      the translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a\r\n      late number of the Presburg \xe2\x80\x98Schnellpost.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Viele\xe2\x80\x99 has evidently\r\n      been misconceived (as it often is), and what the translator\r\n      renders by \xe2\x80\x98sorrows,\xe2\x80\x99 is probably \xe2\x80\x98lieden,\xe2\x80\x99 which, in its true\r\n      version, \xe2\x80\x98sufferings,\xe2\x80\x99 would give a totally different complexion\r\n      to the whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely\r\n      guess, on my part.\r\n\r\n      Von Kempelen, however, is by no means \xe2\x80\x98a misanthrope,\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\n      appearance, at least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance\r\n      with him was casual altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in\r\n      saying that I know him at all; but to have seen and conversed\r\n      with a man of so _prodigious_ a notoriety as he has attained, or\r\n      _will_ attain in a few days, is not a small matter, as times go.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Literary World\xe2\x80\x9d speaks of him, confidently, as a native of\r\n      Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Home Journal\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n      but I am pleased in being able to state _positively_, since I\r\n      have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the\r\n      State of New York, although both his parents, I believe, are of\r\n      Presburg descent. The family is connected, in some way, with\r\n      M\xc3\xa4elzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he is short\r\n      and stout, with large, _fat_, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers,\r\n      a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose.\r\n      There is some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank,\r\n      and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he\r\n      looks, speaks, and acts as little like \xe2\x80\x98a misanthrope\xe2\x80\x99 as any man\r\n      I ever saw. We were fellow-sojourners for a week about six years\r\n      ago, at Earl\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume\r\n      that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or\r\n      four hours altogether. His principal topics were those of the\r\n      day; and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his\r\n      scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me, intending to\r\n      go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city\r\n      that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it\r\n      was there that he was first suspected of having made it. This is\r\n      about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von\r\n      Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would\r\n      have interest for the public.\r\n\r\n      There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors\r\n      afloat about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about\r\n      as much credit as the story of Aladdin\xe2\x80\x99s lamp; and yet, in a case\r\n      of this kind, as in the case of the discoveries in California, it\r\n      is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction. The\r\n      following anecdote, at least, is so well authenticated, that we\r\n      may receive it implicitly.\r\n\r\n      Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his\r\n      residence at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been\r\n      put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the\r\n      great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of\r\n      Gutsmuth & Co., suspicion was directed toward Von Kempelen, on\r\n      account of his having purchased a considerable property in\r\n      Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain\r\n      how he became possessed of the purchase money. He was at length\r\n      arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the\r\n      end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch upon\r\n      his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently,\r\n      taking always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers\r\n      the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and\r\n      crooked passages known by the flash name of the \xe2\x80\x98Dondergat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a\r\n      garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called\r\n      Flatzplatz,\xe2\x80\x94and, coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they\r\n      imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting operations. His\r\n      agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had\r\n      not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffing him,\r\n      they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he\r\n      occupied all the mansarde.\r\n\r\n      Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten\r\n      feet by eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which\r\n      the object has not yet been ascertained. In one corner of the\r\n      closet was a very small furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and\r\n      on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible\xe2\x80\x94two crucibles connected\r\n      by a tube. One of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a\r\n      state of fusion, but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube,\r\n      which was close to the brim. The other crucible had some liquid\r\n      in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously\r\n      dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself taken,\r\n      Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased\r\n      in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw\r\n      the contents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed\r\n      him; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched\r\n      his person, but nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a\r\n      paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing what was afterward\r\n      ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown\r\n      substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions. All\r\n      attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed,\r\n      but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted.\r\n\r\n      Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went\r\n      through a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was\r\n      found, to the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping-room. They here rummaged some\r\n      drawers and boxes, but discovered only a few papers, of no\r\n      importance, and some good coin, silver and gold. At length,\r\n      looking under the bed, they saw a large, common hair trunk,\r\n      without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying carelessly\r\n      across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk out\r\n      from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength\r\n      (there were three of them, all powerful men), they \xe2\x80\x98could not\r\n      stir it one inch.\xe2\x80\x99 Much astonished at this, one of them crawled\r\n      under the bed, and looking into the trunk, said:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98No wonder we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move it\xe2\x80\x94why it\xe2\x80\x99s full to the brim of old\r\n      bits of brass!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good\r\n      purchase, and pushing with all his force, while his companions\r\n      pulled with all theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid\r\n      out from under the bed, and its contents examined. The supposed\r\n      brass with which it was filled was all in small, smooth pieces,\r\n      varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar; but the\r\n      pieces were irregular in shape, although more or less\r\n      flat-looking, upon the whole, \xe2\x80\x9cvery much as lead looks when\r\n      thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to\r\n      grow cool.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected\r\n      this metal to be anything _but_ brass. The idea of its being\r\n      _gold_ never entered their brains, of course; how _could_ such a\r\n      wild fancy have entered it? And their astonishment may be well\r\n      conceived, when the next day it became known, all over Bremen,\r\n      that the \xe2\x80\x9clot of brass\xe2\x80\x9d which they had carted so contemptuously\r\n      to the police office, without putting themselves to the trouble\r\n      of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only gold\xe2\x80\x94real gold\xe2\x80\x94but\r\n      gold far finer than any employed in coinage\xe2\x80\x94gold, in fact,\r\n      absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy.\r\n\r\n      I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen\xe2\x80\x99s confession (as\r\n      far as it went) and release, for these are familiar to the\r\n      public. That he has actually realized, in spirit and in effect,\r\n      if not to the letter, the old chimaera of the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      stone, no sane person is at liberty to doubt. The opinions of\r\n      Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest consideration; but\r\n      he is by no means infallible; and what he says of bismuth, in his\r\n      report to the Academy, must be taken _cum grano salis_. The\r\n      simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed;\r\n      and until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own\r\n      published enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will\r\n      remain, for years, in statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be\r\n      said to be known is, that \xe2\x80\x98Pure gold can be made at will, and\r\n      very readily from lead in connection with certain other\r\n      substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n      Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate\r\n      results of this discovery\xe2\x80\x94a discovery which few thinking persons\r\n      will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter\r\n      of gold generally, by the late developments in California; and\r\n      this reflection brings us inevitably to another\xe2\x80\x94the exceeding\r\n      inopportuneness of Von Kempelen\xe2\x80\x99s analysis. If many were\r\n      prevented from adventuring to California, by the mere\r\n      apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value, on\r\n      account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render the\r\n      speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one\xe2\x80\x94what\r\n      impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to\r\n      emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the\r\n      mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery\r\n      of Von Kempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words,\r\n      that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes\r\n      (whatever that worth may be), gold now is, or at least soon will\r\n      be (for it cannot be supposed that Von Kempelen can long retain\r\n      his secret), of no greater value than lead, and of far inferior\r\n      value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to\r\n      speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery,\r\n      but one thing may be positively maintained\xe2\x80\x94that the announcement\r\n      of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence\r\n      in regard to the settlement of California.\r\n\r\n      In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise\r\n      of two hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly\r\n      twenty-five per cent. that of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESMERIC REVELATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever doubt may still envelop the _rationale_ of mesmerism, its\r\nstartling _facts_ are now almost universally admitted. Of these latter,\r\nthose who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession\xe2\x80\x94an unprofitable\r\nand disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste of time\r\nthan the attempt to _prove_, at the present day, that man, by mere\r\nexercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an\r\nabnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those\r\nof _death_, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the\r\nphenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,\r\nwhile in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,\r\nand then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with\r\nkeenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,\r\nmatters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his\r\nintellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that\r\nhis sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and,\r\nfinally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its\r\nfrequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena\r\nelicited are more extended and more _pronounced_.\r\n\r\nI say that these\xe2\x80\x94which are the laws of mesmerism in its general\r\nfeatures\xe2\x80\x94it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict\r\nupon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose at\r\npresent is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in the\r\nteeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very\r\nremarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr.\r\nVankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the\r\nmesmeric perception had supervened. For many months he had been\r\nlaboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects of\r\nwhich had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of\r\nWednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.\r\n\r\nThe invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart,\r\nand breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of\r\nasthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the\r\napplication of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night this had\r\nbeen attempted in vain.\r\n\r\nAs I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although\r\nevidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent for you to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot so much to administer to my\r\nbodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions\r\nwhich, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. I need\r\nnot tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the topic of the\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x99s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if\r\nin that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of\r\nits own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to\r\nconviction. With it my reason had nothing to do. All attempts at\r\nlogical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than\r\nbefore. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own\r\nworks as well as in those of his European and American echoes. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charles Elwood\xe2\x80\x99 of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed in my hands.\r\nI read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it logical, but\r\nthe portions which were not _merely_ logical were unhappily the initial\r\narguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it\r\nseemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in\r\nconvincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like\r\nthe government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in perceiving that\r\nif man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he\r\nwill never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so\r\nlong the fashion of the moralists of England, of France, and of\r\nGermany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no hold on the\r\nmind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will\r\nalways in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will\r\nmay assent\xe2\x80\x94the soul\xe2\x80\x94the intellect, never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually\r\nbelieved. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the\r\nfeeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of\r\nreason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am\r\nenabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence. I\r\ncannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the\r\nmesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination\r\nwhich, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full\r\naccordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through\r\nits _effect_, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning\r\nand its conclusion\xe2\x80\x94the cause and its effect\xe2\x80\x94are present together. In my\r\nnatural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only\r\npartially, remains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese considerations have led me to think that some good results might\r\nensue from a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while\r\nmesmerized. You have often observed the profound self-cognizance\r\nevinced by the sleep-waker\xe2\x80\x94the extensive knowledge he displays upon all\r\npoints relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and from this\r\nself-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a\r\ncatechism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes threw Mr.\r\nVankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became immediately more\r\neasy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness. The following\r\nconversation then ensued:\xe2\x80\x94V. in the dialogue representing the patient,\r\nand P. myself.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Are you asleep?\r\n\r\n      _V._ Yes\xe2\x80\x94no; I would rather sleep more soundly.\r\n\r\n      _P._ [_After a few more passes._] Do you sleep now?\r\n\r\n      _V._ Yes.\r\n\r\n      _P._ How do you think your present illness will result?\r\n\r\n      _V._ [_After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort_.]\r\n      I must die.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Does the idea of death afflict you?\r\n\r\n      _V._ [_Very quickly_.] No\xe2\x80\x94no!\r\n\r\n      _P._ Are you pleased with the prospect?\r\n\r\n      _V._ If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no\r\n      matter. The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.\r\n\r\n      _P._ I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.\r\n\r\n      _V._ I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I\r\n      feel able to make. You do not question me properly.\r\n\r\n      _P._ What then shall I ask?\r\n\r\n      _V._ You must begin at the beginning.\r\n\r\n      _P._ The beginning! But where is the beginning?\r\n\r\n      _V._ You know that the beginning is GOD. [_This was said in a\r\n      low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound\r\n      veneration_.]\r\n\r\n      _P._ What then, is God?\r\n\r\n      _V._ [_Hesitating for many minutes._] I cannot tell.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Is not God spirit?\r\n\r\n      _V._ While I was awake I knew what you meant by \xe2\x80\x9cspirit,\xe2\x80\x9d but now\r\n      it seems only a word\xe2\x80\x94such, for instance, as truth, beauty\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n      quality, I mean.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Is not God immaterial?\r\n\r\n      _V._ There is no immateriality\xe2\x80\x94it is a mere word. That which is\r\n      not matter, is not at all\xe2\x80\x94unless qualities are things.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Is God, then, material?\r\n\r\n      _V._ No. [_This reply startled me very much._]\r\n\r\n      _P._ What, then, is he?\r\n\r\n      _V._ [_After a long pause, and mutteringly._] I see\xe2\x80\x94but it is a\r\n      thing difficult to tell. [_Another long pause._] He is not\r\n      spirit, for he exists. Nor is he matter, as _you understand it_.\r\n      But there are _gradations_ of matter of which man knows nothing;\r\n      the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser.\r\n      The atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while\r\n      the electric principle permeates the atmosphere. These gradations\r\n      of matter increase in rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a\r\n      matter _unparticled_\xe2\x80\x94without particles\xe2\x80\x94indivisible\xe2\x80\x94_one;_ and\r\n      here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified. The\r\n      ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only permeates all things\r\n      but impels all things; and thus _is_ all things within itself.\r\n      This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in the word\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cthought,\xe2\x80\x9d is this matter in motion.\r\n\r\n      _P._ The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to\r\n      motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the\r\n      former.\r\n\r\n      _V._ Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the\r\n      action of _mind_, not of _thinking_. The unparticled matter, or\r\n      God, in quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men\r\n      call mind. And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect\r\n      to human volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of\r\n      its unity and omniprevalence; _how_ I know not, and now clearly\r\n      see that I shall never know. But the unparticled matter, set in\r\n      motion by a law, or quality, existing within itself, is thinking.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the\r\n      unparticled matter?\r\n\r\n      _V._ The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in\r\n      gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop\r\n      of water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the\r\n      luminiferous ether. Now we call all these things matter, and\r\n      embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of\r\n      this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than\r\n      that which we attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the\r\n      luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we feel an almost\r\n      irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with\r\n      nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our\r\n      conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to\r\n      seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in\r\n      infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the\r\n      idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able\r\n      to regard the ether as an entity, or at least as matter. For want\r\n      of a better word we might term it spirit. Take, now, a step\r\n      beyond the luminiferous ether\xe2\x80\x94conceive a matter as much more rare\r\n      than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we\r\n      arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique\r\n      mass\xe2\x80\x94an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite\r\n      littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness\r\n      in the spaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a\r\n      point\xe2\x80\x94there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms\r\n      are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the\r\n      mass absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of the atomic\r\n      constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass\r\n      inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear,\r\n      however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it\r\n      is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to\r\n      imagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have\r\n      formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding\r\n      by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.\r\n\r\n      _P._ There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of\r\n      absolute coalescence;\xe2\x80\x94and that is the very slight resistance\r\n      experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through\r\n      space\xe2\x80\x94a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in\r\n      _some_ degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have\r\n      been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton. We know\r\n      that the resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their\r\n      density. Absolute coalescence is absolute density. Where there\r\n      are no interspaces, there can be no yielding. An ether,\r\n      absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to\r\n      the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.\r\n\r\n      _V._ Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in\r\n      the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.\xe2\x80\x94As regards the\r\n      progress of the star, it can make no difference whether the star\r\n      passes through the ether _or the ether through it_. There is no\r\n      astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles\r\n      the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their\r\n      passage through an ether: for, however rare this ether be\r\n      supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a\r\n      very far briefer period than has been admitted by those\r\n      astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they\r\n      found it impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually\r\n      experienced is, on the other hand, about that which might be\r\n      expected from the _friction_ of the ether in the instantaneous\r\n      passage through the orb. In the one case, the retarding force is\r\n      momentary and complete within itself\xe2\x80\x94in the other it is endlessly\r\n      accumulative.\r\n\r\n      _P._ But in all this\xe2\x80\x94in this identification of mere matter with\r\n      God\xe2\x80\x94is there nothing of irreverence? [_I was forced to repeat\r\n      this question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my\r\n      meaning_.]\r\n\r\n      _V._ Can you say _why_ matter should be less reverenced than\r\n      mind? But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all\r\n      respects, the very \xe2\x80\x9cmind\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cspirit\xe2\x80\x9d of the schools, so far as\r\n      regards its high capacities, and is, moreover, the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\n      these schools at the same time. God, with all the powers\r\n      attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of matter.\r\n\r\n      _P._ You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is\r\n      thought?\r\n\r\n      _V._ In general, this motion is the universal thought of the\r\n      universal mind. This thought creates. All created things are but\r\n      the thoughts of God.\r\n\r\n      _P._ You say, \xe2\x80\x9cin general.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      _V._ Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities,\r\n      _matter_ is necessary.\r\n\r\n      _P._ But you now speak of \xe2\x80\x9cmind\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d as do the\r\n      metaphysicians.\r\n\r\n      _V._ Yes\xe2\x80\x94to avoid confusion. When I say \xe2\x80\x9cmind,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the\r\n      unparticled or ultimate matter; by \xe2\x80\x9cmatter,\xe2\x80\x9d I intend all else.\r\n\r\n      _P._ You were saying that \xe2\x80\x9cfor new individualities matter is\r\n      necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      _V._ Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To\r\n      create individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate\r\n      portions of the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested\r\n      of corporate investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion\r\n      of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the\r\n      thought of man; as the motion of the whole is that of God.\r\n\r\n      _P._ You say that divested of the body man will be God?\r\n\r\n      _V._ [_After much hesitation._] I could not have said this; it is\r\n      an absurdity.\r\n\r\n      _P._ [_Referring to my notes._] You _did_ say that \xe2\x80\x9cdivested of\r\n      corporate investiture man were God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      _V._ And this is true. Man thus divested _would be_ God\xe2\x80\x94would be\r\n      unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested\xe2\x80\x94at least\r\n      never _will be_\xe2\x80\x94else we must imagine an action of God returning\r\n      upon itself\xe2\x80\x94a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature.\r\n      Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be\r\n      irrevocable.\r\n\r\n      _P._ I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the\r\n      body?\r\n\r\n      _V._ I say that he will never be bodiless.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Explain.\r\n\r\n      _V._ There are two bodies\xe2\x80\x94the rudimental and the complete;\r\n      corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the\r\n      butterfly. What we call \xe2\x80\x9cdeath,\xe2\x80\x9d is but the painful\r\n      metamorphosis. Our present incarnation is progressive,\r\n      preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate,\r\n      immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.\r\n\r\n      _P._ But of the worm\xe2\x80\x99s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.\r\n\r\n      _V._ _We_, certainly\xe2\x80\x94but not the worm. The matter of which our\r\n      rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of\r\n      that body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted\r\n      to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to\r\n      that of which the ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus\r\n      escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell\r\n      which falls, in decaying, from the inner form; not that inner\r\n      form itself; but this inner form, as well as the shell, is\r\n      appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life.\r\n\r\n      _P._ You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly\r\n      resembles death. How is this?\r\n\r\n      _V._ When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles\r\n      the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my\r\n      rudimental life are in abeyance, and I perceive external things\r\n      directly, without organs, through a medium which I shall employ\r\n      in the ultimate, unorganized life.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Unorganized?\r\n\r\n      _V._ Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is\r\n      brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms\r\n      of matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms. The\r\n      organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition, and to\r\n      that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of\r\n      unlimited comprehension in all points but one\xe2\x80\x94the nature of the\r\n      volition of God\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the motion of the unparticled\r\n      matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by\r\n      conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is _not_; but a\r\n      conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of\r\n      what it _is_. A luminous body imparts vibration to the\r\n      luminiferous ether. The vibrations generate similar ones within\r\n      the retina; these again communicate similar ones to the optic\r\n      nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain,\r\n      also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.\r\n      The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the\r\n      first undulation. This is the mode by which the mind of the\r\n      rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this\r\n      external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the\r\n      idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized\r\n      life, the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a\r\n      substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no\r\n      other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than\r\n      even the luminiferous; and to this ether\xe2\x80\x94in unison with it\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      whole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter\r\n      which permeates it. It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs,\r\n      therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception\r\n      of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs are the cages\r\n      necessary to confine them until fledged.\r\n\r\n      _P._ You speak of rudimental \xe2\x80\x9cbeings.\xe2\x80\x9d Are there other rudimental\r\n      thinking beings than man?\r\n\r\n      _V._ The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebul\xc3\xa6,\r\n      planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebul\xc3\xa6, suns,\r\n      nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying _pabulum_ for\r\n      the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental\r\n      beings. But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the\r\n      ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these.\r\n      Each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic,\r\n      rudimental, thinking creatures. In all, the organs vary with the\r\n      features of the place tenanted. At death, or metamorphosis, these\r\n      creatures, enjoying the ultimate life\xe2\x80\x94immortality\xe2\x80\x94and cognizant\r\n      of all secrets but _the one_, act all things and pass everywhere\r\n      by mere volition:\xe2\x80\x94indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the\r\n      sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly\r\n      deem space created\xe2\x80\x94but that SPACE itself\xe2\x80\x94that infinity of which\r\n      the truly substantive vastness swallows up the\r\n      star-shadows\xe2\x80\x94blotting them out as non-entities from the\r\n      perception of the angels.\r\n\r\n      _P._ You say that \xe2\x80\x9cbut for the _necessity_ of the rudimental\r\n      life\xe2\x80\x9d there would have been no stars. But why this necessity?\r\n\r\n      _V._ In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter\r\n      generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple\r\n      _unique_ law\xe2\x80\x94the Divine Volition. With the view of producing\r\n      impediment, the organic life and matter, (complex, substantial,\r\n      and law-encumbered,) were contrived.\r\n\r\n      _P._ But again\xe2\x80\x94why need this impediment have been produced?\r\n\r\n      _V._ The result of law inviolate is perfection\xe2\x80\x94right\xe2\x80\x94negative\r\n      happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong,\r\n      positive pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number,\r\n      complexity, and substantiality of the laws of organic life and\r\n      matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a certain extent,\r\n      practicable. Thus pain, which in the inorganic life is\r\n      impossible, is possible in the organic.\r\n\r\n      _P._ But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?\r\n\r\n      _V._ All things are either good or bad by comparison. A\r\n      sufficient analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but\r\n      the contrast of pain. _Positive_ pleasure is a mere idea. To be\r\n      happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same. Never\r\n      to suffer would have been never to have been blessed. But it has\r\n      been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be thus the\r\n      necessity for the organic. The pain of the primitive life of\r\n      Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in\r\n      Heaven.\r\n\r\n      _P._ Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it\r\n      impossible to comprehend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe truly _substantive_ vastness of\r\n      infinity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      _V._ This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic\r\n      conception of the term \xe2\x80\x9c_substance_\xe2\x80\x9d itself. We must not regard\r\n      it as a quality, but as a sentiment:\xe2\x80\x94it is the perception, in\r\n      thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to their\r\n      organization. There are many things on the Earth, which would be\r\n      nihility to the inhabitants of Venus\xe2\x80\x94many things visible and\r\n      tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as\r\n      existing at all. But to the inorganic beings\xe2\x80\x94to the angels\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      whole of the unparticled matter is substance\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the\r\n      whole of what we term \xe2\x80\x9cspace\xe2\x80\x9d is to them the truest\r\n      substantiality;\xe2\x80\x94the stars, meantime, through what we consider\r\n      their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion\r\n      as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its\r\n      immateriality, eludes the organic.\r\n\r\n      As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble\r\n      tone, I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which\r\n      somewhat alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No\r\n      sooner had I done this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all\r\n      his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired. I noticed\r\n      that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern\r\n      rigidity of stone. His brow was of the coldness of ice. Thus,\r\n      ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long pressure\r\n      from Azrael\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the\r\n      latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the\r\n      region of the shadows?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR\r\n\r\n\r\n      Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for\r\n      wonder, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited\r\n      discussion. It would have been a miracle had it not\xe2\x80\x94especially\r\n      under the circumstances. Through the desire of all parties\r\n      concerned, to keep the affair from the public, at least for the\r\n      present, or until we had farther opportunities for\r\n      investigation\xe2\x80\x94through our endeavors to effect this\xe2\x80\x94a garbled or\r\n      exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the\r\n      source of many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very\r\n      naturally, of a great deal of disbelief.\r\n\r\n      It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts\xe2\x80\x94as far as I\r\n      comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:\r\n\r\n      My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn\r\n      to the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it\r\n      occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments\r\n      made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most\r\n      unaccountable omission:\xe2\x80\x94no person had as yet been mesmerized in\r\n      articulo mortis. It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such\r\n      condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the\r\n      magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was\r\n      impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent,\r\n      or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be\r\n      arrested by the process. There were other points to be\r\n      ascertained, but these most excited my curiosity\xe2\x80\x94the last in\r\n      especial, from the immensely important character of its\r\n      consequences.\r\n\r\n      In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test\r\n      these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest\r\n      Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the \xe2\x80\x9cBibliotheca Forensica,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the\r\n      Polish versions of \xe2\x80\x9cWallenstein\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGargantua.\xe2\x80\x9d M. Valdemar,\r\n      who has resided principally at Harlem, N.Y., since the year 1839,\r\n      is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of\r\n      his person\xe2\x80\x94his lower limbs much resembling those of John\r\n      Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in\r\n      violent contrast to the blackness of his hair\xe2\x80\x94the latter, in\r\n      consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His\r\n      temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject\r\n      for mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him\r\n      to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other\r\n      results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to\r\n      anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or thoroughly,\r\n      under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could\r\n      accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always\r\n      attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of\r\n      his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted\r\n      with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed\r\n      phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his\r\n      approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor\r\n      regretted.\r\n\r\n      When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it\r\n      was of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I\r\n      knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any\r\n      scruples from him; and he had no relatives in America who would\r\n      be likely to interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject;\r\n      and, to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited. I say\r\n      to my surprise, for, although he had always yielded his person\r\n      freely to my experiments, he had never before given me any tokens\r\n      of sympathy with what I did. His disease was of that character\r\n      which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of\r\n      its termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us\r\n      that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the\r\n      period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.\r\n\r\n      It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.\r\n      Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:\r\n\r\n      MY DEAR P\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\r\n\r\n      You may as well come now. D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 are agreed that I cannot\r\n      hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the\r\n      time very nearly.\r\n\r\n      VALDEMAR\r\n\r\n      I received this note within half an hour after it was written,\r\n      and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man\xe2\x80\x99s chamber. I\r\n      had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful\r\n      alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him. His face\r\n      wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the\r\n      emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through\r\n      by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive. The pulse\r\n      was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very\r\n      remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of\r\n      physical strength. He spoke with distinctness\xe2\x80\x94took some\r\n      palliative medicines without aid\xe2\x80\x94and, when I entered the room,\r\n      was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was\r\n      propped up in the bed by pillows. Doctors D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 were in\r\n      attendance.\r\n\r\n      After pressing Valdemar\xe2\x80\x99s hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and\r\n      obtained from them a minute account of the patient\xe2\x80\x99s condition.\r\n      The left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or\r\n      cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all\r\n      purposes of vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also\r\n      partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region\r\n      was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into\r\n      another. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one\r\n      point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These\r\n      appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date.\r\n      The ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no\r\n      sign of it had been discovered a month before, and the adhesion\r\n      had only been observed during the three previous days.\r\n      Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of\r\n      aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms\r\n      rendered an exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of\r\n      both physicians that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the\r\n      morrow (Sunday). It was then seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Saturday evening.\r\n\r\n      On quitting the invalid\xe2\x80\x99s bed-side to hold conversation with\r\n      myself, Doctors D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 had bidden him a final farewell. It\r\n      had not been their intention to return; but, at my request, they\r\n      agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.\r\n\r\n      When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the\r\n      subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more\r\n      particularly, of the experiment proposed. He still professed\r\n      himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made, and urged\r\n      me to commence it at once. A male and a female nurse were in\r\n      attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to\r\n      engage in a task of this character with no more reliable\r\n      witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might\r\n      prove. I therefore postponed operations until about eight the\r\n      next night, when the arrival of a medical student with whom I had\r\n      some acquaintance, (Mr. Theodore L\xe2\x80\x94l,) relieved me from farther\r\n      embarrassment. It had been my design, originally, to wait for the\r\n      physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the urgent\r\n      entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I\r\n      had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.\r\n\r\n      Mr. L\xe2\x80\x94l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take\r\n      notes of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that\r\n      what I now have to relate is, for the most part, either condensed\r\n      or copied verbatim.\r\n\r\n      It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr.\r\n      L\xe2\x80\x94l, whether he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should\r\n      make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.\r\n\r\n      He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I wish to be. I fear\r\n      you have mesmerized\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94adding immediately afterwards: \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you\r\n      have deferred it too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already\r\n      found most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced\r\n      with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but\r\n      although I exerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect\r\n      was induced until some minutes after ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when Doctors\r\n      D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 called, according to appointment. I explained to\r\n      them, in a few words, what I designed, and as they opposed no\r\n      objection, saying that the patient was already in the death\r\n      agony, I proceeded without hesitation\xe2\x80\x94exchanging, however, the\r\n      lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely\r\n      into the right eye of the sufferer.\r\n\r\n      By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was\r\n      stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.\r\n\r\n      This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At\r\n      the expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very\r\n      deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous\r\n      breathing ceased\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer\r\n      apparent; the intervals were undiminished. The patient\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      extremities were of an icy coldness.\r\n\r\n      At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of\r\n      the mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed\r\n      for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never\r\n      seen except in cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite\r\n      impossible to mistake. With a few rapid lateral passes I made the\r\n      lids quiver, as in incipient sleep, and with a few more I closed\r\n      them altogether. I was not satisfied, however, with this, but\r\n      continued the manipulations vigorously, and with the fullest\r\n      exertion of the will, until I had completely stiffened the limbs\r\n      of the slumberer, after placing them in a seemingly easy\r\n      position. The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so,\r\n      and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin. The\r\n      head was very slightly elevated.\r\n\r\n      When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I\r\n      requested the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      condition. After a few experiments, they admitted him to be an\r\n      unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both\r\n      the physicians was greatly excited. Dr. D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 resolved at once to\r\n      remain with the patient all night, while Dr. F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 took leave with\r\n      a promise to return at daybreak. Mr. L\xe2\x80\x94l and the nurses remained.\r\n\r\n      We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three\r\n      o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in\r\n      precisely the same condition as when Dr. F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 went away\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\n      say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible;\r\n      the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the\r\n      application of a mirror to the lips); the eyes were closed\r\n      naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.\r\n      Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of death.\r\n\r\n      As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to\r\n      influence his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the\r\n      latter gently to and fro above his person. In such experiments\r\n      with this patient, I had never perfectly succeeded before, and\r\n      assuredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my\r\n      astonishment, his arm very readily, although feebly, followed\r\n      every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to hazard a\r\n      few words of conversation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cM. Valdemar,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9care you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d He made no answer, but I\r\n      perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat\r\n      the question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole\r\n      frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids\r\n      unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the\r\n      ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a\r\n      barely audible whisper, issued the words:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes;\xe2\x80\x94asleep now. Do not wake me!\xe2\x80\x94let me die so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right\r\n      arm, as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the\r\n      sleep-waker again:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDo you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNo pain\xe2\x80\x94I am dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then,\r\n      and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\r\n      who came a little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded\r\n      astonishment at finding the patient still alive. After feeling\r\n      the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to\r\n      speak to the sleep-waker again. I did so, saying:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cM. Valdemar, do you still sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during\r\n      the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies\r\n      to speak. At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very\r\n      faintly, almost inaudibly:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes; still asleep\xe2\x80\x94dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians,\r\n      that M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his\r\n      present apparently tranquil condition, until death should\r\n      supervene\xe2\x80\x94and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place\r\n      within a few minutes. I concluded, however, to speak to him once\r\n      more, and merely repeated my previous question.\r\n\r\n      While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of\r\n      the sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the\r\n      pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a\r\n      cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper;\r\n      and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly\r\n      defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once. I use this\r\n      expression, because the suddenness of their departure put me in\r\n      mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a\r\n      puff of the breath. The upper lip, at the same time, writhed\r\n      itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered\r\n      completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk,\r\n      leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view\r\n      the swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the\r\n      party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors;\r\n      but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of M.\r\n      Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back\r\n      from the region of the bed.\r\n\r\n      I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which\r\n      every reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my\r\n      business, however, simply to proceed.\r\n\r\n      There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar;\r\n      and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the\r\n      charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was\r\n      observable in the tongue. This continued for perhaps a minute. At\r\n      the expiration of this period, there issued from the distended\r\n      and motionless jaws a voice\xe2\x80\x94such as it would be madness in me to\r\n      attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or three epithets\r\n      which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might\r\n      say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and\r\n      hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple\r\n      reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of\r\n      humanity. There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I\r\n      thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as\r\n      characteristic of the intonation\xe2\x80\x94as well adapted to convey some\r\n      idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the voice\r\n      seemed to reach our ears\xe2\x80\x94at least mine\xe2\x80\x94from a vast distance, or\r\n      from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place, it\r\n      impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make\r\n      myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress\r\n      the sense of touch.\r\n\r\n      I have spoken both of \xe2\x80\x9csound\xe2\x80\x9d and of \xe2\x80\x9cvoice.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean to say that\r\n      the sound was one of distinct\xe2\x80\x94of even wonderfully, thrillingly\r\n      distinct\xe2\x80\x94syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke\xe2\x80\x94obviously in reply to\r\n      the question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had\r\n      asked him, it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes;\xe2\x80\x94no;\xe2\x80\x94I have been sleeping\xe2\x80\x94and now\xe2\x80\x94now\xe2\x80\x94I am dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress,\r\n      the unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus\r\n      uttered, were so well calculated to convey. Mr. L\xe2\x80\x94l (the student)\r\n      swooned. The nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not\r\n      be induced to return. My own impressions I would not pretend to\r\n      render intelligible to the reader. For nearly an hour, we busied\r\n      ourselves, silently\xe2\x80\x94without the utterance of a word\xe2\x80\x94in endeavors\r\n      to revive Mr. L\xe2\x80\x94l. When he came to himself, we addressed\r\n      ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar\xe2\x80\x99s condition.\r\n\r\n      It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the\r\n      exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of\r\n      respiration. An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I\r\n      should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my\r\n      will. I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my\r\n      hand. The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric\r\n      influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue,\r\n      whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be\r\n      making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition.\r\n      To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed\r\n      utterly insensible\xe2\x80\x94although I endeavored to place each member of\r\n      the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have\r\n      now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the\r\n      sleep-waker\xe2\x80\x99s state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured;\r\n      and at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock I left the house in company with the two\r\n      physicians and Mr. L\xe2\x80\x94l.\r\n\r\n      In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His\r\n      condition remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion\r\n      as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had\r\n      little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be\r\n      served by so doing. It was evident that, so far, death (or what\r\n      is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric\r\n      process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar\r\n      would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy,\r\n      dissolution.\r\n\r\n      From this period until the close of last week\xe2\x80\x94an interval of\r\n      nearly seven months\xe2\x80\x94we continued to make daily calls at M.\r\n      Valdemar\xe2\x80\x99s house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other\r\n      friends. All this time the sleeper-waker remained _exactly_ as I\r\n      have last described him. The nurses\xe2\x80\x99 attentions were continual.\r\n\r\n      It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the\r\n      experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is\r\n      the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which\r\n      has given rise to so much discussion in private circles\xe2\x80\x94to so\r\n      much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.\r\n\r\n      For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric\r\n      trance, I made use of the customary passes. These, for a time,\r\n      were unsuccessful. The first indication of revival was afforded\r\n      by a partial descent of the iris. It was observed, as especially\r\n      remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by\r\n      the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from beneath the\r\n      lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.\r\n\r\n      It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the\r\n      patient\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr.\r\n      F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 then intimated a desire to have me put a question. I did so,\r\n      as follows:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cM. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or\r\n      wishes now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks;\r\n      the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth\r\n      (although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before), and at\r\n      length the same hideous voice which I have already described,\r\n      broke forth:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x94put me to sleep\xe2\x80\x94or, quick!\xe2\x80\x94waken\r\n      me!\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x94I say to you that I am dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided\r\n      what to do. At first I made an endeavor to recompose the patient;\r\n      but, failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I\r\n      retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him. In\r\n      this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful\xe2\x80\x94or at least I\r\n      soon fancied that my success would be complete\xe2\x80\x94and I am sure that\r\n      all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.\r\n\r\n      For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that\r\n      any human being could have been prepared.\r\n\r\n      As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cdead! dead!\xe2\x80\x9d absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from\r\n      the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once\xe2\x80\x94within the\r\n      space of a single minute, or even less,\r\n      shrunk\xe2\x80\x94crumbled\xe2\x80\x94absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the\r\n      bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of\r\n      loathsome\xe2\x80\x94of detestable putrescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK CAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n      For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to\r\n      pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be\r\n      to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own\r\n      evidence. Yet, mad am I not\xe2\x80\x94and very surely do I not dream. But\r\n      to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My\r\n      immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly,\r\n      succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household\r\n      events. In their consequences, these events have terrified\xe2\x80\x94have\r\n      tortured\xe2\x80\x94have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound\r\n      them. To me, they have presented little but horror\xe2\x80\x94to many they\r\n      will seem less terrible than _barroques_. Hereafter, perhaps,\r\n      some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the\r\n      common-place\xe2\x80\x94some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less\r\n      excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances\r\n      I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of\r\n      very natural causes and effects.\r\n\r\n      From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my\r\n      disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to\r\n      make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of\r\n      animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of\r\n      pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy\r\n      as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character\r\n      grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of\r\n      my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an\r\n      affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at\r\n      the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the\r\n      gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish\r\n      and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the\r\n      heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry\r\n      friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere _Man_.\r\n\r\n      I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition\r\n      not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic\r\n      pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most\r\n      agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a\r\n      small monkey, and _a cat_.\r\n\r\n      This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely\r\n      black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his\r\n      intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured\r\n      with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular\r\n      notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not\r\n      that she was ever _serious_ upon this point\xe2\x80\x94and I mention the\r\n      matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just\r\n      now, to be remembered.\r\n\r\n      Pluto\xe2\x80\x94this was the cat\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94was my favorite pet and playmate. I\r\n      alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the\r\n      house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from\r\n      following me through the streets.\r\n\r\n      Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during\r\n      which my general temperament and character\xe2\x80\x94through the\r\n      instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance\xe2\x80\x94had (I blush to confess\r\n      it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. I grew, day\r\n      by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the\r\n      feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language\r\n      to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My\r\n      pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition.\r\n      I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however, I\r\n      still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating\r\n      him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey,\r\n      or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they\r\n      came in my way. But my disease grew upon me\xe2\x80\x94for what disease is\r\n      like Alcohol!\xe2\x80\x94and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old,\r\n      and consequently somewhat peevish\xe2\x80\x94even Pluto began to experience\r\n      the effects of my ill temper.\r\n\r\n      One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my\r\n      haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I\r\n      seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a\r\n      slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The fury of a demon\r\n      instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul\r\n      seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a more than\r\n      fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my\r\n      frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it,\r\n      grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of\r\n      its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen\r\n      the damnable atrocity.\r\n\r\n      When reason returned with the morning\xe2\x80\x94when I had slept off the\r\n      fumes of the night\xe2\x80\x99s debauch\xe2\x80\x94I experienced a sentiment half of\r\n      horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been\r\n      guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and\r\n      the soul remained untouched. I again plunged into excess, and\r\n      soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.\r\n\r\n      In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost\r\n      eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no\r\n      longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as\r\n      usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my\r\n      approach. I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first\r\n      grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which\r\n      had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to\r\n      irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable\r\n      overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit philosophy\r\n      takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than\r\n      I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the\r\n      human heart\xe2\x80\x94one of the indivisible primary faculties, or\r\n      sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has\r\n      not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly\r\n      action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?\r\n      Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best\r\n      judgment, to violate that which is _Law_, merely because we\r\n      understand it to be such? This spirit of perverseness, I say,\r\n      came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable longing of\r\n      the soul _to vex itself_\xe2\x80\x94to offer violence to its own nature\xe2\x80\x94to\r\n      do wrong for the wrong\xe2\x80\x99s sake only\xe2\x80\x94that urged me to continue and\r\n      finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the\r\n      unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose\r\n      about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;\xe2\x80\x94hung it with\r\n      the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse\r\n      at my heart;\xe2\x80\x94hung it _because_ I knew that it had loved me, and\r\n      _because_ I felt it had given me no reason of offence;\xe2\x80\x94hung it\r\n      _because_ I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin\xe2\x80\x94a deadly\r\n      sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it\xe2\x80\x94if\r\n      such a thing wore possible\xe2\x80\x94even beyond the reach of the infinite\r\n      mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.\r\n\r\n      On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was\r\n      aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed\r\n      were in flames. The whole house was blazing. It was with great\r\n      difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape\r\n      from the conflagration. The destruction was complete. My entire\r\n      worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself\r\n      thenceforward to despair.\r\n\r\n      I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of\r\n      cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am\r\n      detailing a chain of facts\xe2\x80\x94and wish not to leave even a possible\r\n      link imperfect. On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the\r\n      ruins. The walls, with one exception, had fallen in. This\r\n      exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which\r\n      stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested\r\n      the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great measure,\r\n      resisted the action of the fire\xe2\x80\x94a fact which I attributed to its\r\n      having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were\r\n      collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular\r\n      portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cstrange!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csingular!\xe2\x80\x9d and other similar expressions, excited my\r\n      curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in _bas relief_\r\n      upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic _cat_. The\r\n      impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was\r\n      a rope about the animal\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n      When I first beheld this apparition\xe2\x80\x94for I could scarcely regard\r\n      it as less\xe2\x80\x94my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length\r\n      reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung\r\n      in a garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this\r\n      garden had been immediately filled by the crowd\xe2\x80\x94by some one of\r\n      whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown,\r\n      through an open window, into my chamber. This had probably been\r\n      done with the view of arousing me from sleep. The falling of\r\n      other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the\r\n      substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with\r\n      the flames, and the _ammonia_ from the carcass, had then\r\n      accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.\r\n\r\n      Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether\r\n      to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did\r\n      not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For\r\n      months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and,\r\n      during this period, there came back into my spirit a\r\n      half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far\r\n      as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among\r\n      the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another\r\n      pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with\r\n      which to supply its place.\r\n\r\n      One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy,\r\n      my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing\r\n      upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum,\r\n      which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had\r\n      been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some\r\n      minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had\r\n      not sooner perceived the object thereupon. I approached it, and\r\n      touched it with my hand. It was a black cat\xe2\x80\x94a very large\r\n      one\xe2\x80\x94fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every\r\n      respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of\r\n      his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch\r\n      of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Upon my\r\n      touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against\r\n      my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was\r\n      the very creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to\r\n      purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94knew nothing of it\xe2\x80\x94had never seen it before.\r\n\r\n      I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the\r\n      animal evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to\r\n      do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When\r\n      it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became\r\n      immediately a great favorite with my wife.\r\n\r\n      For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me.\r\n      This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\n      not how or why it was\xe2\x80\x94its evident fondness for myself rather\r\n      disgusted and annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust\r\n      and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the\r\n      creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my\r\n      former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it.\r\n      I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use\r\n      it; but gradually\xe2\x80\x94very gradually\xe2\x80\x94I came to look upon it with\r\n      unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious\r\n      presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.\r\n\r\n      What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the\r\n      discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like\r\n      Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes. This\r\n      circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I\r\n      have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of\r\n      feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the\r\n      source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.\r\n\r\n      With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself\r\n      seemed to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity\r\n      which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.\r\n      Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon\r\n      my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses. If I arose to\r\n      walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down,\r\n      or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in\r\n      this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I longed to\r\n      destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly\r\n      by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly\xe2\x80\x94let me confess it at\r\n      once\xe2\x80\x94by absolute dread of the beast.\r\n\r\n      This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil\xe2\x80\x94and yet I\r\n      should be at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost\r\n      ashamed to own\xe2\x80\x94yes, even in this felon\xe2\x80\x99s cell, I am almost\r\n      ashamed to own\xe2\x80\x94that the terror and horror with which the animal\r\n      inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras\r\n      it would be possible to conceive. My wife had called my\r\n      attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white\r\n      hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole\r\n      visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had\r\n      destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although\r\n      large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow\r\n      degrees\xe2\x80\x94degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time\r\n      my reason struggled to reject as fanciful\xe2\x80\x94it had, at length,\r\n      assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the\r\n      representation of an object that I shudder to name\xe2\x80\x94and for this,\r\n      above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of\r\n      the monster _had I dared_\xe2\x80\x94it was now, I say, the image of a\r\n      hideous\xe2\x80\x94of a ghastly thing\xe2\x80\x94of the GALLOWS!\xe2\x80\x94oh, mournful and\r\n      terrible engine of Horror and of Crime\xe2\x80\x94of Agony and of Death!\r\n\r\n      And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere\r\n      Humanity. And _a brute beast _\xe2\x80\x94whose fellow I had contemptuously\r\n      destroyed\xe2\x80\x94_a brute beast_ to work out for _me_\xe2\x80\x94for me a man,\r\n      fashioned in the image of the High God\xe2\x80\x94so much of insufferable\r\n      woe! Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of\r\n      rest any more! During the former the creature left me no moment\r\n      alone, and in the latter I started hourly from dreams of\r\n      unutterable fear to find the hot breath of _the thing_ upon my\r\n      face, and its vast weight\xe2\x80\x94an incarnate nightmare that I had no\r\n      power to shake off\xe2\x80\x94incumbent eternally upon my _heart!_\r\n\r\n      Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble\r\n      remnant of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my\r\n      sole intimates\xe2\x80\x94the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The\r\n      moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things\r\n      and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and\r\n      ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned\r\n      myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas, was the most usual and the\r\n      most patient of sufferers.\r\n\r\n      One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the\r\n      cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to\r\n      inhabit. The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly\r\n      throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an\r\n      axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had\r\n      hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of\r\n      course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I\r\n      wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.\r\n      Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I\r\n      withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.\r\n      She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.\r\n\r\n      This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and\r\n      with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I\r\n      knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or\r\n      by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.\r\n      Many projects entered my mind. At one period I thought of cutting\r\n      the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire. At\r\n      another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the\r\n      cellar. Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the\r\n      yard\xe2\x80\x94about packing it in a box, as if merchandise, with the usual\r\n      arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house.\r\n      Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than\r\n      either of these. I determined to wall it up in the cellar\xe2\x80\x94as the\r\n      monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their\r\n      victims.\r\n\r\n      For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls\r\n      were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered\r\n      throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the\r\n      atmosphere had prevented from hardening. Moreover, in one of the\r\n      walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace,\r\n      that had been filled up, and made to resemble the red of the\r\n      cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks\r\n      at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as\r\n      before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in\r\n      this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I\r\n      easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the\r\n      body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position,\r\n      while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it\r\n      originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with\r\n      every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not\r\n      be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully\r\n      went over the new brickwork. When I had finished, I felt\r\n      satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present the\r\n      slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the\r\n      floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around\r\n      triumphantly, and said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cHere at least, then, my labor\r\n      has not been in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause\r\n      of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to\r\n      put it to death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment,\r\n      there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that\r\n      the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous\r\n      anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood. It is\r\n      impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful\r\n      sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature\r\n      occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance during the\r\n      night; and thus for one night at least, since its introduction\r\n      into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even\r\n      with the burden of murder upon my soul!\r\n\r\n      The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came\r\n      not. Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror,\r\n      had fled the premises forever! I should behold it no more! My\r\n      happiness was supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but\r\n      little. Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been\r\n      readily answered. Even a search had been instituted\xe2\x80\x94but of course\r\n      nothing was to be discovered. I looked upon my future felicity as\r\n      secured.\r\n\r\n      Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police\r\n      came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to\r\n      make rigorous investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in\r\n      the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no\r\n      embarrassment whatever. The officers bade me accompany them in\r\n      their search. They left no nook or corner unexplored. At length,\r\n      for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar. I\r\n      quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of one who\r\n      slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I\r\n      folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The\r\n      police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee\r\n      at my heart was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if\r\n      but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their\r\n      assurance of my guiltlessness.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n      delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health,\r\n      and a little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this\xe2\x80\x94this is a\r\n      very well-constructed house.\xe2\x80\x9d (In the rabid desire to say\r\n      something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI may\r\n      say an _excellently_ well-constructed house. These walls\xe2\x80\x94are you\r\n      going, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x94these walls are solidly put together;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n      here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with\r\n      a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the\r\n      brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.\r\n\r\n      But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the\r\n      Arch-Fiend! No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into\r\n      silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb!\xe2\x80\x94by\r\n      a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child,\r\n      and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous\r\n      scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman\xe2\x80\x94a howl\xe2\x80\x94a wailing shriek,\r\n      half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen\r\n      only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned in\r\n      their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.\r\n\r\n      Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to\r\n      the opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs\r\n      remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In\r\n      the next, a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell\r\n      bodily. The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with\r\n      gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators. Upon its\r\n      head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the\r\n      hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose\r\n      informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the\r\n      monster up within the tomb!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER\r\n\r\n\r\n     Son c\xc5\x93ur est un luth suspendu;\r\n     Sit\xc3\xb4t qu\xe2\x80\x99on le touche il r\xc3\xa9sonne..\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_De B\xc3\xa9ranger_.\r\n\r\n      During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn\r\n      of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the\r\n      heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a\r\n      singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself,\r\n      as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the\r\n      melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was\xe2\x80\x94but, with the\r\n      first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom\r\n      pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was\r\n      unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,\r\n      sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest\r\n      natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the\r\n      scene before me\xe2\x80\x94upon the mere house, and the simple landscape\r\n      features of the domain\xe2\x80\x94upon the bleak walls\xe2\x80\x94upon the vacant\r\n      eye-like windows\xe2\x80\x94upon a few rank sedges\xe2\x80\x94and upon a few white\r\n      trunks of decayed trees\xe2\x80\x94with an utter depression of soul which I\r\n      can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the\r\n      after-dream of the reveller upon opium\xe2\x80\x94the bitter lapse into\r\n      everyday life\xe2\x80\x94the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an\r\n      iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart\xe2\x80\x94an unredeemed\r\n      dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could\r\n      torture into aught of the sublime. What was it\xe2\x80\x94I paused to\r\n      think\xe2\x80\x94what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the\r\n      House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I\r\n      grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I\r\n      pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory\r\n      conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_ combinations of\r\n      very simple natural objects which have the power of thus\r\n      affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among\r\n      considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected,\r\n      that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the\r\n      scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to\r\n      modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful\r\n      impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the\r\n      precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled\r\n      lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down\xe2\x80\x94but with a shudder even\r\n      more thrilling than before\xe2\x80\x94upon the remodelled and inverted\r\n      images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the\r\n      vacant and eye-like windows.\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\r\n      sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been\r\n      one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed\r\n      since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me\r\n      in a distant part of the country\xe2\x80\x94a letter from him\xe2\x80\x94which, in its\r\n      wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a\r\n      personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The\r\n      writer spoke of acute bodily illness\xe2\x80\x94of a mental disorder which\r\n      oppressed him\xe2\x80\x94and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best,\r\n      and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting,\r\n      by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his\r\n      malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was\r\n      said\xe2\x80\x94it was the apparent _heart_ that went with his request\xe2\x80\x94which\r\n      allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed\r\n      forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.\r\n\r\n      Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I\r\n      really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always\r\n      excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very\r\n      ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar\r\n      sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,\r\n      in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in\r\n      repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as\r\n      in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more\r\n      than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical\r\n      science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the\r\n      stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put\r\n      forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that\r\n      the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had\r\n      always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.\r\n      It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in\r\n      thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with\r\n      the accredited character of the people, and while speculating\r\n      upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of\r\n      centuries, might have exercised upon the other\xe2\x80\x94it was this\r\n      deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent\r\n      undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with\r\n      the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge\r\n      the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\r\n      appellation of the \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of Usher\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an appellation which seemed\r\n      to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the\r\n      family and the family mansion.\r\n\r\n      I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish\r\n      experiment\xe2\x80\x94that of looking down within the tarn\xe2\x80\x94had been to\r\n      deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that\r\n      the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition\xe2\x80\x94for\r\n      why should I not so term it?\xe2\x80\x94served mainly to accelerate the\r\n      increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law\r\n      of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have\r\n      been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to\r\n      the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my\r\n      mind a strange fancy\xe2\x80\x94a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but\r\n      mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which\r\n      oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to\r\n      believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an\r\n      atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity\xe2\x80\x94an\r\n      atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but\r\n      which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall,\r\n      and the silent tarn\xe2\x80\x94a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish,\r\n      faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\r\n\r\n      Shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I\r\n      scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its\r\n      principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.\r\n      The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread\r\n      the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the\r\n      eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary\r\n      dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there\r\n      appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect\r\n      adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the\r\n      individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the\r\n      specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long\r\n      years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the\r\n      breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive\r\n      decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.\r\n      Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered\r\n      a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of\r\n      the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag\r\n      direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.\r\n\r\n      Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house.\r\n      A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic\r\n      archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted\r\n      me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my\r\n      progress to the _studio_ of his master. Much that I encountered\r\n      on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague\r\n      sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects\r\n      around me\xe2\x80\x94while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre\r\n      tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and\r\n      the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode,\r\n      were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been\r\n      accustomed from my infancy\xe2\x80\x94while I hesitated not to acknowledge\r\n      how familiar was all this\xe2\x80\x94I still wondered to find how unfamiliar\r\n      were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one\r\n      of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His\r\n      countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning\r\n      and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.\r\n      The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence\r\n      of his master.\r\n\r\n      The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The\r\n      windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance\r\n      from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from\r\n      within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through\r\n      the trellissed panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct\r\n      the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in\r\n      vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses\r\n      of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the\r\n      walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique,\r\n      and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered\r\n      about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that\r\n      I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and\r\n      irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\r\n\r\n      Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been\r\n      lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth\r\n      which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone\r\n      cordiality\xe2\x80\x94of the constrained effort of the _ennuy\xc3\xa9_ man of the\r\n      world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his\r\n      perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he\r\n      spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of\r\n      awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so\r\n      brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty\r\n      that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being\r\n      before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the\r\n      character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A\r\n      cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous\r\n      beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a\r\n      surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,\r\n      but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a\r\n      finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a\r\n      want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and\r\n      tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the\r\n      regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not\r\n      easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the\r\n      prevailing character of these features, and of the expression\r\n      they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to\r\n      whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now\r\n      miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even\r\n      awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all\r\n      unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather\r\n      than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect\r\n      its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\r\n\r\n      In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an\r\n      incoherence\xe2\x80\x94an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from\r\n      a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual\r\n      trepidancy\xe2\x80\x94an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this\r\n      nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by\r\n      reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions\r\n      deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament.\r\n      His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied\r\n      rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits\r\n      seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic\r\n      concision\xe2\x80\x94that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding\r\n      enunciation\xe2\x80\x94that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated\r\n      guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard,\r\n      or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his\r\n      most intense excitement.\r\n\r\n      It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his\r\n      earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to\r\n      afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to\r\n      be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional\r\n      and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a\r\n      remedy\xe2\x80\x94a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which\r\n      would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of\r\n      unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them,\r\n      interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and\r\n      the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered\r\n      much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food\r\n      was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain\r\n      texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were\r\n      tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar\r\n      sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not\r\n      inspire him with horror.\r\n\r\n      To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n      shall perish,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI must perish in this deplorable folly.\r\n      Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the\r\n      events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I\r\n      shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident,\r\n      which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I\r\n      have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute\r\n      effect\xe2\x80\x94in terror. In this unnerved\xe2\x80\x94in this pitiable condition\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must\r\n      abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\r\n      phantasm, FEAR.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\r\n      equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental\r\n      condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions\r\n      in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many\r\n      years, he had never ventured forth\xe2\x80\x94in regard to an influence\r\n      whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here\r\n      to be re-stated\xe2\x80\x94an influence which some peculiarities in the mere\r\n      form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long\r\n      sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit\xe2\x80\x94an effect which the\r\n      _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn\r\n      into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about\r\n      upon the _morale_ of his existence.\r\n\r\n      He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the\r\n      peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more\r\n      natural and far more palpable origin\xe2\x80\x94to the severe and\r\n      long-continued illness\xe2\x80\x94indeed to the evidently approaching\r\n      dissolution\xe2\x80\x94of a tenderly beloved sister\xe2\x80\x94his sole companion for\r\n      long years\xe2\x80\x94his last and only relative on earth. \xe2\x80\x9cHer decease,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n      said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \xe2\x80\x9cwould leave\r\n      him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race\r\n      of the Ushers.\xe2\x80\x9d While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she\r\n      called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment,\r\n      and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded\r\n      her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread\xe2\x80\x94and yet I\r\n      found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of\r\n      stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.\r\n      When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought\r\n      instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother\xe2\x80\x94but he\r\n      had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that\r\n      a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated\r\n      fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\r\n\r\n      The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of\r\n      her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the\r\n      person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially\r\n      cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she\r\n      had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had\r\n      not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the\r\n      evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother\r\n      told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating\r\n      power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had\r\n      obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should\r\n      obtain\xe2\x80\x94that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me\r\n      no more.\r\n\r\n      For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either\r\n      Usher or myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest\r\n      endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted\r\n      and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild\r\n      improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and\r\n      still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the\r\n      recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the\r\n      futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness,\r\n      as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects\r\n      of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of\r\n      gloom.\r\n\r\n      I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I\r\n      thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I\r\n      should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact\r\n      character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he\r\n      involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered\r\n      ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all. His long improvised\r\n      dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold\r\n      painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification\r\n      of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the\r\n      paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew,\r\n      touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more\r\n      thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why\xe2\x80\x94from these\r\n      paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in\r\n      vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie\r\n      within the compass of merely written words. By the utter\r\n      simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and\r\n      overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal\r\n      was Roderick Usher. For me at least\xe2\x80\x94in the circumstances then\r\n      surrounding me\xe2\x80\x94there arose out of the pure abstractions which the\r\n      hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity\r\n      of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the\r\n      contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries\r\n      of Fuseli.\r\n\r\n      One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not\r\n      so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth,\r\n      although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior\r\n      of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low\r\n      walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain\r\n      accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea\r\n      that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface\r\n      of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast\r\n      extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was\r\n      discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and\r\n      bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.\r\n\r\n      I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve\r\n      which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the\r\n      exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was,\r\n      perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon\r\n      the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic\r\n      character of his performances. But the fervid _facility_ of his\r\n      _impromptus_ could not be so accounted for. They must have been,\r\n      and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild\r\n      fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with\r\n      rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental\r\n      collectedness and concentration to which I have previously\r\n      alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest\r\n      artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I\r\n      have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly\r\n      impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic\r\n      current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the\r\n      first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher of the\r\n      tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which\r\n      were entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Haunted Palace,\xe2\x80\x9d ran very nearly, if not\r\n      accurately, thus:\r\n\r\n                        I.\r\n     In the greenest of our valleys,\r\n    By good angels tenanted,\r\n     Once a fair and stately palace\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Radiant palace\xe2\x80\x94reared its head.\r\n     In the monarch Thought\xe2\x80\x99s dominion\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    It stood there!\r\n     Never seraph spread a pinion\r\n    Over fabric half so fair.\r\n\r\n                        II.\r\n     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,\r\n    On its roof did float and flow;\r\n     (This\xe2\x80\x94all this\xe2\x80\x94was in the olden\r\n    Time long ago)\r\n     And every gentle air that dallied,\r\n    In that sweet day,\r\n     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,\r\n    A winged odor went away.\r\n\r\n                        III.\r\n     Wanderers in that happy valley\r\n    Through two luminous windows saw\r\n     Spirits moving musically\r\n    To a lute\xe2\x80\x99s well-tun\xc3\xa9d law,\r\n     Round about a throne, where sitting\r\n    (Porphyrogene!)\r\n     In state his glory well befitting,\r\n    The ruler of the realm was seen.\r\n\r\n                        IV.\r\n     And all with pearl and ruby glowing\r\n    Was the fair palace door,\r\n     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,\r\n    And sparkling evermore,\r\n     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\r\n    Was but to sing,\r\n     In voices of surpassing beauty,\r\n    The wit and wisdom of their king.\r\n\r\n                        V.\r\n     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,\r\n    Assailed the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s high estate;\r\n     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\r\n    Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)\r\n     And, round about his home, the glory\r\n    That blushed and bloomed\r\n     Is but a dim-remembered story\r\n    Of the old time entombed.\r\n\r\n                        VI.\r\n     And travellers now within that valley,\r\n    Through the red-litten windows, see\r\n     Vast forms that move fantastically\r\n    To a discordant melody;\r\n     While, like a rapid ghastly river,\r\n    Through the pale door,\r\n     A hideous throng rush out forever,\r\n    And laugh\xe2\x80\x94but smile no more.\r\n\r\n      I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us\r\n      into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion\r\n      of Usher\xe2\x80\x99s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty,\r\n      (for other men * have thought thus,) as on account of the\r\n      pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its\r\n      general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.\r\n      But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring\r\n      character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the\r\n      kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full\r\n      extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief,\r\n      however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the\r\n      gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the\r\n      sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of\r\n      collocation of these stones\xe2\x80\x94in the order of their arrangement, as\r\n      well as in that of the many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of\r\n      the decayed trees which stood around\xe2\x80\x94above all, in the long\r\n      undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its\r\n      reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      evidence of the sentience\xe2\x80\x94was to be seen, he said, (and I here\r\n      started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of\r\n      an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The\r\n      result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet\r\n      importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had\r\n      moulded the destinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I\r\n      now saw him\xe2\x80\x94what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I\r\n      will make none.\r\n\r\n      * Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of\r\n      Landaff.\xe2\x80\x94See \xe2\x80\x9cChemical Essays,\xe2\x80\x9d vol v.\r\n\r\n      Our books\xe2\x80\x94the books which, for years, had formed no small portion\r\n      of the mental existence of the invalid\xe2\x80\x94were, as might be\r\n      supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We\r\n      pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of\r\n      Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of\r\n      Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg;\r\n      the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D\xe2\x80\x99Indagin\xc3\xa9, and of De la\r\n      Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the\r\n      City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was a small\r\n      octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorium_, by the\r\n      Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in\r\n      Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over\r\n      which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight,\r\n      however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and\r\n      curious book in quarto Gothic\xe2\x80\x94the manual of a forgotten\r\n      church\xe2\x80\x94the _Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae\r\n      Maguntinae_.\r\n\r\n      I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of\r\n      its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening,\r\n      having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more,\r\n      he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight,\r\n      (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous\r\n      vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason,\r\n      however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I\r\n      did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to\r\n      his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual\r\n      character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and\r\n      eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote\r\n      and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will\r\n      not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of\r\n      the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my\r\n      arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded\r\n      as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural,\r\n      precaution.\r\n\r\n      At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the\r\n      arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been\r\n      encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which\r\n      we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our\r\n      torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us\r\n      little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and\r\n      entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great\r\n      depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which\r\n      was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in\r\n      remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep,\r\n      and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some\r\n      other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,\r\n      and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached\r\n      it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive\r\n      iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight\r\n      caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its\r\n      hinges.\r\n\r\n      Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this\r\n      region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid\r\n      of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking\r\n      similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my\r\n      attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured\r\n      out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and\r\n      himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely\r\n      intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances,\r\n      however, rested not long upon the dead\xe2\x80\x94for we could not regard\r\n      her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the\r\n      maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a\r\n      strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush\r\n      upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering\r\n      smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and\r\n      screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made\r\n      our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of\r\n      the upper portion of the house.\r\n\r\n      And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable\r\n      change came over the features of the mental disorder of my\r\n      friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary\r\n      occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber\r\n      to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor\r\n      of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly\r\n      hue\xe2\x80\x94but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The\r\n      once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a\r\n      tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually\r\n      characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I\r\n      thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some\r\n      oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the\r\n      necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all\r\n      into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him\r\n      gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the\r\n      profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.\r\n      It was no wonder that his condition terrified\xe2\x80\x94that it infected\r\n      me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the\r\n      wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive\r\n      superstitions.\r\n\r\n      It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the\r\n      seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline\r\n      within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such\r\n      feelings. Sleep came not near my couch\xe2\x80\x94while the hours waned and\r\n      waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had\r\n      dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that much, if not all\r\n      of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the\r\n      gloomy furniture of the room\xe2\x80\x94of the dark and tattered draperies,\r\n      which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest,\r\n      swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily\r\n      about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless.\r\n      An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at\r\n      length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly\r\n      causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I\r\n      uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within\r\n      the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened\xe2\x80\x94I know not why,\r\n      except that an instinctive spirit prompted me\xe2\x80\x94to certain low and\r\n      indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at\r\n      long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense\r\n      sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my\r\n      clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during\r\n      the night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable\r\n      condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro\r\n      through the apartment.\r\n\r\n      I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an\r\n      adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised\r\n      it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a\r\n      gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His\r\n      countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan\xe2\x80\x94but, moreover, there\r\n      was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes\xe2\x80\x94an evidently restrained\r\n      _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. His air appalled me\xe2\x80\x94but\r\n      anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long\r\n      endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have not seen it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly, after having stared\r\n      about him for some moments in silence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou have not then seen\r\n      it?\xe2\x80\x94but, stay! you shall.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus speaking, and having carefully\r\n      shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it\r\n      freely open to the storm.\r\n\r\n      The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our\r\n      feet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night,\r\n      and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind\r\n      had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there\r\n      were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the\r\n      wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low\r\n      as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our\r\n      perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering\r\n      from all points against each other, without passing away into the\r\n      distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent\r\n      our perceiving this\xe2\x80\x94yet we had no glimpse of the moon or\r\n      stars\xe2\x80\x94nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the\r\n      under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as\r\n      all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in\r\n      the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible\r\n      gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not\xe2\x80\x94you shall not behold this!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shudderingly,\r\n      to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window\r\n      to a seat. \xe2\x80\x9cThese appearances, which bewilder you, are merely\r\n      electrical phenomena not uncommon\xe2\x80\x94or it may be that they have\r\n      their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close\r\n      this casement;\xe2\x80\x94the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.\r\n      Here is one of your favorite romances. I will read, and you shall\r\n      listen;\xe2\x80\x94and so we will pass away this terrible night together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The antique volume which I had taken up was the \xe2\x80\x9cMad Trist\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\n      Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little\r\n      in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had\r\n      interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It\r\n      was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a\r\n      vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the\r\n      hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental\r\n      disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of\r\n      the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by\r\n      the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or\r\n      apparently harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have\r\n      congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\r\n\r\n      I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where\r\n      Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for\r\n      peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to\r\n      make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the\r\n      words of the narrative run thus:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was\r\n      now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine\r\n      which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the\r\n      hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn,\r\n      but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising\r\n      of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made\r\n      quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted\r\n      hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and\r\n      ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and\r\n      hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the\r\n      forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment,\r\n      paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that\r\n      my excited fancy had deceived me)\xe2\x80\x94it appeared to me that, from\r\n      some very remote portion of the mansion, there came,\r\n      indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact\r\n      similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one\r\n      certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir\r\n      Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt,\r\n      the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid\r\n      the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary\r\n      commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in\r\n      itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or\r\n      disturbed me. I continued the story:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door,\r\n      was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the\r\n      maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly\r\n      and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in\r\n      guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon\r\n      the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend\r\n      enwritten\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\r\n     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\r\n\r\n      And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the\r\n      dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with\r\n      a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that\r\n      Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the\r\n      dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild\r\n      amazement\xe2\x80\x94for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this\r\n      instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it\r\n      proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently\r\n      distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or\r\n      grating sound\xe2\x80\x94the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already\r\n      conjured up for the dragon\xe2\x80\x99s unnatural shriek as described by the\r\n      romancer.\r\n\r\n      Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second\r\n      and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting\r\n      sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant,\r\n      I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting,\r\n      by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I\r\n      was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in\r\n      question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during\r\n      the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. From a\r\n      position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his\r\n      chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and\r\n      thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw\r\n      that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His\r\n      head had dropped upon his breast\xe2\x80\x94yet I knew that he was not\r\n      asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a\r\n      glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at\r\n      variance with this idea\xe2\x80\x94for he rocked from side to side with a\r\n      gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice\r\n      of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus\r\n      proceeded:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of\r\n      the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the\r\n      breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the\r\n      carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously\r\n      over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was\r\n      upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming,\r\n      but feel down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty\r\n      great and terrible ringing sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than\xe2\x80\x94as if a shield\r\n      of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor\r\n      of silver\xe2\x80\x94I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and\r\n      clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely\r\n      unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement\r\n      of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat.\r\n      His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole\r\n      countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my\r\n      hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his\r\n      whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw\r\n      that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if\r\n      unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length\r\n      drank in the hideous import of his words.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot hear it?\xe2\x80\x94yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.\r\n      Long\xe2\x80\x94long\xe2\x80\x94long\xe2\x80\x94many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94yet I dared not\xe2\x80\x94oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      dared not\xe2\x80\x94I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the\r\n      tomb!_ Said I not that my senses were acute? I _now_ tell you\r\n      that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I\r\n      heard them\xe2\x80\x94many, many days ago\xe2\x80\x94yet I dared not\xe2\x80\x94_I dared not\r\n      speak!_ And now\xe2\x80\x94to-night\xe2\x80\x94Ethelred\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94the breaking of the\r\n      hermit\xe2\x80\x99s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor\r\n      of the shield!\xe2\x80\x94say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the\r\n      grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles\r\n      within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly?\r\n      Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for\r\n      my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not\r\n      distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?\r\n      Madman!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out\r\n      his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his\r\n      soul\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Madman! I tell you that she now stands without the door!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been\r\n      found the potency of a spell\xe2\x80\x94the huge antique pannels to which\r\n      the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their\r\n      ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust\xe2\x80\x94but\r\n      then without those doors there _did_ stand the lofty and\r\n      enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood\r\n      upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle\r\n      upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she\r\n      remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the\r\n      threshold\xe2\x80\x94then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon\r\n      the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final\r\n      death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to\r\n      the terrors he had anticipated.\r\n\r\n      From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The\r\n      storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself\r\n      crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a\r\n      wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could\r\n      have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind\r\n      me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red\r\n      moon, which now shone vividly through that once\r\n      barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as\r\n      extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction,\r\n      to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened\xe2\x80\x94there\r\n      came a fierce breath of the whirlwind\xe2\x80\x94the entire orb of the\r\n      satellite burst at once upon my sight\xe2\x80\x94my brain reeled as I saw\r\n      the mighty walls rushing asunder\xe2\x80\x94there was a long tumultuous\r\n      shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters\xe2\x80\x94and the deep\r\n      and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the\r\n      fragments of the \xe2\x80\x9c_House of Usher_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILENCE\xe2\x80\x94A FABLE\r\n\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and caves _are\r\n     silent_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my\r\n      head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya,\r\n      by the borders of the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there,\r\n      nor silence.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they\r\n      flow not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever\r\n      beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive\r\n      motion. For many miles on either side of the river\xe2\x80\x99s oozy bed is\r\n      a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the\r\n      other in that solitude, and stretch towards the heaven their long\r\n      and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads.\r\n      And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among\r\n      them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto\r\n      the other.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is a boundary to their realm\xe2\x80\x94the boundary of the dark,\r\n      horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides,\r\n      the low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind\r\n      throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally\r\n      hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from\r\n      their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the\r\n      roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed\r\n      slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray\r\n      clouds rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over\r\n      the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout\r\n      the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither\r\n      quiet nor silence.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but,\r\n      having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the\r\n      tall and the rain fell upon my head\xe2\x80\x94and the lilies sighed one\r\n      unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist,\r\n      and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray\r\n      rock which stood by the shore of the river, and was lighted by\r\n      the light of the moon. And the rock was gray, and ghastly, and\r\n      tall,\xe2\x80\x94and the rock was gray. Upon its front were characters\r\n      engraven in the stone; and I walked through the morass of\r\n      water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might\r\n      read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher\r\n      them. And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone\r\n      with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock,\r\n      and upon the characters, and the characters were DESOLATION.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of\r\n      the rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might\r\n      discover the actions of the man. And the man was tall and stately\r\n      in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the\r\n      toga of old Rome. And the outlines of his figure were\r\n      indistinct\xe2\x80\x94but his features were the features of a deity; for the\r\n      mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the\r\n      dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow\r\n      was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the\r\n      few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and\r\n      weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after\r\n      solitude.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his\r\n      hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the\r\n      low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and\r\n      up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And\r\n      I lay close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the\r\n      actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\n      night waned, and he sat upon the rock.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out\r\n      upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters,\r\n      and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man\r\n      listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that\r\n      came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and\r\n      observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the\r\n      solitude;\xe2\x80\x94but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar\r\n      in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the\r\n      hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the\r\n      morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the\r\n      behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and\r\n      fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert and\r\n      observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the\r\n      solitude;\xe2\x80\x94but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a\r\n      frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had\r\n      been no wind. And the heaven became livid with the violence of\r\n      the tempest\xe2\x80\x94and the rain beat upon the head of the man\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\n      floods of the river came down\xe2\x80\x94and the river was tormented into\r\n      foam\xe2\x80\x94and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\n      forest crumbled before the wind\xe2\x80\x94and the thunder rolled\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\n      lightning fell\xe2\x80\x94and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay\r\n      close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And\r\n      the man trembled in the solitude;\xe2\x80\x94but the night waned and he sat\r\n      upon the rock.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the\r\n      river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the\r\n      heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And\r\n      they became accursed, and were still. And the moon ceased to\r\n      totter up its pathway to heaven\xe2\x80\x94and the thunder died away\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\n      lightning did not flash\xe2\x80\x94and the clouds hung motionless\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\n      waters sunk to their level and remained\xe2\x80\x94and the trees ceased to\r\n      rock\xe2\x80\x94and the water-lilies sighed no more\xe2\x80\x94and the murmur was heard\r\n      no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the\r\n      vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the\r\n      rock, and they were changed; and the characters were SILENCE.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his\r\n      countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his\r\n      head from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened.\r\n      But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert,\r\n      and the characters upon the rock were SILENCE. And the man\r\n      shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar off, in haste,\r\n      so that I beheld him no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\n      iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are\r\n      glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the\r\n      mighty sea\xe2\x80\x94and of the Genii that over-ruled the sea, and the\r\n      earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much lore too in the\r\n      sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy, holy things were\r\n      heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around Dodona\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\n      as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as he sat by\r\n      my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most\r\n      wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he\r\n      fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could\r\n      not laugh with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not\r\n      laugh. And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out\r\n      therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at\r\n      him steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The \xe2\x80\x9cRed Death\xe2\x80\x9d had long devastated the country. No pestilence\r\n      had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and\r\n      its seal\xe2\x80\x94the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp\r\n      pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the\r\n      pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and\r\n      especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which\r\n      shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his\r\n      fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of\r\n      the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.\r\n\r\n      But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious.\r\n      When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his\r\n      presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the\r\n      knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the\r\n      deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an\r\n      extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled\r\n      it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having\r\n      entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.\r\n      They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the\r\n      sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey\r\n      was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might\r\n      bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of\r\n      itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The\r\n      prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were\r\n      buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers,\r\n      there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these\r\n      and security were within. Without was the \xe2\x80\x9cRed Death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his\r\n      seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad,\r\n      that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a\r\n      masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.\r\n\r\n      It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell\r\n      of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven\xe2\x80\x94an imperial\r\n      suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and\r\n      straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the\r\n      walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is\r\n      scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different; as might have\r\n      been expected from the duke\xe2\x80\x99s love of the bizarre. The apartments\r\n      were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little\r\n      more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty\r\n      or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right\r\n      and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic\r\n      window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the\r\n      windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose\r\n      color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the\r\n      decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the\r\n      eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue\xe2\x80\x94and vividly blue\r\n      were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments\r\n      and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was\r\n      green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was\r\n      furnished and lighted with orange\xe2\x80\x94the fifth with white\xe2\x80\x94the sixth\r\n      with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black\r\n      velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the\r\n      walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material\r\n      and hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows\r\n      failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were\r\n      scarlet\xe2\x80\x94a deep blood color. Now in no one of the seven apartments\r\n      was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden\r\n      ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the\r\n      roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or\r\n      candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that\r\n      followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy\r\n      tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through\r\n      the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus\r\n      were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But\r\n      in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that\r\n      streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes,\r\n      was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the\r\n      countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the\r\n      company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\r\n\r\n      It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the\r\n      western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to\r\n      and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the\r\n      minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be\r\n      stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound\r\n      which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of\r\n      so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour,\r\n      the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,\r\n      momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and\r\n      thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was\r\n      a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the\r\n      chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest\r\n      grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over\r\n      their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when the\r\n      echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the\r\n      assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at\r\n      their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each\r\n      to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce\r\n      in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty\r\n      minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of\r\n      the Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the\r\n      clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and\r\n      meditation as before.\r\n\r\n      But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent\r\n      revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye\r\n      for colors and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere\r\n      fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions\r\n      glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have\r\n      thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was\r\n      necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was\r\n      not.\r\n\r\n      He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of\r\n      the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great f\xc3\xaate; and it was\r\n      his own guiding taste which had given character to the\r\n      masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare\r\n      and glitter and piquancy and phantasm\xe2\x80\x94much of what has been since\r\n      seen in \xe2\x80\x9cHernani.\xe2\x80\x9d There were arabesque figures with unsuited\r\n      limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the\r\n      madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the\r\n      wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a\r\n      little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in\r\n      the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.\r\n      And these\xe2\x80\x94the dreams\xe2\x80\x94writhed in and about, taking hue from the\r\n      rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the\r\n      echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock\r\n      which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment,\r\n      all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The\r\n      dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the\r\n      chime die away\xe2\x80\x94they have endured but an instant\xe2\x80\x94and a light,\r\n      half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now\r\n      again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and\r\n      fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted\r\n      windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to\r\n      the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are\r\n      now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning\r\n      away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored\r\n      panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him\r\n      whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near\r\n      clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any\r\n      which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties\r\n      of the other apartments.\r\n\r\n      But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\r\n      feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on,\r\n      until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the\r\n      clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the\r\n      evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy\r\n      cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve\r\n      strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it\r\n      happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,\r\n      into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.\r\n      And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes\r\n      of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many\r\n      individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of\r\n      the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention\r\n      of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new\r\n      presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at\r\n      length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of\r\n      disapprobation and surprise\xe2\x80\x94then, finally, of terror, of horror,\r\n      and of disgust.\r\n\r\n      In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well\r\n      be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such\r\n      sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was\r\n      nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded\r\n      Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince\xe2\x80\x99s indefinite\r\n      decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless\r\n      which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly\r\n      lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters\r\n      of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed\r\n      now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the\r\n      stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall\r\n      and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of\r\n      the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly\r\n      to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the\r\n      closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.\r\n      And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the\r\n      mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume\r\n      the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was\r\n      besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\r\n\r\n      When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image\r\n      (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to\r\n      sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was\r\n      seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder\r\n      either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened\r\n      with rage.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWho dares?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\r\n      him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him\r\n      and unmask him\xe2\x80\x94that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise,\r\n      from the battlements!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince\r\n      Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the\r\n      seven rooms loudly and clearly\xe2\x80\x94for the prince was a bold and\r\n      robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his\r\n      hand.\r\n\r\n      It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of\r\n      pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a\r\n      slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the\r\n      intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with\r\n      deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker.\r\n      But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of\r\n      the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none\r\n      who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed\r\n      within a yard of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s person; and, while the vast\r\n      assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the\r\n      rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the\r\n      same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from\r\n      the first, through the blue chamber to the purple\xe2\x80\x94through the\r\n      purple to the green\xe2\x80\x94through the green to the orange\xe2\x80\x94through this\r\n      again to the white\xe2\x80\x94and even thence to the violet, ere a decided\r\n      movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that\r\n      the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own\r\n      momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers,\r\n      while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had\r\n      seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had\r\n      approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of\r\n      the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the\r\n      extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted\r\n      his pursuer. There was a sharp cry\xe2\x80\x94and the dagger dropped\r\n      gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards,\r\n      fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the\r\n      wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw\r\n      themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer,\r\n      whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of\r\n      the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the\r\n      grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so\r\n      violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\r\n\r\n      And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had\r\n      come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the\r\n      revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died\r\n      each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the\r\n      ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the\r\n      flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red\r\n      Death held illimitable dominion over all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could;\r\n      but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so\r\n      well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that\r\n      I gave utterance to a threat. _At length_ I would be avenged;\r\n      this was a point definitively settled\xe2\x80\x94but the very definitiveness\r\n      with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must\r\n      not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed\r\n      when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally\r\n      unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such\r\n      to him who has done the wrong.\r\n\r\n      It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given\r\n      Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my\r\n      wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile\r\n      _now_ was at the thought of his immolation.\r\n\r\n      He had a weak point\xe2\x80\x94this Fortunato\xe2\x80\x94although in other regards he\r\n      was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on\r\n      his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso\r\n      spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the\r\n      time and opportunity\xe2\x80\x94to practise imposture upon the British and\r\n      Austrian _millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like\r\n      his countrymen, was a quack\xe2\x80\x94but in the matter of old wines he was\r\n      sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I\r\n      was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely\r\n      whenever I could.\r\n\r\n      It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the\r\n      carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me\r\n      with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man\r\n      wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and\r\n      his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so\r\n      pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done\r\n      wringing his hand.\r\n\r\n      I said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How\r\n      remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a\r\n      pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAmontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the\r\n      middle of the carnival!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand I was silly enough to pay the\r\n      full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You\r\n      were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmontillado!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmontillado!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must satisfy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAmontillado!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAs you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a\r\n      critical turn, it is he. He will tell me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLuchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for\r\n      your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome, let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo your vaults.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I\r\n      perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have no engagement;\xe2\x80\x94come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold\r\n      with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are\r\n      insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing.\r\n      Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he\r\n      cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on\r\n      a mask of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my\r\n      person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\r\n\r\n      There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make\r\n      merry in honor of the time. I had told them that I should not\r\n      return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not\r\n      to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well\r\n      knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as\r\n      soon as my back was turned.\r\n\r\n      I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to\r\n      Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the\r\n      archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and\r\n      winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed.\r\n      We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together\r\n      on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\r\n\r\n      The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap\r\n      jingled as he strode.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe pipe,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is farther on,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut observe the white web-work which\r\n      gleams from these cavern walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs\r\n      that distilled the rheum of intoxication.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNitre?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, at length.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNitre,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you had that cough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cUgh! ugh! ugh!\xe2\x80\x94ugh! ugh! ugh!\xe2\x80\x94ugh! ugh! ugh!\xe2\x80\x94ugh! ugh! ugh!\xe2\x80\x94ugh!\r\n      ugh! ugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with decision, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will go back; your health is\r\n      precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are\r\n      happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no\r\n      matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be\r\n      responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill\r\n      me. I shall not die of a cough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94true,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand, indeed, I had no intention of\r\n      alarming you unnecessarily\xe2\x80\x94but you should use all proper caution.\r\n      A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long\r\n      row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDrink,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, presenting him the wine.\r\n\r\n      He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me\r\n      familiarly, while his bells jingled.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI drink,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto the buried that repose around us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I to your long life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      He again took my arm, and we proceeded.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThese vaults,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care extensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Montresors,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwere a great and numerous family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI forget your arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA huge human foot d\xe2\x80\x99or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a\r\n      serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the motto?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n      The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy\r\n      grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled\r\n      bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost\r\n      recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made\r\n      bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe nitre!\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9csee, it increases. It hangs like moss upon\r\n      the vaults. We are below the river\xe2\x80\x99s bed. The drops of moisture\r\n      trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too\r\n      late. Your cough\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9clet us go on. But first, another\r\n      draught of the Medoc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I broke and reached him a flagon of De Gr\xc3\xa2ve. He emptied it at a\r\n      breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and\r\n      threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not\r\n      understand.\r\n\r\n      I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement\xe2\x80\x94a grotesque\r\n      one.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not comprehend?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThen you are not of the brotherhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not of the masons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou? Impossible! A mason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA mason,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cA sign,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is this,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the\r\n      folds of my _roquelaire_.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou jest,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \xe2\x80\x9cBut let us\r\n      proceed to the Amontillado.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and\r\n      again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We\r\n      continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed\r\n      through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and\r\n      descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness\r\n      of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.\r\n\r\n      At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\r\n      spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to\r\n      the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of\r\n      Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented\r\n      in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down,\r\n      and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a\r\n      mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the\r\n      displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in\r\n      depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It\r\n      seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself,\r\n      but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal\r\n      supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of\r\n      their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\r\n\r\n      It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch,\r\n      endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination\r\n      the feeble light did not enable us to see.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cProceed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cherein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an ignoramus,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted my friend, as he stepped\r\n      unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In\r\n      an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding\r\n      his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A\r\n      moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface\r\n      were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet,\r\n      horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the\r\n      other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but\r\n      the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded\r\n      to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cPass your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cover the wall; you cannot help feeling\r\n      the nitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_\r\n      you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must\r\n      first render you all the little attentions in my power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Amontillado!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from\r\n      his astonishment.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Amontillado.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of\r\n      which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered\r\n      a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and\r\n      with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the\r\n      entrance of the niche.\r\n\r\n      I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I\r\n      discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great\r\n      measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low\r\n      moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was _not_ the cry of\r\n      a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I\r\n      laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I\r\n      heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for\r\n      several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with\r\n      the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the\r\n      bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,\r\n      and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the\r\n      seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my\r\n      breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the\r\n      mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.\r\n\r\n      A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from\r\n      the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently\r\n      back. For a brief moment I hesitated\xe2\x80\x94I trembled. Unsheathing my\r\n      rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the\r\n      thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the\r\n      solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached\r\n      the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamored. I\r\n      re-echoed\xe2\x80\x94I aided\xe2\x80\x94I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I\r\n      did this, and the clamorer grew still.\r\n\r\n      It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had\r\n      completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had\r\n      finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained\r\n      but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled\r\n      with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.\r\n      But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected\r\n      the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I\r\n      had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The\r\n      voice said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94he! he!\xe2\x80\x94a very good joke indeed\xe2\x80\x94an excellent jest.\r\n      We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo\xe2\x80\x94he! he!\r\n      he!\xe2\x80\x94over our wine\xe2\x80\x94he! he! he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe Amontillado!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHe! he! he!\xe2\x80\x94he! he! he!\xe2\x80\x94yes, the Amontillado. But is it not\r\n      getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the\r\n      Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9c_For the love of God, Montressor!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the love of God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew\r\n      impatient. I called aloud\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFortunato!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      No answer. I called again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFortunato!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture\r\n      and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a\r\n      jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick\xe2\x80\x94on account of the\r\n      dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labor.\r\n      I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up.\r\n      Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones.\r\n      For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. _In pace\r\n      requiescat!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMP OF THE PERVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\n      In the consideration of the faculties and impulses\xe2\x80\x94of the prima\r\n      mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make\r\n      room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a\r\n      radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally\r\n      overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them. In the\r\n      pure arrogance of the reason, we have all overlooked it. We have\r\n      suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want\r\n      of belief\xe2\x80\x94of faith;\xe2\x80\x94whether it be faith in Revelation, or faith\r\n      in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply\r\n      because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse\xe2\x80\x94for\r\n      the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not\r\n      understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the\r\n      notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;\xe2\x80\x94we could not\r\n      have understood in what manner it might be made to further the\r\n      objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be\r\n      denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all\r\n      metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual\r\n      or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man,\r\n      set himself to imagine designs\xe2\x80\x94to dictate purposes to God. Having\r\n      thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah,\r\n      out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind.\r\n      In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined,\r\n      naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man\r\n      should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness,\r\n      and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man,\r\n      will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be\r\n      God\xe2\x80\x99s will that man should continue his species, we discovered an\r\n      organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with combativeness, with\r\n      ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,\xe2\x80\x94so, in short,\r\n      with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral\r\n      sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these\r\n      arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites,\r\n      whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but\r\n      followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors;\r\n      deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived\r\n      destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his\r\n      Creator.\r\n\r\n      It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify\r\n      (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or\r\n      occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than\r\n      upon the basis of what we took it for granted the Deity intended\r\n      him to do. If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how\r\n      then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into\r\n      being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures,\r\n      how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?\r\n\r\n      Induction, _a posteriori_, would have brought phrenology to\r\n      admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a\r\n      paradoxical something, which we may call _perverseness_, for want\r\n      of a more characteristic term. In the sense I intend, it is, in\r\n      fact, a _mobile_ without motive, a motive not _motivirt_. Through\r\n      its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this\r\n      shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far\r\n      modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we\r\n      act, for the reason that we should _not_. In theory, no reason\r\n      can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more\r\n      strong. With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes\r\n      absolutely irresistible. I am not more certain that I breathe,\r\n      than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is\r\n      often the one unconquerable _force_ which impels us, and alone\r\n      impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency\r\n      to do wrong for the wrong\xe2\x80\x99s sake, admit of analysis, or\r\n      resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive\r\n      impulse\xe2\x80\x94elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we\r\n      persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them,\r\n      our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily\r\n      springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a glance will\r\n      show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological combativeness\r\n      has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our\r\n      safeguard against injury. Its principle regards our well-being;\r\n      and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its\r\n      development. It follows, that the desire to be well must be\r\n      excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a\r\n      modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something\r\n      which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not\r\n      aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.\r\n\r\n      An appeal to one\xe2\x80\x99s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the\r\n      sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and\r\n      thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the\r\n      entire radicalness of the propensity in question. It is not more\r\n      incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives no man who at some\r\n      period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire\r\n      to tantalize a listener by circumlocution. The speaker is aware\r\n      that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is\r\n      usually curt, precise, and clear; the most laconic and luminous\r\n      language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue; it is only\r\n      with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he\r\n      dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet,\r\n      the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and\r\n      parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is\r\n      enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire,\r\n      the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the\r\n      deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of\r\n      all consequences) is indulged.\r\n\r\n      We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We\r\n      know that it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important\r\n      crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy\r\n      and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence\r\n      the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our\r\n      whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be undertaken to-day,\r\n      and yet we put it off until to-morrow; and why? There is no\r\n      answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no\r\n      comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a\r\n      more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very\r\n      increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively\r\n      fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving\r\n      gathers strength as the moments fly. The last hour for action is\r\n      at hand. We tremble with the violence of the conflict within\r\n      us,\xe2\x80\x94of the definite with the indefinite\xe2\x80\x94of the substance with the\r\n      shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the\r\n      shadow which prevails,\xe2\x80\x94we struggle in vain. The clock strikes,\r\n      and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the\r\n      chanticleer-note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It\r\n      flies\xe2\x80\x94it disappears\xe2\x80\x94we are free. The old energy returns. We will\r\n      labor now. Alas, it is too late!\r\n\r\n      We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss\xe2\x80\x94we\r\n      grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the\r\n      danger. Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and\r\n      dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable\r\n      feeling. By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud\r\n      assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which\r\n      arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of this our cloud\r\n      upon the precipice\xe2\x80\x99s edge, there grows into palpability, a shape,\r\n      far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet\r\n      it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills\r\n      the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight\r\n      of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our\r\n      sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a\r\n      height. And this fall\xe2\x80\x94this rushing annihilation\xe2\x80\x94for the very\r\n      reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of\r\n      all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering\r\n      which have ever presented themselves to our imagination\xe2\x80\x94for this\r\n      very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. And because our\r\n      reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the\r\n      most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so\r\n      demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the\r\n      edge of a precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge, for a\r\n      moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for\r\n      reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say,\r\n      that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we\r\n      fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the\r\n      abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.\r\n\r\n      Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them\r\n      resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate\r\n      them because we feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this\r\n      there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem\r\n      this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it\r\n      not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.\r\n\r\n      I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your\r\n      question\xe2\x80\x94that I may explain to you why I am here\xe2\x80\x94that I may\r\n      assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect\r\n      of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting\r\n      this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might\r\n      either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble,\r\n      have fancied me mad. As it is, you will easily perceive that I am\r\n      one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse.\r\n\r\n      It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a\r\n      more thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered\r\n      upon the means of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes,\r\n      because their accomplishment involved a _chance_ of detection. At\r\n      length, in reading some French memoirs, I found an account of a\r\n      nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the\r\n      agency of a candle accidentally poisoned. The idea struck my\r\n      fancy at once. I knew my victim\xe2\x80\x99s habit of reading in bed. I\r\n      knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated. But\r\n      I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe\r\n      the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room\r\n      candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I\r\n      there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed,\r\n      and the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s verdict was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDeath by the visitation of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The\r\n      idea of detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of\r\n      the fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no\r\n      shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict, or\r\n      even to suspect me of the crime. It is inconceivable how rich a\r\n      sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I reflected upon\r\n      my absolute security. For a very long period of time I was\r\n      accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real\r\n      delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my\r\n      sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the\r\n      pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations,\r\n      into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because it\r\n      haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is\r\n      quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our\r\n      ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary\r\n      song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera. Nor will we be\r\n      the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera\r\n      air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually\r\n      catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low\r\n      undertone, the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cI am safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself\r\n      in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables.\r\n      In a fit of petulance, I remodelled them thus: \xe2\x80\x9cI am safe\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\n      safe\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94if I be not fool enough to make open confession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill\r\n      creep to my heart. I had had some experience in these fits of\r\n      perversity (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain),\r\n      and I remembered well that in no instance I had successfully\r\n      resisted their attacks. And now my own casual self-suggestion\r\n      that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of\r\n      which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of\r\n      him whom I had murdered\xe2\x80\x94and beckoned me on to death.\r\n\r\n      At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the\r\n      soul. I walked vigorously\xe2\x80\x94faster\xe2\x80\x94still faster\xe2\x80\x94at length I ran. I\r\n      felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of\r\n      thought overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too\r\n      well understood that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I\r\n      still quickened my pace. I bounded like a madman through the\r\n      crowded thoroughfares. At length, the populace took the alarm,\r\n      and pursued me. I felt then the consummation of my fate. Could I\r\n      have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough voice\r\n      resounded in my ears\xe2\x80\x94a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I\r\n      turned\xe2\x80\x94I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the\r\n      pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and\r\n      then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad\r\n      palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from\r\n      my soul.\r\n\r\n      They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with\r\n      marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of\r\n      interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences\r\n      that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.\r\n\r\n      Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial\r\n      conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.\r\n\r\n      But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am\r\n      _here!_ To-morrow I shall be fetterless!\xe2\x80\x94_but where?_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF THE FAY\r\n\r\n\r\nNullus enim locus sine genio est.\xe2\x80\x94_Servius_.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cLa musique,\xe2\x80\x9d says Marmontel, in those \xe2\x80\x9cContes Moraux\xe2\x80\x9d (*1) which\r\n      in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling \xe2\x80\x9cMoral\r\n      Tales,\xe2\x80\x9d as if in mockery of their spirit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cla musique est le seul\r\n      des talents qui jouissent de lui-m\xc3\xaame; tous les autres veulent\r\n      des temoins.\xe2\x80\x9d He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet\r\n      sounds with the capacity for creating them. No more than any\r\n      other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete\r\n      enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its\r\n      exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that it\r\n      produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea\r\n      which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or\r\n      has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point,\r\n      is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of\r\n      music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively\r\n      alone. The proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by\r\n      those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual\r\n      uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen\r\n      mortality and perhaps only one\xe2\x80\x94which owes even more than does\r\n      music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the\r\n      happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In\r\n      truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon\r\n      earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the\r\n      presence\xe2\x80\x94not of human life only, but of life in any other form\r\n      than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are\r\n      voiceless\xe2\x80\x94is a stain upon the landscape\xe2\x80\x94is at war with the genius\r\n      of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the\r\n      gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests\r\n      that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains\r\n      that look down upon all,\xe2\x80\x94I love to regard these as themselves but\r\n      the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n      whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and\r\n      most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets;\r\n      whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the\r\n      sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God;\r\n      whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in\r\n      immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own\r\n      cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain\xe2\x80\x94a being\r\n      which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material\r\n      much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.\r\n\r\n      Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on\r\n      every hand\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the\r\n      priesthood\xe2\x80\x94that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important\r\n      consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which\r\n      the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without\r\n      collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms\r\n      of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface,\r\n      to include the greatest possible amount of matter;\xe2\x80\x94while the\r\n      surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser\r\n      population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces\r\n      otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an\r\n      object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be\r\n      an infinity of matter to fill it. And since we see clearly that\r\n      the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle\xe2\x80\x94indeed, as\r\n      far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the\r\n      operations of Deity,\xe2\x80\x94it is scarcely logical to imagine it\r\n      confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it,\r\n      and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within\r\n      cycle without end,\xe2\x80\x94yet all revolving around one far-distant\r\n      centre which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in\r\n      the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater,\r\n      and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring,\r\n      through self-esteem, in believing man, in either his temporal or\r\n      future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that\r\n      vast \xe2\x80\x9cclod of the valley\xe2\x80\x9d which he tills and contemns, and to\r\n      which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he\r\n      does not behold it in operation. (*2)\r\n\r\n      These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my\r\n      meditations among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers\r\n      and the ocean, a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail\r\n      to term fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes have been many,\r\n      and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with\r\n      which I have strayed through many a dim, deep valley, or gazed\r\n      into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been an\r\n      interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and\r\n      gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion\r\n      to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, \xe2\x80\x9cla solitude est une\r\n      belle chose; mais il faut quelqu\xe2\x80\x99un pour vous dire que la\r\n      solitude est une belle chose?\xe2\x80\x9d The epigram cannot be gainsayed;\r\n      but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.\r\n\r\n      It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant\r\n      region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and\r\n      melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all\xe2\x80\x94that I chanced\r\n      upon a certain rivulet and island. I came upon them suddenly in\r\n      the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the\r\n      branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I\r\n      contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look upon\r\n      it\xe2\x80\x94such was the character of phantasm which it wore.\r\n\r\n      On all sides\xe2\x80\x94save to the west, where the sun was about\r\n      sinking\xe2\x80\x94arose the verdant walls of the forest. The little river\r\n      which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost\r\n      to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be\r\n      absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east\xe2\x80\x94while\r\n      in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length\r\n      and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and\r\n      continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall\r\n      from the sunset fountains of the sky.\r\n\r\n      About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in,\r\n      one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the\r\n      bosom of the stream.\r\n\r\n      So blended bank and shadow there\r\n      That each seemed pendulous in air\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely\r\n      possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf\r\n      its crystal dominion began.\r\n\r\n      My position enabled me to include in a single view both the\r\n      eastern and western extremities of the islet; and I observed a\r\n      singularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all\r\n      one radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed\r\n      beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with\r\n      flowers. The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and\r\n      asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful,\r\n      erect\xe2\x80\x94bright, slender, and graceful,\xe2\x80\x94of Eastern figure and\r\n      foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There\r\n      seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no\r\n      airs blew from out the heavens, yet every thing had motion\r\n      through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable\r\n      butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.\r\n      (*4)\r\n\r\n      The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest\r\n      shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded\r\n      all things. The trees were dark in color, and mournful in form\r\n      and attitude, wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral\r\n      shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.\r\n      The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its\r\n      blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many\r\n      small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that\r\n      had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all\r\n      about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade of the\r\n      trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself\r\n      therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I\r\n      fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower,\r\n      separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and\r\n      thus became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued\r\n      momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors\r\n      thus entombed.\r\n\r\n      This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it,\r\n      and I lost myself forthwith in revery. \xe2\x80\x9cIf ever island were\r\n      enchanted,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is it. This is the haunt of\r\n      the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race. Are\r\n      these green tombs theirs?\xe2\x80\x94or do they yield up their sweet lives\r\n      as mankind yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste\r\n      away mournfully, rendering unto God, little by little, their\r\n      existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,\r\n      exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting\r\n      tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker\r\n      by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the\r\n      death which engulfs it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly\r\n      to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the\r\n      island, bearing upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of\r\n      the bark of the sycamore\xe2\x80\x94flakes which, in their multiform\r\n      positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have\r\n      converted into anything it pleased\xe2\x80\x94while I thus mused, it\r\n      appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom\r\n      I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from\r\n      out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect\r\n      in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom\r\n      of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams,\r\n      her attitude seemed indicative of joy\xe2\x80\x94but sorrow deformed it as\r\n      she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at\r\n      length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\n      revolution which has just been made by the Fay,\xe2\x80\x9d continued I,\r\n      musingly, \xe2\x80\x9cis the cycle of the brief year of her life. She has\r\n      floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a year\r\n      nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came\r\n      into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in\r\n      the dark water, making its blackness more black.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      And again the boat appeared and the Fay; but about the attitude\r\n      of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of\r\n      elastic joy. She floated again from out the light and into the\r\n      gloom (which deepened momently) and again her shadow fell from\r\n      her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness.\r\n      And again and again she made the circuit of the island, (while\r\n      the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into\r\n      the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew\r\n      feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage\r\n      into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became\r\n      whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had\r\n      utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self,\r\n      went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony\r\n      flood\xe2\x80\x94and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for\r\n      darkness fell over all things and I beheld her magical figure no\r\n      more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSIGNATION\r\n\r\n\r\n     Stay for me there! I will not fail.\r\n     To meet thee in that hollow vale.\r\n\r\n(_Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King, Bishop of\r\nChichester_.)\r\n\r\n      Ill-fated and mysterious man!\xe2\x80\x94bewildered in the brilliancy of\r\n      thine own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own\r\n      youth!

Once more thy form hath\r\n      risen before me!\xe2\x80\x94not\xe2\x80\x94oh! not as thou art\xe2\x80\x94in the cold valley and\r\n      shadow\xe2\x80\x94but as thou _shouldst be_\xe2\x80\x94squandering away a life of\r\n      magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own\r\n      Venice\xe2\x80\x94which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide\r\n      windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and\r\n      bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I\r\n      repeat it\xe2\x80\x94as thou _shouldst be_. There are surely other worlds\r\n      than this\xe2\x80\x94other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude\xe2\x80\x94other\r\n      speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall\r\n      call thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary\r\n      hours, or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life,\r\n      which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies?\r\n\r\n      It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the\r\n      _Ponte di Sospiri_, that I met for the third or fourth time the\r\n      person of whom I speak. It is with a confused recollection that I\r\n      bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I\r\n      remember\xe2\x80\x94ah! how should I forget?\xe2\x80\x94the deep midnight, the Bridge\r\n      of Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of Romance that\r\n      stalked up and down the narrow canal.\r\n\r\n      It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza\r\n      had sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of\r\n      the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old\r\n      Ducal Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the\r\n      Piazetta, by way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived\r\n      opposite the mouth of the canal San Marco, a female voice from\r\n      its recesses broke suddenly upon the night, in one wild,\r\n      hysterical, and long continued shriek. Startled at the sound, I\r\n      sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting slip his single\r\n      oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery,\r\n      and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current\r\n      which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel. Like\r\n      some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting\r\n      down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux\r\n      flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal\r\n      Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and\r\n      preternatural day.\r\n\r\n      A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen\r\n      from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim\r\n      canal. The quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim;\r\n      and, although my own gondola was the only one in sight, many a\r\n      stout swimmer, already in the stream, was seeking in vain upon\r\n      the surface, the treasure which was to be found, alas! only\r\n      within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the\r\n      entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water, stood a\r\n      figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten. It\r\n      was the Marchesa Aphrodite\xe2\x80\x94the adoration of all Venice\xe2\x80\x94the gayest\r\n      of the gay\xe2\x80\x94the most lovely where all were beautiful\xe2\x80\x94but still the\r\n      young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni, and the mother of\r\n      that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deep beneath\r\n      the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her\r\n      sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to\r\n      call upon her name.\r\n\r\n      She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the\r\n      black mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more\r\n      than half loosened for the night from its ball-room array,\r\n      clustered, amid a shower of diamonds, round and round her\r\n      classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth. A\r\n      snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole\r\n      covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer and midnight\r\n      air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like\r\n      form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor\r\n      which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.\r\n      Yet\xe2\x80\x94strange to say!\xe2\x80\x94her large lustrous eyes were not turned\r\n      downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay\r\n      buried\xe2\x80\x94but riveted in a widely different direction! The prison of\r\n      the Old Republic is, I think, the stateliest building in all\r\n      Venice\xe2\x80\x94but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it, when\r\n      beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark, gloomy niche,\r\n      too, yawns right opposite her chamber window\xe2\x80\x94what, then, _could_\r\n      there be in its shadows\xe2\x80\x94in its architecture\xe2\x80\x94in its ivy-wreathed\r\n      and solemn cornices\xe2\x80\x94that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not wondered\r\n      at a thousand times before? Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x94Who does not remember that,\r\n      at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,\r\n      multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable\r\n      far-off places, the woe which is close at hand?\r\n\r\n      Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the\r\n      water-gate, stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of\r\n      Mentoni himself. He was occasionally occupied in thrumming a\r\n      guitar, and seemed _ennuye_ to the very death, as at intervals he\r\n      gave directions for the recovery of his child. Stupefied and\r\n      aghast, I had myself no power to move from the upright position I\r\n      had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must have\r\n      presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and\r\n      ominous appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I\r\n      floated down among them in that funereal gondola.\r\n\r\n      All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the\r\n      search were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy\r\n      sorrow. There seemed but little hope for the child; (how much\r\n      less than for the mother!) but now, from the interior of that\r\n      dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of\r\n      the Old Republican prison, and as fronting the lattice of the\r\n      Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak, stepped out within reach\r\n      of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy\r\n      descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an instant\r\n      afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing child\r\n      within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the\r\n      Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became\r\n      unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to\r\n      the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very\r\n      young man, with the sound of whose name the greater part of\r\n      Europe was then ringing.\r\n\r\n      No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now\r\n      receive her child\xe2\x80\x94she will press it to her heart\xe2\x80\x94she will cling\r\n      to its little form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas!\r\n      _another\xe2\x80\x99s_ arms have taken it from the stranger\xe2\x80\x94_another\xe2\x80\x99s_ arms\r\n      have taken it away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the\r\n      palace! And the Marchesa! Her lip\xe2\x80\x94her beautiful lip trembles;\r\n      tears are gathering in her eyes\xe2\x80\x94those eyes which, like Pliny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      acanthus, are \xe2\x80\x9csoft and almost liquid.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes! tears are gathering\r\n      in those eyes\xe2\x80\x94and see! the entire woman thrills throughout the\r\n      soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor of the\r\n      marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very\r\n      purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a\r\n      tide of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about\r\n      her delicate frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich\r\n      silver lilies in the grass.\r\n\r\n      Why _should_ that lady blush! To this demand there is no\r\n      answer\xe2\x80\x94except that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of\r\n      a mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart, the privacy of her own _boudoir_, she has\r\n      neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers, and utterly\r\n      forgotten to throw over her Venetian shoulders that drapery which\r\n      is their due. What other possible reason could there have been\r\n      for her so blushing?\xe2\x80\x94for the glance of those wild appealing\r\n      eyes?\xe2\x80\x94for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\n      convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?\xe2\x80\x94that hand which fell,\r\n      as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of\r\n      the stranger. What reason could there have been for the low\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady\r\n      uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu? \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast conquered,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      she said, or the murmurs of the water deceived me; \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast\r\n      conquered\xe2\x80\x94one hour after sunrise\xe2\x80\x94we shall meet\xe2\x80\x94so let it be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the\r\n      palace, and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon\r\n      the flags. He shook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye\r\n      glanced around in search of a gondola. I could not do less than\r\n      offer him the service of my own; and he accepted the civility.\r\n      Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we proceeded together\r\n      to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his self-possession,\r\n      and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great\r\n      apparent cordiality.\r\n\r\n      There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being\r\n      minute. The person of the stranger\xe2\x80\x94let me call him by this title,\r\n      who to all the world was still a stranger\xe2\x80\x94the person of the\r\n      stranger is one of these subjects. In height he might have been\r\n      below rather than above the medium size: although there were\r\n      moments of intense passion when his frame actually _expanded_ and\r\n      belied the assertion. The light, almost slender symmetry of his\r\n      figure, promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at\r\n      the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which he has\r\n      been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more\r\n      dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity\xe2\x80\x94singular,\r\n      wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to\r\n      intense and brilliant jet\xe2\x80\x94and a profusion of curling, black hair,\r\n      from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at\r\n      intervals all light and ivory\xe2\x80\x94his were features than which I have\r\n      seen none more classically regular, except, perhaps, the marble\r\n      ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet his countenance was,\r\n      nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen at some period\r\n      of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It had no\r\n      peculiar, it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened\r\n      upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten, but\r\n      forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it\r\n      to mind. Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any\r\n      time, to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that\r\n      face\xe2\x80\x94but that the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the\r\n      passion, when the passion had departed.\r\n\r\n      Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me,\r\n      in what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him _very_ early\r\n      the next morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself\r\n      accordingly at his Palazzo, one of those huge structures of\r\n      gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower above the waters of the\r\n      Grand Canal in the vicinity of the Rialto. I was shown up a broad\r\n      winding staircase of mosaics, into an apartment whose\r\n      unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an\r\n      actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.\r\n\r\n      I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his\r\n      possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of\r\n      ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not\r\n      bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe\r\n      could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and\r\n      blazed around.\r\n\r\n      Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still\r\n      brilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well\r\n      as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend,\r\n      that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding\r\n      night. In the architecture and embellishments of the chamber, the\r\n      evident design had been to dazzle and astound. Little attention\r\n      had been paid to the _decora_ of what is technically called\r\n      _keeping_, or to the proprieties of nationality. The eye wandered\r\n      from object to object, and rested upon none\xe2\x80\x94neither the\r\n      _grotesques_ of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures of the\r\n      best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich\r\n      draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of\r\n      low, melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The\r\n      senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes,\r\n      reeking up from strange convolute censers, together with\r\n      multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and\r\n      violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the\r\n      whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane of\r\n      crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand\r\n      reflections, from curtains which rolled from their cornices like\r\n      cataracts of molten silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at\r\n      length fitfully with the artificial light, and lay weltering in\r\n      subdued masses upon a carpet of rich, liquid-looking cloth of\r\n      Chili gold.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94laughed the proprietor, motioning me to\r\n      a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at\r\n      full-length upon an ottoman. \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, perceiving that I\r\n      could not immediately reconcile myself to the _bienseance_ of so\r\n      singular a welcome\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI see you are astonished at my apartment\xe2\x80\x94at\r\n      my statues\xe2\x80\x94my pictures\xe2\x80\x94my originality of conception in\r\n      architecture and upholstery! absolutely drunk, eh, with my\r\n      magnificence? But pardon me, my dear sir, (here his tone of voice\r\n      dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,) pardon me for my\r\n      uncharitable laughter. You appeared so _utterly_ astonished.\r\n      Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a man\r\n      _must_ laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious\r\n      of all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More\xe2\x80\x94a very fine man was Sir\r\n      Thomas More\xe2\x80\x94Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in\r\n      the _Absurdities_ of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of\r\n      characters who came to the same magnificent end. Do you know,\r\n      however,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he musingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat at Sparta (which is now\r\n      Pal\xc3\xa6ochori,) at Sparta, I say, to the west of the citadel, among\r\n      a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is a kind of _socle_, upon\r\n      which are still legible the letters \xce\x9b\xce\x91\xce\x9e\xce\x9c. They are undoubtedly\r\n      part of \xce\x93\xce\x95\xce\x9b\xce\x91\xce\x9e\xce\x9c\xce\x91. Now, at Sparta were a thousand temples and\r\n      shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly\r\n      strange that the altar of Laughter should have survived all the\r\n      others! But in the present instance,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, with a singular\r\n      alteration of voice and manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no right to be merry at\r\n      your expense. You might well have been amazed. Europe cannot\r\n      produce anything so fine as this, my little regal cabinet. My\r\n      other apartments are by no means of the same order\xe2\x80\x94mere _ultras_\r\n      of fashionable insipidity. This is better than fashion\xe2\x80\x94is it not?\r\n      Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage\xe2\x80\x94that is, with\r\n      those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony.\r\n      I have guarded, however, against any such profanation. With one\r\n      exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my\r\n      _valet_, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these\r\n      imperial precincts, since they have been bedizened as you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I bowed in acknowledgment\xe2\x80\x94for the overpowering sense of splendor\r\n      and perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity\r\n      of his address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in\r\n      words, my appreciation of what I might have construed into a\r\n      compliment.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered\r\n      around the apartment, \xe2\x80\x9chere are paintings from the Greeks to\r\n      Cimabue, and from Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen,\r\n      as you see, with little deference to the opinions of Virtu. They\r\n      are all, however, fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this.\r\n      Here, too, are some _chefs d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvre_ of the unknown great; and\r\n      here, unfinished designs by men, celebrated in their day, whose\r\n      very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence\r\n      and to me. What think you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning abruptly as he\r\n      spoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat think you of this Madonna della Pieta?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Guido\xe2\x80\x99s own!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with all the enthusiasm of my\r\n      nature, for I had been poring intently over its surpassing\r\n      loveliness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Guido\xe2\x80\x99s own!\xe2\x80\x94how _could_ you have obtained\r\n      it?\xe2\x80\x94she is undoubtedly in painting what the Venus is in\r\n      sculpture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Venus\xe2\x80\x94the beautiful Venus?\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      Venus of the Medici?\xe2\x80\x94she of the diminutive head and the gilded\r\n      hair? Part of the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be\r\n      heard with difficulty,) and all the right, are restorations; and\r\n      in the coquetry of that right arm lies, I think, the quintessence\r\n      of all affectation. Give _me_ the Canova! The Apollo, too, is a\r\n      copy\xe2\x80\x94there can be no doubt of it\xe2\x80\x94blind fool that I am, who cannot\r\n      behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo! I cannot help\xe2\x80\x94pity\r\n      me!\xe2\x80\x94I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was it not Socrates\r\n      who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of\r\n      marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his\r\n      couplet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Non ha l\xe2\x80\x99ottimo artista alcun concetto\r\n     Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the\r\n      true gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the\r\n      bearing of the vulgar, without being at once precisely able to\r\n      determine in what such difference consists. Allowing the remark\r\n      to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my\r\n      acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful morning, still more\r\n      fully applicable to his moral temperament and character. Nor can\r\n      I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place\r\n      him so essentially apart from all other human beings, than by\r\n      calling it a _habit_ of intense and continual thought, pervading\r\n      even his most trivial actions\xe2\x80\x94intruding upon his moments of\r\n      dalliance\xe2\x80\x94and interweaving itself with his very flashes of\r\n      merriment\xe2\x80\x94like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the\r\n      grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.\r\n\r\n      I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the\r\n      mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly\r\n      descanted upon matters of little importance, a certain air of\r\n      trepidation\xe2\x80\x94a degree of nervous _unction_ in action and in\r\n      speech\xe2\x80\x94an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at\r\n      all times unaccountable, and upon some occasions even filled me\r\n      with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the middle of a sentence\r\n      whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he seemed to be\r\n      listening in the deepest attention, as if either in momentary\r\n      expectation of a visitor, or to sounds which must have had\r\n      existence in his imagination alone.\r\n\r\n      It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent\r\n      abstraction, that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar\r\n      Politian\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful tragedy \xe2\x80\x9cThe Orfeo,\xe2\x80\x9d (the first native\r\n      Italian tragedy,) which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered\r\n      a passage underlined in pencil. It was a passage towards the end\r\n      of the third act\xe2\x80\x94a passage of the most heart-stirring\r\n      excitement\xe2\x80\x94a passage which, although tainted with impurity, no\r\n      man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion\xe2\x80\x94no woman without\r\n      a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and, upon\r\n      the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines, written\r\n      in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my\r\n      acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his\r\n      own:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThou wast that all to me, love,\r\n    For which my soul did pine\xe2\x80\x94\r\nA green isle in the sea, love,\r\n    A fountain and a shrine,\r\nAll wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;\r\n    And all the flowers were mine.\r\n\r\nAh, dream too bright to last!\r\n    Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise\r\nBut to be overcast!\r\n    A voice from out the Future cries,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnward!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but o\xe2\x80\x99er the Past\r\n    (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,\r\nMute\xe2\x80\x94motionless\xe2\x80\x94aghast!\r\n\r\nFor alas!  alas!  with me\r\n    The light of life is o\xe2\x80\x99er.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more\xe2\x80\x94no more\xe2\x80\x94no more,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    (Such language holds the solemn sea\r\nTo the sands upon the shore,)\r\n    Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,\r\nOr the stricken eagle soar!\r\n\r\nNow all my hours are trances;\r\n    And all my nightly dreams\r\nAre where the dark eye glances,\r\n    And where thy footstep gleams,\r\nIn what ethereal dances,\r\n    By what Italian streams.\r\n\r\nAlas!  for that accursed time\r\n    They bore thee o\xe2\x80\x99er the billow,\r\nFrom Love to titled age and crime,\r\n    And an unholy pillow!\xe2\x80\x94\r\nFrom me, and from our misty clime,\r\n    Where weeps the silver willow!\r\n\r\n      That these lines were written in English\xe2\x80\x94a language with which I\r\n      had not believed their author acquainted\xe2\x80\x94afforded me little\r\n      matter for surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his\r\n      acquirements, and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing\r\n      them from observation, to be astonished at any similar discovery;\r\n      but the place of date, I must confess, occasioned me no little\r\n      amazement. It had been originally written _London_, and\r\n      afterwards carefully overscored\xe2\x80\x94not, however, so effectually as\r\n      to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this\r\n      occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a\r\n      former conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he\r\n      had at any time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for\r\n      some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city,)\r\n      when his answer, if I mistake not, gave me to understand that he\r\n      had never visited the metropolis of Great Britain. I might as\r\n      well here mention, that I have more than once heard, (without, of\r\n      course, giving credit to a report involving so many\r\n      improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was not only\r\n      by birth, but in education, an _Englishman_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one painting,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, without being aware of my notice of\r\nthe tragedy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere is still one painting which you have not seen.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthrowing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of the\r\nMarchesa Aphrodite.\r\n\r\nHuman art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman\r\nbeauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding\r\nnight upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once again.\r\nBut in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all over\r\nwith smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful\r\nstain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the\r\nperfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.\r\nWith her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase. One\r\nsmall, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and,\r\nscarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to\r\nencircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most\r\ndelicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the\r\nfigure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s _Bussy\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Ambois_, quivered instinctively upon my lips:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHe is up\r\nThere like a Roman statue!  He will stand\r\nTill Death hath made him marble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length, turning towards a table of richly\r\n      enamelled and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets\r\n      fantastically stained, together with two large Etruscan vases,\r\n      fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the\r\n      foreground of the portrait, and filled with what I supposed to be\r\n      Johannisberger. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9clet us drink! It is\r\n      early\xe2\x80\x94but let us drink. It is _indeed_ early,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\n      musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the\r\n      apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is _indeed_\r\n      early\xe2\x80\x94but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an\r\n      offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers\r\n      are so eager to subdue!\xe2\x80\x9d And, having made me pledge him in a\r\n      bumper, he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the\r\n      wine.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo dream,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory\r\n      conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of\r\n      the magnificent vases\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto dream has been the business of my life.\r\n      I have therefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of\r\n      dreams. In the heart of Venice could I have erected a better? You\r\n      behold around you, it is true, a medley of architectural\r\n      embellishments. The chastity of Ionia is offended by antediluvian\r\n      devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are outstretched upon carpets\r\n      of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone.\r\n      Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the bugbears\r\n      which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent.\r\n      Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly has\r\n      palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my purpose.\r\n      Like these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and\r\n      the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder\r\n      visions of that land of real dreams whither I am now rapidly\r\n      departing.\xe2\x80\x9d He here paused abruptly, bent his head to his bosom,\r\n      and seemed to listen to a sound which I could not hear. At\r\n      length, erecting his frame, he looked upwards, and ejaculated the\r\n      lines of the Bishop of Chichester:\r\n\r\n     _\xe2\x80\x9cStay for me there!  I will not fail_\r\n     _To meet thee in that hollow vale.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n      In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw\r\n      himself at full-length upon an ottoman.\r\n\r\n      A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock\r\n      at the door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a\r\n      second disturbance, when a page of Mentoni\xe2\x80\x99s household burst into\r\n      the room, and faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the\r\n      incoherent words, \xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress!\xe2\x80\x94my mistress!\xe2\x80\x94Poisoned!\xe2\x80\x94poisoned!\r\n      Oh, beautiful\xe2\x80\x94oh, beautiful Aphrodite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the\r\n      sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs\r\n      were rigid\xe2\x80\x94his lips were livid\xe2\x80\x94his lately beaming eyes were\r\n      riveted in _death_. I staggered back towards the table\xe2\x80\x94my hand\r\n      fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet\xe2\x80\x94and a consciousness of\r\n      the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIT AND THE PENDULUM\r\n\r\n\r\n     Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores\r\n     Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.\r\n     Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,\r\n     Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.\r\n\r\n[_Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the\r\nsite of the Jacobin Club House at Paris_.]\r\n\r\n      I was sick\xe2\x80\x94sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at\r\n      length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my\r\n      senses were leaving me. The sentence\xe2\x80\x94the dread sentence of\r\n      death\xe2\x80\x94was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my\r\n      ears. After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed\r\n      merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul\r\n      the idea of _revolution_\xe2\x80\x94perhaps from its association in fancy\r\n      with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief period, for\r\n      presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw\xe2\x80\x94but with how\r\n      terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed\r\n      judges. They appeared to me white\xe2\x80\x94whiter than the sheet upon\r\n      which I trace these words\xe2\x80\x94and thin even to grotesqueness; thin\r\n      with the intensity of their expression of firmness\xe2\x80\x94of immoveable\r\n      resolution\xe2\x80\x94of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the\r\n      decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those\r\n      lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them\r\n      fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no\r\n      sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious\r\n      horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable\r\n      draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my\r\n      vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first\r\n      they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender\r\n      angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a\r\n      most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my\r\n      frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery,\r\n      while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of\r\n      flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then\r\n      there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought\r\n      of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought came\r\n      gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full\r\n      appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to\r\n      feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if\r\n      magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into\r\n      nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of\r\n      darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a\r\n      mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and\r\n      stillness, night were the universe.\r\n\r\n      I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness\r\n      was lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define,\r\n      or even to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest\r\n      slumber\xe2\x80\x94no! In delirium\xe2\x80\x94no! In a swoon\xe2\x80\x94no! In death\xe2\x80\x94no! even in\r\n      the grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man.\r\n      Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the\r\n      gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a second afterward, (so frail\r\n      may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed. In\r\n      the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first,\r\n      that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the\r\n      sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon\r\n      reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the\r\n      first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of\r\n      the gulf beyond. And that gulf is\xe2\x80\x94what? How at least shall we\r\n      distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the\r\n      impressions of what I have termed the first stage are not, at\r\n      will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come\r\n      unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never\r\n      swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar\r\n      faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in\r\n      mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who\r\n      ponders over the perfume of some novel flower; is not he whose\r\n      brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence\r\n      which has never before arrested his attention.\r\n\r\n      Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest\r\n      struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming\r\n      nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been\r\n      moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief,\r\n      very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the\r\n      lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference\r\n      only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These shadows\r\n      of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and\r\n      bore me in silence down\xe2\x80\x94down\xe2\x80\x94still down\xe2\x80\x94till a hideous dizziness\r\n      oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the\r\n      descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account\r\n      of that heart\xe2\x80\x99s unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden\r\n      motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a\r\n      ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the\r\n      limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After\r\n      this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is\r\n      madness\xe2\x80\x94the madness of a memory which busies itself among\r\n      forbidden things.\r\n\r\n      Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its\r\n      beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound,\r\n      and motion, and touch\xe2\x80\x94a tingling sensation pervading my frame.\r\n      Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n      condition which lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and\r\n      shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true\r\n      state. Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility. Then a\r\n      rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move. And now\r\n      a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable\r\n      draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then\r\n      entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later\r\n      day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to\r\n      recall.\r\n\r\n      So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,\r\n      unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon\r\n      something damp and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many\r\n      minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be. I\r\n      longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I dreaded the first\r\n      glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to look\r\n      upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be\r\n      nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I\r\n      quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were\r\n      confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I\r\n      struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to\r\n      oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I\r\n      still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I\r\n      brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from\r\n      that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed;\r\n      and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since\r\n      elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead.\r\n      Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is\r\n      altogether inconsistent with real existence;\xe2\x80\x94but where and in\r\n      what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished\r\n      usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the\r\n      very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my\r\n      dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place\r\n      for many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had\r\n      been in immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all\r\n      the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was\r\n      not altogether excluded.\r\n\r\n      A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my\r\n      heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into\r\n      insensibility. Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet,\r\n      trembling convulsively in every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly\r\n      above and around me in all directions. I felt nothing; yet\r\n      dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of\r\n      a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big\r\n      beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew at length\r\n      intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms\r\n      extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope\r\n      of catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces;\r\n      but still all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely.\r\n      It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous\r\n      of fates.\r\n\r\n      And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there\r\n      came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of\r\n      the horrors of Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange\r\n      things narrated\xe2\x80\x94fables I had always deemed them\xe2\x80\x94but yet strange,\r\n      and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. Was I left to\r\n      perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or\r\n      what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me? That the result\r\n      would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I\r\n      knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode and\r\n      the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.\r\n\r\n      My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid\r\n      obstruction. It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry\xe2\x80\x94very\r\n      smooth, slimy, and cold. I followed it up; stepping with all the\r\n      careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had\r\n      inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no means of\r\n      ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its\r\n      circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being\r\n      aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I\r\n      therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led\r\n      into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had\r\n      been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of\r\n      forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to\r\n      identify my point of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was\r\n      but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at\r\n      first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and\r\n      placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the\r\n      wall. In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to\r\n      encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at least I\r\n      thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or\r\n      upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I\r\n      staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My\r\n      excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon\r\n      overtook me as I lay.\r\n\r\n      Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a\r\n      loaf and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to\r\n      reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity.\r\n      Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with\r\n      much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge. Up to the\r\n      period when I fell I had counted fifty-two paces, and upon\r\n      resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight more\xe2\x80\x94when I arrived\r\n      at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and,\r\n      admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be\r\n      fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in\r\n      the wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the\r\n      vault, for vault I could not help supposing it to be.\r\n\r\n      I had little object\xe2\x80\x94certainly no hope\xe2\x80\x94in these researches; but a\r\n      vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall,\r\n      I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I\r\n      proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly\r\n      of solid material, was treacherous with slime. At length,\r\n      however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly;\r\n      endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible. I had\r\n      advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the\r\n      remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my\r\n      legs. I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.\r\n\r\n      In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately\r\n      apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few\r\n      seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my\r\n      attention. It was this: my chin rested upon the floor of the\r\n      prison, but my lips and the upper portion of my head, although\r\n      seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing. At\r\n      the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and\r\n      the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I put\r\n      forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the\r\n      very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no\r\n      means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry\r\n      just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small\r\n      fragment, and let it fall into the abyss. For many seconds I\r\n      hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of\r\n      the chasm in its descent; at length there was a sullen plunge\r\n      into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment there\r\n      came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing\r\n      of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly\r\n      through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.\r\n\r\n      I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and\r\n      congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had\r\n      escaped. Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me\r\n      no more. And the death just avoided, was of that very character\r\n      which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales\r\n      respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its tyranny, there\r\n      was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or\r\n      death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved\r\n      for the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung,\r\n      until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in\r\n      every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which\r\n      awaited me.\r\n\r\n      Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall\xe2\x80\x94resolving\r\n      there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of\r\n      which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about\r\n      the dungeon. In other conditions of mind I might have had courage\r\n      to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses;\r\n      but now I was the veriest of cowards. Neither could I forget what\r\n      I had read of these pits\xe2\x80\x94that the sudden extinction of life\r\n      formed no part of their most horrible plan.\r\n\r\n      Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours, but at\r\n      length I again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as\r\n      before, a loaf and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed\r\n      me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught. It must have been\r\n      drugged\xe2\x80\x94for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly\r\n      drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me\xe2\x80\x94a sleep like that of death. How\r\n      long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once again, I\r\n      unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild\r\n      sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first\r\n      determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the\r\n      prison.\r\n\r\n      In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its\r\n      walls did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this\r\n      fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what\r\n      could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances\r\n      which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But\r\n      my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in\r\n      endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my\r\n      measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my first\r\n      attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the\r\n      period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of\r\n      the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the\r\n      circuit of the vault. I then slept\xe2\x80\x94and, upon awaking, I must have\r\n      returned upon my steps\xe2\x80\x94thus supposing the circuit nearly double\r\n      what it actually was. My confusion of mind prevented me from\r\n      observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and\r\n      ended it with the wall to the right.\r\n\r\n      I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the\r\n      enclosure. In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus\r\n      deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of\r\n      total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep! The\r\n      angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches,\r\n      at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison was square.\r\n      What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other\r\n      metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the\r\n      depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was\r\n      rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which\r\n      the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures\r\n      of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other\r\n      more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls.\r\n      I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were\r\n      sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and\r\n      blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now\r\n      noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In the centre yawned\r\n      the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the\r\n      only one in the dungeon.\r\n\r\n      All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort\xe2\x80\x94for my personal\r\n      condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon\r\n      my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of\r\n      wood. To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a\r\n      surcingle. It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and\r\n      body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such\r\n      extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with\r\n      food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I\r\n      saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my\r\n      horror\xe2\x80\x94for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst it\r\n      appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\n      food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.\r\n\r\n      Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some\r\n      thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side\r\n      walls. In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my\r\n      whole attention. It was the painted figure of Time as he is\r\n      commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held\r\n      what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of\r\n      a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There was\r\n      something, however, in the appearance of this machine which\r\n      caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly\r\n      upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I\r\n      fancied that I saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the\r\n      fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. I\r\n      watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in\r\n      wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I\r\n      turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.\r\n\r\n      A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I\r\n      saw several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the\r\n      well, which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I\r\n      gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes,\r\n      allured by the scent of the meat. From this it required much\r\n      effort and attention to scare them away.\r\n\r\n      It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I\r\n      could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my\r\n      eyes upward. What I then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep\r\n      of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a\r\n      natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater. But what\r\n      mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended.\r\n      I now observed\xe2\x80\x94with what horror it is needless to say\xe2\x80\x94that its\r\n      nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel,\r\n      about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and\r\n      the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like a razor\r\n      also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a\r\n      solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod\r\n      of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.\r\n\r\n      I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish\r\n      ingenuity in torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known\r\n      to the inquisitorial agents\xe2\x80\x94_the pit_, whose horrors had been\r\n      destined for so bold a recusant as myself\xe2\x80\x94the pit, typical of\r\n      hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their\r\n      punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest\r\n      of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment,\r\n      formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these\r\n      dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the\r\n      demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no\r\n      alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me.\r\n      Milder! I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such\r\n      application of such a term.\r\n\r\n      What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than\r\n      mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the\r\n      steel! Inch by inch\xe2\x80\x94line by line\xe2\x80\x94with a descent only appreciable\r\n      at intervals that seemed ages\xe2\x80\x94down and still down it came! Days\r\n      passed\xe2\x80\x94it might have been that many days passed\xe2\x80\x94ere it swept so\r\n      closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath. The odor of\r\n      the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils. I prayed\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent. I grew\r\n      frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the\r\n      sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly calm, and\r\n      lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare\r\n      bauble.\r\n\r\n      There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief;\r\n      for, upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible\r\n      descent in the pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew\r\n      there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have\r\n      arrested the vibration at pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt\r\n      very\xe2\x80\x94oh! inexpressibly\xe2\x80\x94sick and weak, as if through long\r\n      inanition. Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature\r\n      craved food. With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as\r\n      far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small\r\n      remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion\r\n      of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed\r\n      thought of joy\xe2\x80\x94of hope. Yet what business had _I_ with hope? It\r\n      was, as I say, a half formed thought\xe2\x80\x94man has many such, which are\r\n      never completed. I felt that it was of joy\xe2\x80\x94of hope; but felt also\r\n      that it had perished in its formation. In vain I struggled to\r\n      perfect\xe2\x80\x94to regain it. Long suffering had nearly annihilated all\r\n      my ordinary powers of mind. I was an imbecile\xe2\x80\x94an idiot.\r\n\r\n      The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I\r\n      saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the\r\n      heart. It would fray the serge of my robe\xe2\x80\x94it would return and\r\n      repeat its operations\xe2\x80\x94again\xe2\x80\x94and again. Notwithstanding its\r\n      terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the\r\n      hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very\r\n      walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that,\r\n      for several minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I\r\n      paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon\r\n      it with a pertinacity of attention\xe2\x80\x94as if, in so dwelling, I could\r\n      arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to ponder\r\n      upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the\r\n      garment\xe2\x80\x94upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction\r\n      of cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this\r\n      frivolity until my teeth were on edge.\r\n\r\n      Down\xe2\x80\x94steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in\r\n      contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the\r\n      right\xe2\x80\x94to the left\xe2\x80\x94far and wide\xe2\x80\x94with the shriek of a damned\r\n      spirit! to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I\r\n      alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew\r\n      predominant.\r\n\r\n      Down\xe2\x80\x94certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three\r\n      inches of my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my\r\n      left arm. This was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could\r\n      reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with\r\n      great effort, but no farther. Could I have broken the fastenings\r\n      above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the\r\n      pendulum. I might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche!\r\n\r\n      Down\xe2\x80\x94still unceasingly\xe2\x80\x94still inevitably down! I gasped and\r\n      struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every\r\n      sweep. My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the\r\n      eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves\r\n      spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a\r\n      relief, oh, how unspeakable! Still I quivered in every nerve to\r\n      think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate\r\n      that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope that\r\n      prompted the nerve to quiver\xe2\x80\x94the frame to shrink. It was hope\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      hope that triumphs on the rack\xe2\x80\x94that whispers to the\r\n      death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n      I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in\r\n      actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there\r\n      suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of\r\n      despair. For the first time during many hours\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps days\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      thought. It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle,\r\n      which enveloped me, was unique. I was tied by no separate cord.\r\n      The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of\r\n      the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my\r\n      person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that case,\r\n      the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle\r\n      how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the\r\n      torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility? Was\r\n      it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the\r\n      pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last\r\n      hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a\r\n      distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my limbs and\r\n      body close in all directions\xe2\x80\x94save in the path of the destroying\r\n      crescent.\r\n\r\n      Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position,\r\n      when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe\r\n      than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I\r\n      have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated\r\n      indeterminately through my brain when I raised food to my burning\r\n      lips. The whole thought was now present\xe2\x80\x94feeble, scarcely sane,\r\n      scarcely definite,\xe2\x80\x94but still entire. I proceeded at once, with\r\n      the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.\r\n\r\n      For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon\r\n      which I lay had been literally swarming with rats. They were\r\n      wild, bold, ravenous\xe2\x80\x94their red eyes glaring upon me as if they\r\n      waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cTo what food,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9chave they been accustomed in the\r\n      well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them,\r\n      all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen\r\n      into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter;\r\n      and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement\r\n      deprived it of effect. In their voracity the vermin frequently\r\n      fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers. With the particles of\r\n      the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed\r\n      the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from\r\n      the floor, I lay breathlessly still.\r\n\r\n      At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the\r\n      change\xe2\x80\x94at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back;\r\n      many sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not\r\n      counted in vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained\r\n      without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the\r\n      frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This seemed the signal\r\n      for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in fresh\r\n      troops. They clung to the wood\xe2\x80\x94they overran it, and leaped in\r\n      hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum\r\n      disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied\r\n      themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed\xe2\x80\x94they swarmed\r\n      upon me in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat;\r\n      their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their\r\n      thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name,\r\n      swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart.\r\n      Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over.\r\n      Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in\r\n      more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than\r\n      human resolution I lay still.\r\n\r\n      Nor had I erred in my calculations\xe2\x80\x94nor had I endured in vain. I\r\n      at length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands\r\n      from my body. But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon\r\n      my bosom. It had divided the serge of the robe. It had cut\r\n      through the linen beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp\r\n      sense of pain shot through every nerve. But the moment of escape\r\n      had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried\r\n      tumultuously away. With a steady movement\xe2\x80\x94cautious, sidelong,\r\n      shrinking, and slow\xe2\x80\x94I slid from the embrace of the bandage and\r\n      beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was\r\n      free.\r\n\r\n      Free!\xe2\x80\x94and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped\r\n      from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison,\r\n      when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it\r\n      drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. This was\r\n      a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was\r\n      undoubtedly watched. Free!\xe2\x80\x94I had but escaped death in one form of\r\n      agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. With\r\n      that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of\r\n      iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual\xe2\x80\x94some change which, at\r\n      first, I could not appreciate distinctly\xe2\x80\x94it was obvious, had\r\n      taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and\r\n      trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected\r\n      conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first\r\n      time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the\r\n      cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,\r\n      extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls,\r\n      which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the\r\n      floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the\r\n      aperture.\r\n\r\n      As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the\r\n      chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed\r\n      that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were\r\n      sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and\r\n      indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily\r\n      assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to\r\n      the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have\r\n      thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild\r\n      and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions,\r\n      where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid\r\n      lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard\r\n      as unreal.\r\n\r\n      _Unreal!_\xe2\x80\x94Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the\r\n      breath of the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded\r\n      the prison! A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that\r\n      glared at my agonies! A richer tint of crimson diffused itself\r\n      over the pictured horrors of blood. I panted! I gasped for\r\n      breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my\r\n      tormentors\xe2\x80\x94oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I\r\n      shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the\r\n      thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the\r\n      coolness of the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its\r\n      deadly brink. I threw my straining vision below. The glare from\r\n      the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild\r\n      moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I\r\n      saw. At length it forced\xe2\x80\x94it wrestled its way into my soul\xe2\x80\x94it\r\n      burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. Oh! for a voice to\r\n      speak!\xe2\x80\x94oh! horror!\xe2\x80\x94oh! any horror but this! With a shriek, I\r\n      rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands\xe2\x80\x94weeping\r\n      bitterly.\r\n\r\n      The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up,\r\n      shuddering as with a fit of the ague. There had been a second\r\n      change in the cell\xe2\x80\x94and now the change was obviously in the form.\r\n      As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to\r\n      appreciate or understand what was taking place. But not long was\r\n      I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by\r\n      my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the\r\n      King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its\r\n      iron angles were now acute\xe2\x80\x94two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful\r\n      difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning\r\n      sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that\r\n      of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here\xe2\x80\x94I neither hoped\r\n      nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my\r\n      bosom as a garment of eternal peace. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cany death\r\n      but that of the pit!\xe2\x80\x9d Fool! might I have not known that into the\r\n      pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me? Could I\r\n      resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its\r\n      pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a\r\n      rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and\r\n      of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I\r\n      shrank back\xe2\x80\x94but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.\r\n      At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an\r\n      inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no\r\n      more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and\r\n      final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      averted my eyes\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n      There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud\r\n      blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a\r\n      thousand thunders! The fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched\r\n      arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss. It was\r\n      that of General Lasalle. The French army had entered Toledo. The\r\n      Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PREMATURE BURIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n      There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing,\r\n      but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of\r\n      legitimate fiction. These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he\r\n      do not wish to offend or to disgust. They are with propriety\r\n      handled only when the severity and majesty of Truth sanctify and\r\n      sustain them. We thrill, for example, with the most intense of\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cpleasurable pain\xe2\x80\x9d over the accounts of the Passage of the\r\n      Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London,\r\n      of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the\r\n      hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta.\r\n      But in these accounts it is the fact\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94it is the reality\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\n      the history which excites. As inventions, we should regard them\r\n      with simple abhorrence.\r\n\r\n      I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august\r\n      calamities on record; but in these it is the extent, not less\r\n      than the character of the calamity, which so vividly impresses\r\n      the fancy. I need not remind the reader that, from the long and\r\n      weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many\r\n      individual instances more replete with essential suffering than\r\n      any of these vast generalities of disaster. The true\r\n      wretchedness, indeed\xe2\x80\x94the ultimate woe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94is particular, not\r\n      diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man\r\n      the unit, and never by man the mass\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94for this let us thank a\r\n      merciful God!\r\n\r\n      To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific\r\n      of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere\r\n      mortality. That it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen\r\n      will scarcely be denied by those who think. The boundaries which\r\n      divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall\r\n      say where the one ends, and where the other begins? We know that\r\n      there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the\r\n      apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations\r\n      are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only\r\n      temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain\r\n      period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets\r\n      in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver\r\n      cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably\r\n      broken. But where, meantime, was the soul?\r\n\r\n      Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, _a priori_ that\r\n      such causes must produce such effects\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94that the well-known\r\n      occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally\r\n      give rise, now and then, to premature interments\xe2\x80\x94apart from this\r\n      consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and\r\n      ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such\r\n      interments have actually taken place. I might refer at once, if\r\n      necessary, to a hundred well-authenticated instances. One of very\r\n      remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh\r\n      in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago,\r\n      in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a\r\n      painful, intense, and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one\r\n      of the most respectable citizens\xe2\x80\x94a lawyer of eminence and a\r\n      member of Congress\xe2\x80\x94was seized with a sudden and unaccountable\r\n      illness, which completely baffled the skill of her physicians.\r\n      After much suffering she died, or was supposed to die. No one\r\n      suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not\r\n      actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of\r\n      death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The\r\n      lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless.\r\n      There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the\r\n      body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony\r\n      rigidity. The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the\r\n      rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition.\r\n\r\n      The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three\r\n      subsequent years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term\r\n      it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus; but, alas! how\r\n      fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open\r\n      the door! As its portals swung outwardly back, some\r\n      white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms. It was the\r\n      skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.\r\n\r\n      A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived\r\n      within two days after her entombment; that her struggles within\r\n      the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the\r\n      floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape. A lamp\r\n      which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb,\r\n      was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by\r\n      evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which led down into\r\n      the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with which,\r\n      it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by\r\n      striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably\r\n      swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing,\r\n      her shroud became entangled in some iron-work which projected\r\n      interiorly. Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect.\r\n\r\n      In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,\r\n      attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion\r\n      that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the\r\n      story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of\r\n      illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty.\r\n      Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor\r\n      _litterateur_, or journalist of Paris. His talents and general\r\n      amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by\r\n      whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth\r\n      decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur\r\n      Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After\r\n      marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even\r\n      more positively ill-treated her. Having passed with him some\r\n      wretched years, she died\xe2\x80\x94at least her condition so closely\r\n      resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her. She was\r\n      buried\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the village\r\n      of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the\r\n      memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the\r\n      capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with\r\n      the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing\r\n      himself of its luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At\r\n      midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of\r\n      detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the\r\n      beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried alive. Vitality\r\n      had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses\r\n      of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death.\r\n      He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He\r\n      employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little\r\n      medical learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her\r\n      preserver. She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she\r\n      fully recovered her original health. Her woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart was not\r\n      adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She\r\n      bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband,\r\n      but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to\r\n      America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in\r\n      the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her.\r\n      They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur\r\n      Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife. This\r\n      claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her\r\n      resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the\r\n      long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but\r\n      legally, the authority of the husband.\r\n\r\n      The \xe2\x80\x9cChirurgical Journal\xe2\x80\x9d of Leipsic, a periodical of high\r\n      authority and merit, which some American bookseller would do well\r\n      to translate and republish, records in a late number a very\r\n      distressing event of the character in question.\r\n\r\n      An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust\r\n      health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very\r\n      severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at\r\n      once; the skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger\r\n      was apprehended. Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was\r\n      bled, and many other of the ordinary means of relief were\r\n      adopted. Gradually, however, he fell into a more and more\r\n      hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he\r\n      died.\r\n\r\n      The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in\r\n      one of the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday.\r\n      On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as\r\n      usual, much thronged with visitors, and about noon an intense\r\n      excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that,\r\n      while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly\r\n      felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned by some one\r\n      struggling beneath. At first little attention was paid to the\r\n      man\xe2\x80\x99s asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged\r\n      obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length\r\n      their natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly\r\n      procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a\r\n      few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant\r\n      appeared. He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect\r\n      within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he\r\n      had partially uplifted.\r\n\r\n      He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there\r\n      pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic condition.\r\n      After some hours he revived, recognized individuals of his\r\n      acquaintance, and, in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in\r\n      the grave.\r\n\r\n      From what he related, it was clear that he must have been\r\n      conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before\r\n      lapsing into insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely\r\n      filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was\r\n      necessarily admitted. He heard the footsteps of the crowd\r\n      overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn. It was\r\n      the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which\r\n      appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he\r\n      awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his\r\n      position.\r\n\r\n      This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in\r\n      a fair way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the\r\n      quackeries of medical experiment. The galvanic battery was\r\n      applied, and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic\r\n      paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.\r\n\r\n      The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my\r\n      memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where\r\n      its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young\r\n      attorney of London, who had been interred for two days. This\r\n      occurred in 1831, and created, at the time, a very profound\r\n      sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse.\r\n\r\n      The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus\r\n      fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited\r\n      the curiosity of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming\r\n      decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem\r\n      examination, but declined to permit it. As often happens, when\r\n      such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter\r\n      the body and dissect it at leisure, in private. Arrangements were\r\n      easily effected with some of the numerous corps of\r\n      body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third\r\n      night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a\r\n      grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of\r\n      one of the private hospitals.\r\n\r\n      An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen,\r\n      when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested\r\n      an application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another,\r\n      and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to\r\n      characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two\r\n      occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the\r\n      convulsive action.\r\n\r\n      It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought\r\n      expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A\r\n      student, however, was especially desirous of testing a theory of\r\n      his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the\r\n      pectoral muscles. A rough gash was made, and a wire hastily\r\n      brought in contact, when the patient, with a hurried but quite\r\n      unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped into the\r\n      middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds,\r\n      and then\xe2\x80\x94spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words were\r\n      uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell\r\n      heavily to the floor.\r\n\r\n      For some moments all were paralyzed with awe\xe2\x80\x94but the urgency of\r\n      the case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen\r\n      that Mr. Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon\r\n      exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to\r\n      health, and to the society of his friends\xe2\x80\x94from whom, however, all\r\n      knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld, until a relapse was\r\n      no longer to be apprehended. Their wonder\xe2\x80\x94their rapturous\r\n      astonishment\xe2\x80\x94may be conceived.\r\n\r\n      The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is\r\n      involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no\r\n      period was he altogether insensible\xe2\x80\x94that, dully and confusedly,\r\n      he was aware of everything which happened to him, from the moment\r\n      in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in\r\n      which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\n      alive,\xe2\x80\x9d were the uncomprehended words which, upon recognizing the\r\n      locality of the dissecting-room, he had endeavored, in his\r\n      extremity, to utter.\r\n\r\n      It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\n      forbear\xe2\x80\x94for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the\r\n      fact that premature interments occur. When we reflect how very\r\n      rarely, from the nature of the case, we have it in our power to\r\n      detect them, we must admit that they may frequently occur without\r\n      our cognizance. Scarcely, in truth, is a graveyard ever\r\n      encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent, that\r\n      skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most\r\n      fearful of suspicions.\r\n\r\n      Fearful indeed the suspicion\xe2\x80\x94but more fearful the doom! It may be\r\n      asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well\r\n      adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental\r\n      distress, as is burial before death. The unendurable oppression\r\n      of the lungs\xe2\x80\x94the stifling fumes from the damp earth\xe2\x80\x94the clinging\r\n      to the death garments\xe2\x80\x94the rigid embrace of the narrow house\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      blackness of the absolute Night\xe2\x80\x94the silence like a sea that\r\n      overwhelms\xe2\x80\x94the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror\r\n      Worm\xe2\x80\x94these things, with the thoughts of the air and grass above,\r\n      with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but\r\n      informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate\r\n      they can never be informed\xe2\x80\x94that our hopeless portion is that of\r\n      the really dead\xe2\x80\x94these considerations, I say, carry into the\r\n      heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and\r\n      intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must\r\n      recoil. We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth\xe2\x80\x94we can dream\r\n      of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell.\r\n      And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest\r\n      profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred\r\n      awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly\r\n      depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated.\r\n      What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge\xe2\x80\x94of my own\r\n      positive and personal experience.\r\n\r\n      For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular\r\n      disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in\r\n      default of a more definitive title. Although both the immediate\r\n      and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of\r\n      this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent\r\n      character is sufficiently well understood. Its variations seem to\r\n      be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only,\r\n      or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated\r\n      lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the\r\n      pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces\r\n      of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the\r\n      cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can\r\n      detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs.\r\n      Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks\xe2\x80\x94even for\r\n      months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical\r\n      tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the\r\n      state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death.\r\n      Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the\r\n      knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to\r\n      catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all,\r\n      by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are,\r\n      luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are\r\n      unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more\r\n      distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the\r\n      preceding. In this lies the principal security from inhumation.\r\n      The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme\r\n      character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be\r\n      consigned alive to the tomb.\r\n\r\n      My own case differed in no important particular from those\r\n      mentioned in medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent\r\n      cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of\r\n      semi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without\r\n      pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think,\r\n      but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the\r\n      presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the\r\n      crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect\r\n      sensation. At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten.\r\n      I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell\r\n      prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and\r\n      silent, and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation could\r\n      be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a\r\n      gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure.\r\n      Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who\r\n      roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night\xe2\x80\x94just\r\n      so tardily\xe2\x80\x94just so wearily\xe2\x80\x94just so cheerily came back the light\r\n      of the Soul to me.\r\n\r\n      Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health\r\n      appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all\r\n      affected by the one prevalent malady\xe2\x80\x94unless, indeed, an\r\n      idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as\r\n      superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at\r\n      once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for\r\n      many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity\xe2\x80\x94the mental\r\n      faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a\r\n      condition of absolute abeyance.\r\n\r\n      In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of\r\n      moral distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\n      worms, of tombs, and epitaphs.\xe2\x80\x9d I was lost in reveries of death,\r\n      and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my\r\n      brain. The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day\r\n      and night. In the former, the torture of meditation was\r\n      excessive\xe2\x80\x94in the latter, supreme. When the grim Darkness\r\n      overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I\r\n      shook\xe2\x80\x94shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When Nature\r\n      could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I\r\n      consented to sleep\xe2\x80\x94for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking,\r\n      I might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I\r\n      sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of\r\n      phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing,\r\n      hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.\r\n\r\n      From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in\r\n      dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I\r\n      was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration\r\n      and profundity. Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead,\r\n      and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word \xe2\x80\x9cArise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      within my ear.\r\n\r\n      I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure\r\n      of him who had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the\r\n      period at which I had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in\r\n      which I then lay. While I remained motionless, and busied in\r\n      endeavors to collect my thought, the cold hand grasped me\r\n      fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly, while the gibbering\r\n      voice said again:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cArise! did I not bid thee arise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who,\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cart thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI have no name in the regions which I inhabit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\n      voice, mournfully; \xe2\x80\x9cI was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless,\r\n      but am pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder. My teeth chatter\r\n      as I speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of the night\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\n      night without end. But this hideousness is insufferable. How\r\n      canst thou tranquilly sleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these\r\n      great agonies. These sights are more than I can bear. Get thee\r\n      up! Come with me into the outer Night, and let me unfold to thee\r\n      the graves. Is not this a spectacle of woe?\xe2\x80\x94Behold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the\r\n      wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind;\r\n      and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay; so\r\n      that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the\r\n      shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.\r\n      But alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than\r\n      those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble\r\n      struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the\r\n      depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling\r\n      from the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed\r\n      tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a\r\n      greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which\r\n      they had originally been entombed. And the voice again said to me\r\n      as I gazed:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not\xe2\x80\x94oh! is it _not_ a pitiful sight?\xe2\x80\x9d But, before I could\r\n      find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the\r\n      phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a\r\n      sudden violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing\r\n      cries, saying again: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not\xe2\x80\x94O, God, is it _not_ a very\r\n      pitiful sight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night,\r\n      extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours. My\r\n      nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual\r\n      horror. I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any\r\n      exercise that would carry me from home. In fact, I no longer\r\n      dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who\r\n      were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one\r\n      of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition\r\n      could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my\r\n      dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of more than\r\n      customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as\r\n      irrecoverable. I even went so far as to fear that, as I\r\n      occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very\r\n      protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me\r\n      altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the\r\n      most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under\r\n      no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so\r\n      materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible.\r\n      And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason\xe2\x80\x94would\r\n      accept no consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate\r\n      precautions. Among other things, I had the family vault so\r\n      remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. The\r\n      slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the\r\n      tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were\r\n      arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and\r\n      convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach\r\n      of the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly\r\n      and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon\r\n      the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so\r\n      contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be\r\n      sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there was\r\n      suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of\r\n      which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the\r\n      coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse.\r\n      But, alas? what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man?\r\n      Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from\r\n      the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these\r\n      agonies foredoomed!\r\n\r\n      There arrived an epoch\xe2\x80\x94as often before there had arrived\xe2\x80\x94in which\r\n      I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first\r\n      feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly\xe2\x80\x94with a tortoise\r\n      gradation\xe2\x80\x94approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A\r\n      torpid uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No\r\n      care\xe2\x80\x94no hope\xe2\x80\x94no effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in\r\n      the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or\r\n      tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal\r\n      period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening\r\n      feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking\r\n      into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the slight\r\n      quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric\r\n      shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood\r\n      in torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first\r\n      positive effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember.\r\n      And now a partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has\r\n      so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am\r\n      cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary\r\n      sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy. And\r\n      now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit\r\n      is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger\xe2\x80\x94by the one spectral and\r\n      ever-prevalent idea.\r\n\r\n      For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained\r\n      without motion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I\r\n      dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was\r\n      sure. Despair\xe2\x80\x94such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls\r\n      into being\xe2\x80\x94despair alone urged me, after long irresolution, to\r\n      uplift the heavy lids of my eyes. I uplifted them. It was\r\n      dark\xe2\x80\x94all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I knew that the\r\n      crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I had now\r\n      fully recovered the use of my visual faculties\xe2\x80\x94and yet it was\r\n      dark\xe2\x80\x94all dark\xe2\x80\x94the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that\r\n      endureth for evermore.\r\n\r\n      I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved\r\n      convulsively together in the attempt\xe2\x80\x94but no voice issued from the\r\n      cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some\r\n      incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at\r\n      every elaborate and struggling inspiration.\r\n\r\n      The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me\r\n      that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too,\r\n      that I lay upon some hard substance; and by something similar my\r\n      sides were, also, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured\r\n      to stir any of my limbs\xe2\x80\x94but now I violently threw up my arms,\r\n      which had been lying at length, with the wrists crossed. They\r\n      struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above my person\r\n      at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face. I could\r\n      no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.\r\n\r\n      And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub\r\n      Hope\xe2\x80\x94for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made\r\n      spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I\r\n      felt my wrists for the bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now\r\n      the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned\r\n      triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the absence of the\r\n      paddings which I had so carefully prepared\xe2\x80\x94and then, too, there\r\n      came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist\r\n      earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was not within the\r\n      vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from home\xe2\x80\x94while\r\n      among strangers\xe2\x80\x94when, or how, I could not remember\xe2\x80\x94and it was\r\n      they who had buried me as a dog\xe2\x80\x94nailed up in some common\r\n      coffin\xe2\x80\x94and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary\r\n      and nameless grave.\r\n\r\n      As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost\r\n      chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in\r\n      this second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous\r\n      shriek, or yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the\r\n      subterranean Night.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHillo! hillo, there!\xe2\x80\x9d said a gruff voice, in reply.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now!\xe2\x80\x9d said a second.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGet out o\xe2\x80\x99 that!\xe2\x80\x9d said a third.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a\r\n      cattymount?\xe2\x80\x9d said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken\r\n      without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very\r\n      rough-looking individuals. They did not arouse me from my\r\n      slumber\xe2\x80\x94for I was wide awake when I screamed\xe2\x80\x94but they restored me\r\n      to the full possession of my memory.\r\n\r\n      This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied\r\n      by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some\r\n      miles down the banks of the James River. Night approached, and we\r\n      were overtaken by a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at\r\n      anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us\r\n      the only available shelter. We made the best of it, and passed\r\n      the night on board. I slept in one of the only two berths in the\r\n      vessel\xe2\x80\x94and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need\r\n      scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of\r\n      any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of\r\n      its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found\r\n      it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in.\r\n      Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision\xe2\x80\x94for it\r\n      was no dream, and no nightmare\xe2\x80\x94arose naturally from the\r\n      circumstances of my position\xe2\x80\x94from my ordinary bias of thought\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my\r\n      senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time\r\n      after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the crew of\r\n      the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load\r\n      itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a\r\n      silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of\r\n      my customary nightcap.\r\n\r\n      The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for\r\n      the time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully\xe2\x80\x94they\r\n      were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for\r\n      their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion.\r\n      My soul acquired tone\xe2\x80\x94acquired temper. I went abroad. I took\r\n      vigorous exercise. I breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought\r\n      upon other subjects than Death. I discarded my medical books.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cBuchan\xe2\x80\x9d I burned. I read no \xe2\x80\x9cNight Thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94no fustian about\r\n      churchyards\xe2\x80\x94no bugaboo tales\xe2\x80\x94such as this. In short, I became a\r\n      new man, and lived a man\xe2\x80\x99s life. From that memorable night, I\r\n      dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them\r\n      vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had\r\n      been less the consequence than the cause.\r\n\r\n      There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the\r\n      world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell\xe2\x80\x94but\r\n      the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity\r\n      its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of sepulchral terrors\r\n      cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful\xe2\x80\x94but, like the Demons in\r\n      whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must\r\n      sleep, or they will devour us\xe2\x80\x94they must be suffered to slumber,\r\n      or we perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garden like a lady fair was cut,\r\n    That lay as if she slumbered in delight,\r\nAnd to the open skies her eyes did shut.\r\n    The azure fields of Heaven were \xe2\x80\x99sembled right\r\n    In a large round, set with the flowers of light.\r\nThe flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew\r\nThat hung upon their azure leaves did shew\r\nLike twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x94_Giles Fletcher_.\r\n\r\n      From his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend\r\n      Ellison along. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere\r\n      worldly sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person\r\n      of whom I speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the\r\n      doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet\xe2\x80\x94of\r\n      exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the\r\n      chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of Ellison\r\n      I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in man\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\n      nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss. An\r\n      anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that\r\n      in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity\r\n      arises the wretchedness of mankind\xe2\x80\x94that as a species we have in\r\n      our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content\xe2\x80\x94and that,\r\n      even now, in the present darkness and madness of all thought on\r\n      the great question of the social condition, it is not impossible\r\n      that man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly\r\n      fortuitous conditions, may be happy.\r\n\r\n      With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully\r\n      imbued, and thus it is worthy of observation that the\r\n      uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was, in\r\n      great measure, the result of preconcert. It is indeed evident\r\n      that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then,\r\n      stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have\r\n      found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success of\r\n      his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for\r\n      those of pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object\r\n      to pen an essay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be\r\n      summed up in a few words. He admitted but four elementary\r\n      principles, or more strictly, conditions of bliss. That which he\r\n      considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and purely\r\n      physical one of free exercise in the open air. \xe2\x80\x9cThe health,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n      said, \xe2\x80\x9cattainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n      instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to the\r\n      tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be\r\n      fairly considered happier than others. His second condition was\r\n      the love of woman. His third, and most difficult of realization,\r\n      was the contempt of ambition. His fourth was an object of\r\n      unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal,\r\n      the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the\r\n      spirituality of this object.\r\n\r\n      Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts\r\n      lavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he\r\n      exceeded all men. His intellect was of that order to which the\r\n      acquisition of knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a\r\n      necessity. His family was one of the most illustrious of the\r\n      empire. His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women.\r\n      His possessions had been always ample; but on the attainment of\r\n      his majority, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary\r\n      freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the\r\n      whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom fail\r\n      radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their\r\n      objects.\r\n\r\n      It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison\xe2\x80\x99s coming\r\n      of age, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright\r\n      Ellison. This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and,\r\n      having no immediate connections, conceived the whim of suffering\r\n      his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease.\r\n      Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of\r\n      investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of\r\n      blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at the\r\n      end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set\r\n      aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character\r\n      rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government\r\n      was aroused, and a legislative act finally obtained, forbidding\r\n      all similar accumulations. This act, however, did not prevent\r\n      young Ellison from entering into possession, on his twenty-first\r\n      birthday, as the heir of his ancestor Seabright, of a fortune of\r\n      four hundred and fifty millions of dollars. (*1)\r\n\r\n      When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth\r\n      inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to the\r\n      mode of its disposal. The magnitude and the immediate\r\n      availability of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic.\r\n      The possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been\r\n      imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. With riches\r\n      merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy\r\n      to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable\r\n      extravagances of his time\xe2\x80\x94or busying himself with political\r\n      intrigue\xe2\x80\x94or aiming at ministerial power\xe2\x80\x94or purchasing increase of\r\n      nobility\xe2\x80\x94or collecting large museums of virtu\xe2\x80\x94or playing the\r\n      munificent patron of letters, of science, of art\xe2\x80\x94or endowing, and\r\n      bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But\r\n      for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the\r\n      heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford\r\n      too limited a field. Recourse was had to figures, and these but\r\n      sufficed to confound. It was seen that, even at three per cent.,\r\n      the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than\r\n      thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was\r\n      one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month;\r\n      or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day; or\r\n      one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and\r\n      twenty dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track\r\n      of supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to\r\n      imagine. There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison\r\n      would divest himself of at least one-half of his fortune, as of\r\n      utterly superfluous opulence\xe2\x80\x94enriching whole troops of his\r\n      relatives by division of his superabundance. To the nearest of\r\n      these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which was\r\n      his own before the inheritance.\r\n\r\n      I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made\r\n      up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to\r\n      his friends. Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his\r\n      decision. In regard to individual charities he had satisfied his\r\n      conscience. In the possibility of any improvement, properly so\r\n      called, being effected by man himself in the general condition of\r\n      man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little faith. Upon the\r\n      whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back, in very\r\n      great measure, upon self.\r\n\r\n      In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,\r\n      moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme\r\n      majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not\r\n      the sole proper satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively\r\n      felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty. Some\r\n      peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of\r\n      his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism all his\r\n      ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which led\r\n      him to believe that the most advantageous at least, if not the\r\n      sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, lies in the\r\n      creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it\r\n      happened he became neither musician nor poet\xe2\x80\x94if we use this\r\n      latter term in its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been\r\n      that he neglected to become either, merely in pursuance of his\r\n      idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the\r\n      essential principles of happiness on earth. Is it not indeed,\r\n      possible that, while a high order of genius is necessarily\r\n      ambitious, the highest is above that which is termed ambition?\r\n      And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton have\r\n      contentedly remained \xe2\x80\x9cmute and inglorious?\xe2\x80\x9d I believe that the\r\n      world has never seen\xe2\x80\x94and that, unless through some series of\r\n      accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful\r\n      exertion, the world will never see\xe2\x80\x94that full extent of triumphant\r\n      execution, in the richer domains of art, of which the human\r\n      nature is absolutely capable.\r\n\r\n      Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived\r\n      more profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other\r\n      circumstances than those which invested him, it is not impossible\r\n      that he would have become a painter. Sculpture, although in its\r\n      nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and\r\n      consequences, to have occupied, at any time, much of his\r\n      attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which\r\n      the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it\r\n      capable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest,\r\n      the truest, and most natural, if not altogether the most\r\n      extensive province, had been unaccountably neglected. No\r\n      definition had spoken of the landscape-gardener as of the poet;\r\n      yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the\r\n      landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most magnificent\r\n      of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for the\r\n      display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel\r\n      beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast\r\n      superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In\r\n      the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he\r\n      recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of Nature at\r\n      physical loveliness. And in the direction or concentration of\r\n      this effort\xe2\x80\x94or, more properly, in its adaptation to the eyes\r\n      which were to behold it on earth\xe2\x80\x94he perceived that he should be\r\n      employing the best means\xe2\x80\x94laboring to the greatest advantage\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n      the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as poet, but of the\r\n      august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the poetic\r\n      sentiment in man.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIts adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\n      his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward\r\n      solving what has always seemed to me an enigma:\xe2\x80\x94I mean the fact\r\n      (which none but the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of\r\n      scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce. No\r\n      such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the\r\n      canvas of Claude. In the most enchanting of natural landscapes,\r\n      there will always be found a defect or an excess\xe2\x80\x94many excesses\r\n      and defects. While the component parts may defy, individually,\r\n      the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of these parts\r\n      will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no position\r\n      can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth, from\r\n      which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter\r\n      of offence in what is termed the \xe2\x80\x9ccomposition\xe2\x80\x9d of the landscape.\r\n      And yet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are\r\n      justly instructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details\r\n      we shrink from competition. Who shall presume to imitate the\r\n      colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of\r\n      the valley? The criticism which says, of sculpture or\r\n      portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted or idealized\r\n      rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculptural\r\n      combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach\r\n      the living and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the\r\n      principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it\r\n      is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to\r\n      pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. Having, I\r\n      say, felt its truth here; for the feeling is no affectation or\r\n      chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations\r\n      than the sentiments of his art yields the artist. He not only\r\n      believes, but positively knows, that such and such apparently\r\n      arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute\r\n      the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet been matured\r\n      into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis than the\r\n      world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.\r\n      Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the\r\n      voice of all his brethren. Let a \xe2\x80\x9ccomposition\xe2\x80\x9d be defective; let\r\n      an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let\r\n      this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by\r\n      each will its necessity be admitted. And even far more than this;\r\n      in remedy of the defective composition, each insulated member of\r\n      the fraternity would have suggested the identical emendation.\r\n\r\n      I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical\r\n      nature susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her\r\n      susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery I\r\n      had been unable to solve. My own thoughts on the subject had\r\n      rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would\r\n      have so arranged the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface as to have fulfilled at all\r\n      points man\xe2\x80\x99s sense of perfection in the beautiful, the sublime,\r\n      or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had been\r\n      frustrated by the known geological disturbances\xe2\x80\x94disturbances of\r\n      form and color\xe2\x80\x94grouping, in the correction or allaying of which\r\n      lies the soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened,\r\n      however, by the necessity which it involved of considering the\r\n      disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose. It was\r\n      Ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death. He thus\r\n      explained:\xe2\x80\x94Admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the\r\n      first intention. We have then the primitive arrangement of the\r\n      earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface adapted to his blissful estate, as not existent\r\n      but designed. The disturbances were the preparations for his\r\n      subsequently conceived deathful condition.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we regard as exaltation of the\r\n      landscape may be really such, as respects only the moral or human\r\n      point of view. Each alteration of the natural scenery may\r\n      possibly effect a blemish in the picture, if we can suppose this\r\n      picture viewed at large\xe2\x80\x94in mass\xe2\x80\x94from some point distant from the\r\n      earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, although not beyond the limits of its\r\n      atmosphere. It is easily understood that what might improve a\r\n      closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure a general\r\n      or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of\r\n      beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from\r\n      afar, our disorder may seem order\xe2\x80\x94our unpicturesqueness\r\n      picturesque; in a word, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more\r\n      especially than our own, and for whose death-refined appreciation\r\n      of the beautiful, may have been set in array by God the wide\r\n      landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from\r\n      a writer on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have\r\n      well treated his theme:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThere are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the\r\n      natural and the artificial. One seeks to recall the original\r\n      beauty of the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding\r\n      scenery, cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of\r\n      the neighboring land; detecting and bringing into practice those\r\n      nice relations of size, proportion, and color which, hid from the\r\n      common observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced\r\n      student of nature. The result of the natural style of gardening,\r\n      is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n      the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order\xe2\x80\x94than in the\r\n      creation of any special wonders or miracles. The artificial style\r\n      has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify.\r\n      It has a certain general relation to the various styles of\r\n      building. There are the stately avenues and retirements of\r\n      Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English\r\n      style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or\r\n      English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said against\r\n      the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of\r\n      pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is\r\n      partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and\r\n      partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade,\r\n      calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there\r\n      in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of\r\n      care and human interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I have already observed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ellison, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\n      understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling\r\n      the original beauty of the country. The original beauty is never\r\n      so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, every thing\r\n      depends on the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is\r\n      said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of\r\n      size, proportion, and color, is one of those mere vaguenesses of\r\n      speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought. The phrase\r\n      quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no degree.\r\n      That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen\r\n      rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in\r\n      the creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition\r\n      better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to\r\n      the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit\r\n      suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in\r\n      letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while\r\n      that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals\r\n      directly to the understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in\r\n      rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can be\r\n      apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits\r\n      of denial\xe2\x80\x94to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the\r\n      critical art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cCato,\xe2\x80\x9d but we are in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cInferno.\xe2\x80\x9d The thing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and\r\n      the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists of\r\n      the negative school who, through inability to create, have\r\n      scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What,\r\n      in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure\r\n      reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort\r\n      admiration from their instinct of beauty.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThe author\xe2\x80\x99s observations on the artificial style,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\n      Ellison, \xe2\x80\x9care less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a\r\n      garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is just; as also is\r\n      the reference to the sense of human interest. The principle\r\n      expressed is incontrovertible\xe2\x80\x94but there may be something beyond\r\n      it. There may be an object in keeping with the principle\xe2\x80\x94an\r\n      object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by\r\n      individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the\r\n      landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely\r\n      human interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual\r\n      pecuniary resources, might, while retaining the necessary idea of\r\n      art or culture, or, as our author expresses it, of interest, so\r\n      imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty, as\r\n      to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be\r\n      seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the\r\n      advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of the\r\n      harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the most rugged\r\n      of wildernesses\xe2\x80\x94in the most savage of the scenes of pure\r\n      nature\xe2\x80\x94there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is\r\n      apparent to reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious\r\n      force of a feeling. Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty\r\n      design to be one step depressed\xe2\x80\x94to be brought into something like\r\n      harmony or consistency with the sense of human art\xe2\x80\x94to form an\r\n      intermedium between the two:\xe2\x80\x94let us imagine, for example, a\r\n      landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness\xe2\x80\x94whose united\r\n      beauty, magnificence, and strangeness, shall convey the idea of\r\n      care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part of beings\r\n      superior, yet akin to humanity\xe2\x80\x94then the sentiment of interest is\r\n      preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of\r\n      an intermediate or secondary nature\xe2\x80\x94a nature which is not God,\r\n      nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense\r\n      of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a\r\n      vision such as this\xe2\x80\x94in the free exercise in the open air ensured\r\n      by the personal superintendence of his plans\xe2\x80\x94in the unceasing\r\n      object which these plans afforded\xe2\x80\x94in the high spirituality of the\r\n      object\xe2\x80\x94in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to\r\n      feel\xe2\x80\x94in the perennial springs with which it gratified, without\r\n      possibility of satiating, that one master passion of his soul,\r\n      the thirst for beauty, above all, it was in the sympathy of a\r\n      woman, not unwomanly, whose loveliness and love enveloped his\r\n      existence in the purple atmosphere of Paradise, that Ellison\r\n      thought to find, and found, exemption from the ordinary cares of\r\n      humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than\r\n      ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Sta\xc3\xabl.\r\n\r\n      I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of\r\n      the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to\r\n      describe, but am disheartened by the difficulty of description,\r\n      and hesitate between detail and generality. Perhaps the better\r\n      course will be to unite the two in their extremes.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Ellison\xe2\x80\x99s first step regarded, of course, the choice of a\r\n      locality, and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point,\r\n      when the luxuriant nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his\r\n      attention. In fact, he had made up his mind for a voyage to the\r\n      South Seas, when a night\xe2\x80\x99s reflection induced him to abandon the\r\n      idea. \xe2\x80\x9cWere I misanthropic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a locale would suit\r\n      me. The thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion, and the\r\n      difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such case be the charm\r\n      of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the composure but\r\n      not the depression of solitude. There must remain with me a\r\n      certain control over the extent and duration of my repose. There\r\n      will be frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the sympathy\r\n      of the poetic in what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot not\r\n      far from a populous city\xe2\x80\x94whose vicinity, also, will best enable\r\n      me to execute my plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for\r\n      several years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand\r\n      spots with which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation,\r\n      for reasons which satisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We\r\n      came at length to an elevated table-land of wonderful fertility\r\n      and beauty, affording a panoramic prospect very little less in\r\n      extent than that of Aetna, and, in Ellison\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as well as\r\n      my own, surpassing the far-famed view from that mountain in all\r\n      the true elements of the picturesque.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cI am aware,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep\r\n      delight after gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an\r\n      hour, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that here, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the\r\n      most fastidious of men would rest content. This panorama is\r\n      indeed glorious, and I should rejoice in it but for the excess of\r\n      its glory. The taste of all the architects I have ever known\r\n      leads them, for the sake of \xe2\x80\x98prospect,\xe2\x80\x99 to put up buildings on\r\n      hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of its moods,\r\n      but especially in that of extent, startles, excites\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\n      fatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be\r\n      better\xe2\x80\x94for the constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant\r\n      view, the most objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent;\r\n      the worst phase of extent, that of distance. It is at war with\r\n      the sentiment and with the sense of seclusion\xe2\x80\x94the sentiment and\r\n      sense which we seek to humor in \xe2\x80\x98retiring to the country.\xe2\x80\x99 In\r\n      looking from the summit of a mountain we cannot help feeling\r\n      abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant prospects as a\r\n      pestilence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our\r\n      search that we found a locality with which Ellison professed\r\n      himself satisfied. It is, of course, needless to say where was\r\n      the locality. The late death of my friend, in causing his domain\r\n      to be thrown open to certain classes of visitors, has given to\r\n      Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not solemn celebrity,\r\n      similar in kind, although infinitely superior in degree, to that\r\n      which so long distinguished Fonthill.\r\n\r\n      The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visitor left\r\n      the city in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed\r\n      between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed\r\n      innumerable sheep, their white fleeces spotting the vivid green\r\n      of rolling meadows. By degrees the idea of cultivation subsided\r\n      into that of merely pastoral care. This slowly became merged in a\r\n      sense of retirement\xe2\x80\x94this again in a consciousness of solitude. As\r\n      the evening approached, the channel grew more narrow; the banks\r\n      more and more precipitous; and these latter were clothed in rich,\r\n      more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water increased in\r\n      transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at no\r\n      moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance\r\n      than a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned\r\n      within an enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable\r\n      walls of foliage, a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom\r\n      bark which, by some accident having been turned upside down,\r\n      floated in constant company with the substantial one, for the\r\n      purpose of sustaining it. The channel now became a gorge\xe2\x80\x94although\r\n      the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ it merely because\r\n      the language has no word which better represents the most\r\n      striking\xe2\x80\x94not the most distinctive\xe2\x80\x94feature of the scene. The\r\n      character of gorge was maintained only in the height and\r\n      parallelism of the shores; it was lost altogether in their other\r\n      traits. The walls of the ravine (through which the clear water\r\n      still tranquilly flowed) arose to an elevation of a hundred and\r\n      occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet, and inclined so much\r\n      toward each other as, in a great measure, to shut out the light\r\n      of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended densely\r\n      from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole chasm\r\n      an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent and\r\n      intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves,\r\n      so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was,\r\n      moreover, enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The\r\n      thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to\r\n      have undergone modification, there was a weird symmetry, a\r\n      thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not\r\n      a dead branch\xe2\x80\x94not a withered leaf\xe2\x80\x94not a stray pebble\xe2\x80\x94not a patch\r\n      of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled\r\n      up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with a\r\n      sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.\r\n\r\n      Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the\r\n      gloom deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the\r\n      vessel brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a\r\n      circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the\r\n      width of the gorge. It was about two hundred yards in diameter,\r\n      and girt in at all points but one\xe2\x80\x94that immediately fronting the\r\n      vessel as it entered\xe2\x80\x94by hills equal in general height to the\r\n      walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly different character.\r\n      Their sides sloped from the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge at an angle of some\r\n      forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to summit\xe2\x80\x94not\r\n      a perceptible point escaping\xe2\x80\x94in a drapery of the most gorgeous\r\n      flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the\r\n      sea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great\r\n      depth, but so transparent was the water that the bottom, which\r\n      seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster\r\n      pebbles, was distinctly visible by glimpses\xe2\x80\x94that is to say,\r\n      whenever the eye could permit itself not to see, far down in the\r\n      inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the hills. On these\r\n      latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size. The\r\n      impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,\r\n      warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy,\r\n      daintiness, voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of\r\n      culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies,\r\n      laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and fastidious; but as the eye\r\n      traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from its sharp junction\r\n      with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of\r\n      overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy a\r\n      panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden\r\n      onyxes, rolling silently out of the sky.\r\n\r\n      The visitor, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom\r\n      of the ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the\r\n      declining sun, which he had supposed to be already far below the\r\n      horizon, but which now confronts him, and forms the sole\r\n      termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another\r\n      chasm-like rift in the hills.\r\n\r\n      But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far,\r\n      and descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque\r\n      devices in vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and\r\n      beak of this boat arise high above the water, with sharp points,\r\n      so that the general form is that of an irregular crescent. It\r\n      lies on the surface of the bay with the proud grace of a swan. On\r\n      its ermined floor reposes a single feathery paddle of satin-wood;\r\n      but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen. The guest is bidden to\r\n      be of good cheer\xe2\x80\x94that the fates will take care of him. The larger\r\n      vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the canoe, which lies\r\n      apparently motionless in the middle of the lake. While he\r\n      considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a\r\n      gentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around\r\n      until its prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle\r\n      but gradually accelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it\r\n      creates seem to break about the ivory side in divinest\r\n      melody\xe2\x80\x94seem to offer the only possible explanation of the\r\n      soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the\r\n      bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.\r\n\r\n      The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is\r\n      approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To\r\n      the right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly\r\n      wooded. It is observed, however, that the trait of exquisite\r\n      cleanness where the bank dips into the water, still prevails.\r\n      There is not one token of the usual river _d\xc3\xa9bris_. To the left\r\n      the character of the scene is softer and more obviously\r\n      artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very\r\n      gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture\r\n      resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of\r\n      green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest\r\n      emerald. This plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred\r\n      yards; reaching from the river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high,\r\n      which extends, in an infinity of curves, but following the\r\n      general direction of the river, until lost in the distance to the\r\n      westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and has been\r\n      formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of\r\n      the stream\xe2\x80\x99s southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been\r\n      suffered to remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and\r\n      is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral\r\n      honeysuckle, the eglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of\r\n      the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by\r\n      occasional trees of gigantic height, growing singly or in small\r\n      groups, both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall,\r\n      but in close proximity to it; so that frequent limbs (of the\r\n      black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent\r\n      extremities into the water. Farther back within the domain, the\r\n      vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.\r\n\r\n      These things are observed during the canoe\xe2\x80\x99s gradual approach to\r\n      what I have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to\r\n      this, however, its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet\r\n      from the bay is discovered to the left\xe2\x80\x94in which direction the\r\n      wall is also seen to sweep, still following the general course of\r\n      the stream. Down this new opening the eye cannot penetrate very\r\n      far; for the stream, accompanied by the wall, still bends to the\r\n      left, until both are swallowed up by the leaves.\r\n\r\n      The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding\r\n      channel; and here the shore opposite the wall is found to\r\n      resemble that opposite the wall in the straight vista. Lofty\r\n      hills, rising occasionally into mountains, and covered with\r\n      vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in the scene.\r\n\r\n      Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented,\r\n      the voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress\r\n      apparently barred by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished\r\n      gold, elaborately carved and fretted, and reflecting the direct\r\n      rays of the now fast-sinking sun with an effulgence that seems to\r\n      wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames. This gate is\r\n      inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to cross the river\r\n      at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen that the\r\n      main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive\r\n      curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a\r\n      stream of considerable volume, diverging from the principal one,\r\n      makes its way, with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus\r\n      hidden from sight. The canoe falls into the lesser channel and\r\n      approaches the gate. Its ponderous wings are slowly and musically\r\n      expanded. The boat glides between them, and commences a rapid\r\n      descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple\r\n      mountains, whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout\r\n      the full extent of their circuit. Meantime the whole Paradise of\r\n      Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush of entrancing\r\n      melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor;\xe2\x80\x94there\r\n      is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall slender Eastern\r\n      trees\xe2\x80\x94bosky shrubberies\xe2\x80\x94flocks of golden and crimson\r\n      birds\xe2\x80\x94lily-fringed lakes\xe2\x80\x94meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,\r\n      hyacinths, and tuberoses\xe2\x80\x94long intertangled lines of silver\r\n      streamlets\xe2\x80\x94and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of\r\n      semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by\r\n      miracle in mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred\r\n      oriels, minarets, and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom\r\n      handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the\r\n      Genii and of the Gnomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDOR\xe2\x80\x99S COTTAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nA Pendant to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Domain of Arnheim\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      During A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the\r\n      river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined,\r\n      somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land\r\n      undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had\r\n      wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the\r\n      valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet\r\n      village of B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, where I had determined to stop for the night. The\r\n      sun had scarcely shone\xe2\x80\x94strictly speaking\xe2\x80\x94during the day, which\r\n      nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm. A smoky mist,\r\n      resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and\r\n      of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much about\r\n      the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or\r\n      even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch\r\n      farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its\r\n      appearance\xe2\x80\x94although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on\r\n      account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely\r\n      inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my\r\n      hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing\r\n      which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at\r\n      ease\xe2\x80\x94Ponto taking charge of my gun\xe2\x80\x94until at length, just as I had\r\n      begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led\r\n      hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was\r\n      conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track.\r\n      There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light wheels were\r\n      evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown\r\n      undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever\r\n      below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon\xe2\x80\x94the most\r\n      aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however,\r\n      except in being open through the wood\xe2\x80\x94if wood be not too weighty\r\n      a name for such an assemblage of light trees\xe2\x80\x94and except in the\r\n      particulars of evident wheel-tracks\xe2\x80\x94bore no resemblance to any\r\n      road I had before seen. The tracks of which I speak were but\r\n      faintly perceptible\xe2\x80\x94having been impressed upon the firm, yet\r\n      pleasantly moist surface of\xe2\x80\x94what looked more like green Genoese\r\n      velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly\xe2\x80\x94but grass such\r\n      as we seldom see out of England\xe2\x80\x94so short, so thick, so even, and\r\n      so vivid in color. Not a single impediment lay in the\r\n      wheel-route\xe2\x80\x94not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that once\r\n      obstructed the way had been carefully _placed_\xe2\x80\x94not thrown\xe2\x80\x94along\r\n      the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom\r\n      with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly\r\n      picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere,\r\n      luxuriantly, in the interspaces.\r\n\r\n      What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art\r\n      undoubtedly\xe2\x80\x94that did not surprise me\xe2\x80\x94all roads, in the ordinary\r\n      sense, are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to\r\n      wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed\r\n      to have been done, might have been done here\xe2\x80\x94with such natural\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9ccapabilities\xe2\x80\x9d (as they have it in the books on Landscape\r\n      Gardening)\xe2\x80\x94with very little labor and expense. No; it was not the\r\n      amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a\r\n      seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this\r\n      fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered\r\n      admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I\r\n      gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form,\r\n      had superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had\r\n      been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful\r\n      on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the\r\n      Italian term, on the other. There were few straight, and no long\r\n      uninterrupted lines. The same effect of curvature or of color\r\n      appeared twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of\r\n      view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity. It was a piece of\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9ccomposition,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the most fastidiously critical taste\r\n      could scarcely have suggested an emendation.\r\n\r\n      I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now,\r\n      arising, I continued in the same direction. The path was so\r\n      serpentine, that at no moment could I trace its course for more\r\n      than two or three paces in advance. Its character did not undergo\r\n      any material change.\r\n\r\n      Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear\xe2\x80\x94and in a\r\n      few moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more\r\n      abruptly than hitherto, I became aware that a building of some\r\n      kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me. I\r\n      could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which\r\n      occupied all the little valley below. A gentle breeze, however,\r\n      now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while I remained\r\n      standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became\r\n      dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.\r\n\r\n      As it came fully into view\xe2\x80\x94thus gradually as I describe it\xe2\x80\x94piece\r\n      by piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again\r\n      the summit of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the\r\n      whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited\r\n      under the name of \xe2\x80\x9cvanishing pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared,\r\n      the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and\r\n      thence, as if with a slight chassez to the south, had come again\r\n      fully into sight, glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm\r\n      that entered the valley from the west. Suddenly, therefore\xe2\x80\x94and as\r\n      if by the hand of magic\xe2\x80\x94this whole valley and every thing in it\r\n      became brilliantly visible.\r\n\r\n      The first _coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93il_, as the sun slid into the position\r\n      described, impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when\r\n      a boy, by the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical\r\n      spectacle or melodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was\r\n      wanting; for the sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all\r\n      orange and purple; while the vivid green of the grass in the\r\n      valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the\r\n      curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its\r\n      total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.\r\n\r\n      The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog\r\n      canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long;\r\n      while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or\r\n      perhaps two hundred. It was most narrow at its northern\r\n      extremity, opening out as it tended southwardly, but with no very\r\n      precise regularity. The widest portion was within eighty yards of\r\n      the southern extreme. The slopes which encompassed the vale could\r\n      not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face. Here a\r\n      precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety\r\n      feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not\r\n      more than fifty feet wide; but as the visitor proceeded\r\n      southwardly from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his\r\n      left, declivities at once less high, less precipitous, and less\r\n      rocky. All, in a word, sloped and softened to the south; and yet\r\n      the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less high,\r\n      except at two points. One of these I have already spoken of. It\r\n      lay considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting\r\n      sun made its way, as I have before described, into the\r\n      amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite\r\n      embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its\r\n      widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead\r\n      up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored\r\n      mountains and forests. The other opening was directly at the\r\n      southern end of the vale. Here, generally, the slopes were\r\n      nothing more than gentle inclinations, extending from east to\r\n      west about one hundred and fifty yards. In the middle of this\r\n      extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of the\r\n      valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every\r\n      thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the\r\n      north\xe2\x80\x94on the craggy precipice\xe2\x80\x94a few paces from the verge\xe2\x80\x94up\r\n      sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black\r\n      walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak; and the\r\n      strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially,\r\n      spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding southwardly,\r\n      the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees, but less and\r\n      less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the gentler\r\n      elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust\xe2\x80\x94these again by the\r\n      softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple\xe2\x80\x94these yet again by\r\n      still more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of\r\n      the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone\xe2\x80\x94an\r\n      occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom\r\n      of the valley itself\xe2\x80\x94(for it must be borne in mind that the\r\n      vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or\r\n      hillsides)\xe2\x80\x94were to be seen three insulated trees. One was an elm\r\n      of fine size and exquisite form: it stood guard over the southern\r\n      gate of the vale. Another was a hickory, much larger than the\r\n      elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although both were\r\n      exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the\r\n      northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the\r\n      very jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an\r\n      angle of nearly forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of\r\n      the amphitheatre. About thirty yards east of this tree stood,\r\n      however, the pride of the valley, and beyond all question the\r\n      most magnificent tree I have ever seen, unless, perhaps, among\r\n      the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a triple-stemmed\r\n      tulip-tree\xe2\x80\x94the Liriodendron Tulipiferum\xe2\x80\x94one of the natural order\r\n      of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent at about\r\n      three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and\r\n      gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where\r\n      the largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation\r\n      of about eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division\r\n      was one hundred and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty\r\n      the form, or the glossy, vivid green of the leaves of the\r\n      tulip-tree. In the present instance they were fully eight inches\r\n      wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous\r\n      splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive, closely congregated,\r\n      a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! Only thus\r\n      can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. And\r\n      then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated\r\n      columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from\r\n      the ground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of\r\n      other trees scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less\r\n      majestic, filled the valley with more than Arabian perfumes.\r\n\r\n      The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same\r\n      character as that I had found in the road; if anything, more\r\n      deliciously soft, thick, velvety, and miraculously green. It was\r\n      hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained.\r\n\r\n      I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the\r\n      northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and\r\n      slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the\r\n      group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here,\r\n      after encircling the tree, it passed on a little to the north of\r\n      east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and\r\n      making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the\r\n      midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.\r\n      At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right\r\n      angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as\r\n      it went\xe2\x80\x94until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure\r\n      (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower\r\n      extremity of the vale. This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards\r\n      in diameter at its widest part. No crystal could be clearer than\r\n      its waters. Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted\r\n      altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its banks, of the\r\n      emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off\r\n      into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so\r\n      perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that\r\n      where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it\r\n      was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and\r\n      some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be\r\n      almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of\r\n      veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to believe that\r\n      they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch\r\n      canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its\r\n      minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most\r\n      exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing with\r\n      flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just\r\n      enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a\r\n      fowl-house\xe2\x80\x94arose from the lake not far from its northern shore\xe2\x80\x94to\r\n      which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light-looking\r\n      and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad\r\n      and thick plank of the tulip wood. This was forty feet long, and\r\n      spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but\r\n      very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. From the\r\n      southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the\r\n      rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,\r\n      finally passed through the \xe2\x80\x9cdepression\xe2\x80\x9d (already described) in\r\n      the middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer\r\n      precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way\r\n      to the Hudson.\r\n\r\n      The lake was deep\xe2\x80\x94at some points thirty feet\xe2\x80\x94but the rivulet\r\n      seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight.\r\n      Its bottom and banks were as those of the pond\xe2\x80\x94if a defect could\r\n      have been attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of\r\n      excessive neatness.\r\n\r\n      The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an\r\n      occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common\r\n      snowball, or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a\r\n      clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties.\r\n      These latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the\r\n      soil, so as to give the plants the appearance of being\r\n      indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn\xe2\x80\x99s velvet was exquisitely\r\n      spotted with sheep\xe2\x80\x94a considerable flock of which roamed about the\r\n      vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of\r\n      brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in\r\n      vigilant attendance upon these animals, each and all.\r\n\r\n      Along the eastern and western cliffs\xe2\x80\x94where, toward the upper\r\n      portion of the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less\r\n      precipitous\xe2\x80\x94grew ivy in great profusion\xe2\x80\x94so that only here and\r\n      there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained. The\r\n      northern precipice, in like manner, was almost entirely clothed\r\n      by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some springing from the soil\r\n      at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges on its face.\r\n\r\n      The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this\r\n      little domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient\r\n      height to prevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence\r\n      kind was observable elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial\r\n      enclosure needed:\xe2\x80\x94any stray sheep, for example, which should\r\n      attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine,\r\n      would find its progress arrested, after a few yards\xe2\x80\x99 advance, by\r\n      the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that\r\n      had arrested my attention as I first drew near the domain. In\r\n      short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a\r\n      rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which I\r\n      stopped to reconnoitre the scene.\r\n\r\n      I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through\r\n      the whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have\r\n      said, were first from west to east, and then from north to south.\r\n      At the turn, the stream, sweeping backward, made an almost\r\n      circular loop, so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an\r\n      island, and which included about the sixteenth of an acre. On\r\n      this peninsula stood a dwelling-house\xe2\x80\x94and when I say that this\r\n      house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, \xe2\x80\x9cetait d\xe2\x80\x99une\r\n      architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean,\r\n      merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense\r\n      of combined novelty and propriety\xe2\x80\x94in a word, of poetry\xe2\x80\x94(for, than\r\n      in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in\r\n      the abstract, a more rigorous definition)\xe2\x80\x94and I do not mean that\r\n      merely outre was perceptible in any respect.\r\n\r\n      In fact nothing could well be more simple\xe2\x80\x94more utterly\r\n      unpretending than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay\r\n      altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture. I could have\r\n      fancied, while I looked at it, that some eminent\r\n      landscape-painter had built it with his brush.\r\n\r\n      The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not\r\n      altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to\r\n      survey the house. I will therefore describe it as I afterwards\r\n      saw it\xe2\x80\x94from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme\r\n      of the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n      The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen\r\n      broad\xe2\x80\x94certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to\r\n      the apex of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To\r\n      the west end of this structure was attached one about a third\r\n      smaller in all its proportions:\xe2\x80\x94the line of its front standing\r\n      back about two yards from that of the larger house, and the line\r\n      of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below that\r\n      of the roof adjoining. At right angles to these buildings, and\r\n      from the rear of the main one\xe2\x80\x94not exactly in the middle\xe2\x80\x94extended\r\n      a third compartment, very small\xe2\x80\x94being, in general, one-third less\r\n      than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were very\r\n      steep\xe2\x80\x94sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave\r\n      curve, and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in\r\n      front, so as to form the roofs of two piazzas. These latter\r\n      roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had the air of\r\n      needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at\r\n      the corners alone. The roof of the northern wing was merely an\r\n      extension of a portion of the main roof. Between the chief\r\n      building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender\r\n      square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and red:\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n      slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables\r\n      the roofs also projected very much:\xe2\x80\x94in the main building about\r\n      four feet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was\r\n      not exactly in the main division, being a little to the\r\n      east\xe2\x80\x94while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not\r\n      extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than\r\n      usual\xe2\x80\x94they had single shutters like doors\xe2\x80\x94the panes were of\r\n      lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself had its upper half\r\n      of glass, also in lozenge panes\xe2\x80\x94a movable shutter secured it at\r\n      night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and quite\r\n      simple\xe2\x80\x94a single window looked out to the south. There was no\r\n      external door to the north wing, and it also had only one window\r\n      to the east.\r\n\r\n      The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with\r\n      a balustrade) running diagonally across it\xe2\x80\x94the ascent being from\r\n      the south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps\r\n      gave access to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft\xe2\x80\x94for\r\n      it was lighted only by a single window to the north, and seemed\r\n      to have been intended as a store-room.\r\n\r\n      The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors,\r\n      as is usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat\r\n      irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf,\r\n      affording comfortable footing in all weather. Excellent paths of\r\n      the same material\xe2\x80\x94not nicely adapted, but with the velvety sod\r\n      filling frequent intervals between the stones, led hither and\r\n      thither from the house, to a crystal spring about five paces off,\r\n      to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to the north,\r\n      beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts\r\n      and catalpas.\r\n\r\n      Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood\r\n      the dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to\r\n      foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no\r\n      little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could\r\n      be. From various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds.\r\n      In one, a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top, revelled a\r\n      mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a third the impudent\r\n      bobolink\xe2\x80\x94while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly\r\n      vocal with canaries.\r\n\r\n      The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet\r\n      honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure\r\n      and its west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled\r\n      luxuriance. Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the\r\n      lower roof\xe2\x80\x94then to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter\r\n      it continued to writhe on, throwing out tendrils to the right and\r\n      left, until at length it fairly attained the east gable, and fell\r\n      trailing over the stairs.\r\n\r\n      The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the\r\n      old-fashioned Dutch shingles\xe2\x80\x94broad, and with unrounded corners.\r\n      It is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it\r\n      the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top\xe2\x80\x94after the\r\n      manner of Egyptian architecture; and in the present instance,\r\n      this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of\r\n      gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the\r\n      buildings.\r\n\r\n      The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with\r\n      which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip\r\n      tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily\r\n      be conceived by an artist.\r\n\r\n      From the position near the stone wall, as described, the\r\n      buildings were seen at great advantage\xe2\x80\x94for the southeastern angle\r\n      was thrown forward\xe2\x80\x94so that the eye took in at once the whole of\r\n      the two fronts, with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the\r\n      same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern\r\n      wing, with parts of a pretty roof to the spring-house, and nearly\r\n      half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near\r\n      vicinity of the main buildings.\r\n\r\n      I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long\r\n      enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was\r\n      clear that I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had\r\n      thus good traveller\xe2\x80\x99s excuse to open the gate before me, and\r\n      inquire my way, at all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.\r\n\r\n      The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural\r\n      ledge, sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern\r\n      cliffs. It led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and\r\n      thence over the bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front\r\n      door. In this progress, I took notice that no sight of the\r\n      out-houses could be obtained.\r\n\r\n      As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards\r\n      me in stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a\r\n      tiger. I held him out my hand, however, in token of amity\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\n      never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to\r\n      his courtesy. He not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but\r\n      absolutely offered me his paw\xe2\x80\x94afterward extending his civilities\r\n      to Ponto.\r\n\r\n      As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the\r\n      door, which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the\r\n      threshold\xe2\x80\x94that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of\r\n      age\xe2\x80\x94slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium\r\n      height. As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step\r\n      altogether indescribable. I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cSurely here I have\r\n      found the perfection of natural, in contradistinction from\r\n      artificial grace.\xe2\x80\x9d The second impression which she made on me,\r\n      but by far the more vivid of the two, was that of enthusiasm. So\r\n      intense an expression of romance, perhaps I should call it, or of\r\n      unworldliness, as that which gleamed from her deep-set eyes, had\r\n      never so sunk into my heart of hearts before. I know not how it\r\n      is, but this peculiar expression of the eye, wreathing itself\r\n      occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful, if not\r\n      absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cRomance,\xe2\x80\x9d provided my readers fully comprehended what I would\r\n      here imply by the word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cromance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwomanliness\xe2\x80\x9d seem to me\r\n      convertible terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman,\r\n      is simply her womanhood. The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from\r\n      the interior call her \xe2\x80\x9cAnnie, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d) were \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual grey;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      her hair, a light chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of\r\n      her.\r\n\r\n      At her most courteous of invitations, I entered\xe2\x80\x94passing first\r\n      into a tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I\r\n      took notice that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such\r\n      as those in front of the house; to the left, a door leading into\r\n      the principal room; while, opposite me, an open door enabled me\r\n      to see a small apartment, just the size of the vestibule,\r\n      arranged as a study, and having a large bow window looking out to\r\n      the north.\r\n\r\n      Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor\xe2\x80\x94for this,\r\n      I afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in\r\n      his manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the\r\n      arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me,\r\n      than the personal appearance of the tenant.\r\n\r\n      The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened\r\n      into the parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking\r\n      toward the brook. At the west end of the parlor, were a\r\n      fireplace, and a door leading into the west wing\xe2\x80\x94probably a\r\n      kitchen.\r\n\r\n      Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the\r\n      parlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent\r\n      texture\xe2\x80\x94a white ground, spotted with small circular green\r\n      figures. At the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet\r\n      muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung decisively, perhaps\r\n      rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor\xe2\x80\x94just to\r\n      the floor. The walls were prepared with a French paper of great\r\n      delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running\r\n      zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of\r\n      Julien\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the\r\n      wall without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of\r\n      Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9ccarnival piece,\xe2\x80\x9d spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek\r\n      female head\xe2\x80\x94a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an\r\n      expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my\r\n      attention.\r\n\r\n      The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few\r\n      chairs (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9csettee;\xe2\x80\x9d its material was plain maple painted a creamy white,\r\n      slightly interstriped with green; the seat of cane. The chairs\r\n      and table were \xe2\x80\x9cto match,\xe2\x80\x9d but the forms of all had evidently\r\n      been designed by the same brain which planned \xe2\x80\x9cthe grounds;\xe2\x80\x9d it\r\n      is impossible to conceive anything more graceful.\r\n\r\n      On the table were a few books; a large, square, crystal bottle of\r\n      some novel perfume; a plain ground glass _astral_ (not solar)\r\n      lamp with an Italian shade; and a large vase of\r\n      resplendently-blooming flowers. Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous\r\n      colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the\r\n      apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with a vase of\r\n      brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the\r\n      room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely\r\n      contents. One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and\r\n      late violets clustered about the open windows.\r\n\r\n      It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in\r\n      detail, a picture of Mr. Landor\xe2\x80\x99s residence\xe2\x80\x94as I found it. How he\r\n      made it what it was\xe2\x80\x94and why\xe2\x80\x94with some particulars of Mr. Landor\r\n      himself\xe2\x80\x94may, possibly form the subject of another article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WILSON\r\n\r\n\r\n    What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,\r\n    That spectre in my path?\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x94_Chamberlayne\xe2\x80\x99s Pharronida._\r\n\r\n      Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair\r\n      page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real\r\n      appellation. This has been already too much an object for the\r\n      scorn\xe2\x80\x94for the horror\xe2\x80\x94for the detestation of my race. To the\r\n      uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds\r\n      bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all outcasts most\r\n      abandoned!\xe2\x80\x94to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its honors,\r\n      to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?\xe2\x80\x94and a cloud, dense,\r\n      dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy\r\n      hopes and heaven?\r\n\r\n      I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my\r\n      later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This\r\n      epoch\xe2\x80\x94these later years\xe2\x80\x94took unto themselves a sudden elevation\r\n      in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to\r\n      assign. Men usually grow base by degrees. From me, in an instant,\r\n      all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial\r\n      wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than\r\n      the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance\xe2\x80\x94what one event\r\n      brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate.\r\n      Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a\r\n      softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through\r\n      the dim valley, for the sympathy\xe2\x80\x94I had nearly said for the\r\n      pity\xe2\x80\x94of my fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have\r\n      been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human\r\n      control. I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I\r\n      am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness\r\n      of error. I would have them allow\xe2\x80\x94what they cannot refrain from\r\n      allowing\xe2\x80\x94that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as\r\n      great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before\xe2\x80\x94certainly,\r\n      never thus fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus\r\n      suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not\r\n      now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest\r\n      of all sublunary visions?\r\n\r\n      I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily\r\n      excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable;\r\n      and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully\r\n      inherited the family character. As I advanced in years it was\r\n      more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of\r\n      serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to\r\n      myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and\r\n      a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset\r\n      with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could\r\n      do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished\r\n      me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete\r\n      failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine.\r\n      Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when\r\n      few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to\r\n      the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the\r\n      master of my own actions.\r\n\r\n      My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a\r\n      large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of\r\n      England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees,\r\n      and where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it\r\n      was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old\r\n      town. At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness\r\n      of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its\r\n      thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight,\r\n      at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour,\r\n      with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky\r\n      atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and\r\n      asleep.\r\n\r\n      It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any\r\n      manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the\r\n      school and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am\xe2\x80\x94misery, alas!\r\n      only too real\xe2\x80\x94I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however\r\n      slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details.\r\n      These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in\r\n      themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance, as\r\n      connected with a period and a locality when and where I recognise\r\n      the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so\r\n      fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.\r\n\r\n      The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were\r\n      extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of\r\n      mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like\r\n      rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but\r\n      thrice a week\xe2\x80\x94once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by\r\n      two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body\r\n      through some of the neighbouring fields\xe2\x80\x94and twice during Sunday,\r\n      when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and\r\n      evening service in the one church of the village. Of this church\r\n      the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of\r\n      wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote\r\n      pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended\r\n      the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely\r\n      benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig\r\n      so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast,\xe2\x80\x94-could this be he\r\n      who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments,\r\n      administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy?\r\n      Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!\r\n\r\n      At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.\r\n      It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with\r\n      jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire!\r\n      It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and\r\n      ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty\r\n      hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery\xe2\x80\x94a world of matter for\r\n      solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.\r\n\r\n      The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many\r\n      capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest\r\n      constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine\r\n      hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor\r\n      anything similar within it. Of course it was in the rear of the\r\n      house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other\r\n      shrubs, but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare\r\n      occasions indeed\xe2\x80\x94such as a first advent to school or final\r\n      departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having\r\n      called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or\r\n      Midsummer holidays.\r\n\r\n      But the house!\xe2\x80\x94how quaint an old building was this!\xe2\x80\x94to me how\r\n      veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its\r\n      windings\xe2\x80\x94to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult,\r\n      at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two\r\n      stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there\r\n      were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or\r\n      descent. Then the lateral branches were\r\n      innumerable\xe2\x80\x94inconceivable\xe2\x80\x94and so returning in upon themselves,\r\n      that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not\r\n      very far different from those with which we pondered upon\r\n      infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never\r\n      able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the\r\n      little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or\r\n      twenty other scholars.\r\n\r\n      The school-room was the largest in the house\xe2\x80\x94I could not help\r\n      thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally\r\n      low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a\r\n      remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight\r\n      or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, \xe2\x80\x9cduring hours,\xe2\x80\x9d of our\r\n      principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure,\r\n      with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cDominie,\xe2\x80\x9d we would all have willingly perished by the _peine\r\n      forte et dure_. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far\r\n      less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of\r\n      these was the pulpit of the \xe2\x80\x9cclassical\xe2\x80\x9d usher, one of the\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish and mathematical.\xe2\x80\x9d Interspersed about the room, crossing\r\n      and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches\r\n      and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with\r\n      much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names\r\n      at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts\r\n      of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original\r\n      form might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge\r\n      bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock\r\n      of stupendous dimensions at the other.\r\n\r\n      Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I\r\n      passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third\r\n      lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no\r\n      external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the\r\n      apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more\r\n      intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury,\r\n      or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first\r\n      mental development had in it much of the uncommon\xe2\x80\x94even much of\r\n      the _outr\xc3\xa9_. Upon mankind at large the events of very early\r\n      existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All\r\n      is gray shadow\xe2\x80\x94a weak and irregular remembrance\xe2\x80\x94an indistinct\r\n      regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me\r\n      this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with the energy of\r\n      a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as\r\n      deep, and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian\r\n      medals.\r\n\r\n      Yet in fact\xe2\x80\x94in the fact of the world\xe2\x80\x99s view\xe2\x80\x94how little was there\r\n      to remember! The morning\xe2\x80\x99s awakening, the nightly summons to bed;\r\n      the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and\r\n      perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes,\r\n      its intrigues;\xe2\x80\x94these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were\r\n      made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich\r\n      incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most\r\n      passionate and spirit-stirring. \xe2\x80\x9c_Oh, le bon temps, que ce si\xc3\xa8cle\r\n      de fer!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my\r\n      disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my\r\n      schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an\r\n      ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself;\xe2\x80\x94over all with\r\n      a single exception. This exception was found in the person of a\r\n      scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and\r\n      surname as myself;\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable;\r\n      for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those\r\n      everyday appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have\r\n      been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this\r\n      narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\n      fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake\r\n      alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted \xe2\x80\x9cour set,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\n      sports and broils of the play-ground\xe2\x80\x94to refuse implicit belief in\r\n      my assertions, and submission to my will\xe2\x80\x94indeed, to interfere\r\n      with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there\r\n      is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the\r\n      despotism of a master-mind in boyhood over the less energetic\r\n      spirits of its companions.\r\n\r\n      Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest\r\n      embarrassment; the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which\r\n      in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I\r\n      secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the\r\n      equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of\r\n      his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a\r\n      perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority\xe2\x80\x94even this equality\xe2\x80\x94was\r\n      in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by\r\n      some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it.\r\n      Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his\r\n      impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not\r\n      more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of\r\n      the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind\r\n      which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been\r\n      supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart,\r\n      astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I\r\n      could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder,\r\n      abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his\r\n      insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and\r\n      assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only\r\n      conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate\r\n      self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and\r\n      protection.\r\n\r\n      Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, conjoined\r\n      with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having\r\n      entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion\r\n      that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy.\r\n      These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the\r\n      affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or should have\r\n      said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected\r\n      with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must\r\n      have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby\xe2\x80\x99s, I casually\r\n      learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January,\r\n      1813\xe2\x80\x94and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day\r\n      is precisely that of my own nativity.\r\n\r\n      It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety\r\n      occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable\r\n      spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him\r\n      altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in\r\n      which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some\r\n      manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved\r\n      it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on\r\n      his own, kept us always upon what are called \xe2\x80\x9cspeaking terms,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      while there were many points of strong congeniality in our\r\n      tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position\r\n      alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is\r\n      difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real\r\n      feelings towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous\r\n      admixture;\xe2\x80\x94some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred,\r\n      some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy\r\n      curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in\r\n      addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of\r\n      companions.\r\n\r\n      It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between\r\n      us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many,\r\n      either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical\r\n      joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather\r\n      than into a more serious and determined hostility. But my\r\n      endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful,\r\n      even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my\r\n      namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and\r\n      quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own\r\n      jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses\r\n      to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point,\r\n      and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from\r\n      constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist\r\n      less at his wit\xe2\x80\x99s end than myself;\xe2\x80\x94my rival had a weakness in the\r\n      faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his\r\n      voice at any time above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did\r\n      not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.\r\n\r\n      Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form\r\n      of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his\r\n      sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex\r\n      me, is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he\r\n      habitually practised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to\r\n      my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian\r\n      praenomen. The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the\r\n      day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the\r\n      academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly\r\n      disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be\r\n      the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in\r\n      my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the\r\n      school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable\r\n      coincidence, be often confounded with my own.\r\n\r\n      The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every\r\n      circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical,\r\n      between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the\r\n      remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we\r\n      were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even\r\n      singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of\r\n      feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship,\r\n      which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word, nothing\r\n      could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously\r\n      concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of\r\n      mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I\r\n      had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter\r\n      of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this\r\n      similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even\r\n      observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed it in all\r\n      its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he\r\n      could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of\r\n      annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more\r\n      than ordinary penetration.\r\n\r\n      His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in\r\n      words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My\r\n      dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner\r\n      were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his\r\n      constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him. My\r\n      louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key\xe2\x80\x94it\r\n      was identical; _and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo\r\n      of my own_.\r\n\r\n      How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it\r\n      could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture\r\n      to describe. I had but one consolation\xe2\x80\x94in the fact that the\r\n      imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I\r\n      had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of\r\n      my namesake himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom\r\n      the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the\r\n      sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful\r\n      of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours\r\n      might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not\r\n      feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in\r\n      his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not\r\n      resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so\r\n      readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the\r\n      master air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in\r\n      a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit\r\n      of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.\r\n\r\n      I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of\r\n      patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent\r\n      officious interference with my will. This interference often took\r\n      the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but\r\n      hinted or insinuated. I received it with a repugnance which\r\n      gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let\r\n      me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no\r\n      occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of\r\n      those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming\r\n      inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general\r\n      talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that\r\n      I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had\r\n      I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning\r\n      whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly\r\n      despised.\r\n\r\n      As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his\r\n      distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly\r\n      what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in\r\n      the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in\r\n      regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship;\r\n      but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy,\r\n      although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt,\r\n      in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar\r\n      proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one\r\n      occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a\r\n      show of avoiding me.\r\n\r\n      It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an\r\n      altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than\r\n      usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an\r\n      openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered,\r\n      or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and general\r\n      appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply\r\n      interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest\r\n      infancy\xe2\x80\x94wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when\r\n      memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the\r\n      sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with\r\n      difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with\r\n      the being who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago\xe2\x80\x94some\r\n      point of the past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however,\r\n      faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define\r\n      the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular\r\n      namesake.\r\n\r\n      The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several\r\n      large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the\r\n      greater number of the students. There were, however, (as must\r\n      necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned,) many\r\n      little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and\r\n      these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as\r\n      dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were\r\n      capable of accommodating but a single individual. One of these\r\n      small apartments was occupied by Wilson.\r\n\r\n      One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and\r\n      immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every\r\n      one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole\r\n      through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to\r\n      that of my rival. I had long been plotting one of those\r\n      ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had\r\n      hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention,\r\n      now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him\r\n      feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.\r\n      Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the\r\n      lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step,\r\n      and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of\r\n      his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again\r\n      approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the\r\n      prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the\r\n      bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the\r\n      same moment, upon his countenance. I looked;\xe2\x80\x94and a numbness, an\r\n      iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved,\r\n      my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an\r\n      objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered\r\n      the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these\xe2\x80\x94these\r\n      the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were\r\n      his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they\r\n      were not. What was there about them to confound me in this\r\n      manner? I gazed;\xe2\x80\x94while my brain reeled with a multitude of\r\n      incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared\xe2\x80\x94assuredly not thus\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n      the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour\r\n      of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his\r\n      dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits,\r\n      and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human\r\n      possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the\r\n      habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and\r\n      with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently\r\n      from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old\r\n      academy, never to enter them again.\r\n\r\n      After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I\r\n      found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been\r\n      sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr.\r\n      Bransby\xe2\x80\x99s, or at least to effect a material change in the nature\r\n      of the feelings with which I remembered them. The truth\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      tragedy\xe2\x80\x94of the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt\r\n      the evidence of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at\r\n      all but with wonder at extent of human credulity, and a smile at\r\n      the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily\r\n      possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be\r\n      diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex\r\n      of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so\r\n      recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past\r\n      hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and\r\n      left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.\r\n\r\n      I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable\r\n      profligacy here\xe2\x80\x94a profligacy which set at defiance the laws,\r\n      while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three years of\r\n      folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of\r\n      vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily\r\n      stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a\r\n      small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal\r\n      in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for our\r\n      debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The\r\n      wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps\r\n      more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already\r\n      faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance\r\n      was at its height. Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I\r\n      was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted\r\n      profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the\r\n      violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment,\r\n      and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that\r\n      some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me\r\n      in the hall.\r\n\r\n      Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather\r\n      delighted than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a\r\n      few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. In this\r\n      low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all\r\n      was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made\r\n      its way through the semi-circular window. As I put my foot over\r\n      the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my\r\n      own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut\r\n      in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This\r\n      the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his\r\n      face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode\r\n      hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of\r\n      petulant impatience, whispered the words \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Wilson!\xe2\x80\x9d in my\r\n      ear.\r\n\r\n      I grew perfectly sober in an instant.\r\n\r\n      There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the\r\n      tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my\r\n      eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement;\r\n      but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It was the\r\n      pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing\r\n      utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the\r\n      key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables,\r\n      which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and\r\n      struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I\r\n      could recover the use of my senses he was gone.\r\n\r\n      Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my\r\n      disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some\r\n      weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped\r\n      in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise\r\n      from my perception the identity of the singular individual who\r\n      thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me\r\n      with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was this\r\n      Wilson?\xe2\x80\x94and whence came he?\xe2\x80\x94and what were his purposes? Upon\r\n      neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely\r\n      ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his\r\n      family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby\xe2\x80\x99s academy on the\r\n      afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief\r\n      period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all\r\n      absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon\r\n      went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with\r\n      an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to\r\n      indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart,\xe2\x80\x94to vie\r\n      in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the\r\n      wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n      Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament\r\n      broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common\r\n      restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it\r\n      were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it\r\n      suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that,\r\n      giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief\r\n      appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most\r\n      dissolute university of Europe.\r\n\r\n      It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so\r\n      utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek\r\n      acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession,\r\n      and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to\r\n      practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already\r\n      enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my\r\n      fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very\r\n      enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable\r\n      sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason\r\n      of the impunity with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among\r\n      my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the\r\n      clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such\r\n      courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n      noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford\xe2\x80\x94him whose follies\r\n      (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled\r\n      fancy\xe2\x80\x94whose errors but inimitable whim\xe2\x80\x94whose darkest vice but a\r\n      careless and dashing extravagance?\r\n\r\n      I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when\r\n      there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman,\r\n      Glendinning\xe2\x80\x94rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus\xe2\x80\x94his riches,\r\n      too, as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and,\r\n      of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. I\r\n      frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually\r\n      to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I\r\n      met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be\r\n      final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr.\r\n      Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice,\r\n      entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to\r\n      this a better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party\r\n      of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the\r\n      introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in\r\n      the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a\r\n      vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary\r\n      upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how\r\n      any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.\r\n\r\n      We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at\r\n      length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole\r\n      antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite _\xc3\xa9cart\xc3\xa9!_ The rest of\r\n      the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned\r\n      their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. The\r\n      _parvenu_, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part\r\n      of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played,\r\n      with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I\r\n      thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a\r\n      very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount,\r\n      when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what\r\n      I had been coolly anticipating\xe2\x80\x94he proposed to double our already\r\n      extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and\r\n      not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some\r\n      angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I\r\n      finally comply. The result, of course, did but prove how entirely\r\n      the prey was in my toils: in less than an hour he had quadrupled\r\n      his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the\r\n      florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I\r\n      perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to\r\n      my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager\r\n      inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as\r\n      yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed,\r\n      very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he\r\n      was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most\r\n      readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the\r\n      preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates,\r\n      than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist,\r\n      peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some\r\n      expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an\r\n      ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning,\r\n      gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under\r\n      circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all,\r\n      should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.\r\n\r\n      What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The\r\n      pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed\r\n      gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was\r\n      maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks\r\n      tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast\r\n      upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even own that\r\n      an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted\r\n      from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which\r\n      ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all\r\n      at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and\r\n      rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every\r\n      candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to\r\n      perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and\r\n      closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total;\r\n      and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before\r\n      any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into\r\n      which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the\r\n      intruder.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low, distinct, and\r\n      never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow\r\n      of my bones, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour,\r\n      because in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty. You are,\r\n      beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who\r\n      has to-night won at _\xc3\xa9cart\xc3\xa9_ a large sum of money from Lord\r\n      Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and\r\n      decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.\r\n      Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff\r\n      of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be\r\n      found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered\r\n      morning wrapper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have\r\n      heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once,\r\n      and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I\xe2\x80\x94shall I describe my\r\n      sensations? Must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned?\r\n      Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. Many hands\r\n      roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately\r\n      reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were\r\n      found all the court cards essential in _\xc3\xa9cart\xc3\xa9_, and, in the\r\n      pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those\r\n      used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of\r\n      the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being\r\n      slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at\r\n      the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary,\r\n      at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his\r\n      antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth,\r\n      will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in\r\n      the records of the game.\r\n\r\n      Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected\r\n      me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure,\r\n      with which it was received.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his\r\n      feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wilson,\r\n      this is your property.\xe2\x80\x9d (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting\r\n      my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper,\r\n      putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.) \xe2\x80\x9cI presume it is\r\n      supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with\r\n      a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed,\r\n      we have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of\r\n      quitting Oxford\xe2\x80\x94at all events, of quitting instantly my\r\n      chambers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I\r\n      should have resented this galling language by immediate personal\r\n      violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested\r\n      by a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had\r\n      worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how\r\n      extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion,\r\n      too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to\r\n      an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous\r\n      nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had\r\n      picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the\r\n      apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon\r\n      terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where\r\n      I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented\r\n      me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest\r\n      possible particular. The singular being who had so disastrously\r\n      exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none\r\n      had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the\r\n      exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the\r\n      one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own;\r\n      left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next\r\n      morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford\r\n      to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.\r\n\r\n      I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation,\r\n      and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion\r\n      had as yet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had\r\n      fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in\r\n      my concerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief.\r\n      Villain!\xe2\x80\x94at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an\r\n      officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition! At\r\n      Vienna, too\xe2\x80\x94at Berlin\xe2\x80\x94and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had I not\r\n      bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable\r\n      tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a\r\n      pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.\r\n\r\n      And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit,\r\n      would I demand the questions \xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x94whence came he?\xe2\x80\x94and what\r\n      are his objects?\xe2\x80\x9d But no answer was there found. And then I\r\n      scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods,\r\n      and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision. But even\r\n      here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. It\r\n      was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied\r\n      instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so\r\n      crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those\r\n      actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in\r\n      bitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an\r\n      authority so imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural\r\n      rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!\r\n\r\n      I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very\r\n      long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous\r\n      dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with\r\n      myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied\r\n      interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the\r\n      features of his face. Be Wilson what he might, this, at least,\r\n      was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an\r\n      instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\n      destroyer of my honor at Oxford,\xe2\x80\x94in him who thwarted my ambition\r\n      at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or\r\n      what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,\xe2\x80\x94that in this, my\r\n      arch-enemy and evil genius, could fail to recognise the William\r\n      Wilson of my school boy days,\xe2\x80\x94the namesake, the companion, the\r\n      rival,\xe2\x80\x94the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby\xe2\x80\x99s?\r\n      Impossible!\xe2\x80\x94But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the\r\n      drama.\r\n\r\n      Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination.\r\n      The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the\r\n      elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent\r\n      omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of\r\n      even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and\r\n      assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me\r\n      with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to\r\n      suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to\r\n      his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had given myself up\r\n      entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary\r\n      temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I began to\r\n      murmur,\xe2\x80\x94to hesitate,\xe2\x80\x94to resist. And was it only fancy which\r\n      induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness,\r\n      that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this\r\n      as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope,\r\n      and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and\r\n      desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be\r\n      enslaved.\r\n\r\n      It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18\xe2\x80\x94, that I attended a\r\n      masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I\r\n      had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the\r\n      wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded\r\n      rooms irritated me beyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of\r\n      forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a\r\n      little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking,\r\n      (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young, the gay,\r\n      the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too\r\n      unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the\r\n      secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now,\r\n      having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my\r\n      way into her presence. At this moment I felt a light hand placed\r\n      upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable\r\n      _whisper_ within my ear.\r\n\r\n      In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who\r\n      had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar.\r\n      He was attired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether\r\n      similar to my own; wearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt\r\n      about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier. A mask\r\n      of black silk entirely covered his face.\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cScoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every\r\n      syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, \xe2\x80\x9cscoundrel!\r\n      impostor! accursed villain! you shall not\xe2\x80\x94you shall not dog me\r\n      unto death! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\n      broke my way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber\r\n      adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.\r\n\r\n      Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered\r\n      against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and\r\n      commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then,\r\n      with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his\r\n      defence.\r\n\r\n      The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of\r\n      wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and\r\n      power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer\r\n      strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy,\r\n      plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and\r\n      through his bosom.\r\n\r\n      At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I\r\n      hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned\r\n      to my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately\r\n      portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the\r\n      spectacle then presented to view? The brief moment in which I\r\n      averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a\r\n      material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end\r\n      of the room. A large mirror,\xe2\x80\x94so at first it seemed to me in my\r\n      confusion\xe2\x80\x94now stood where none had been perceptible before; and,\r\n      as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but\r\n      with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me\r\n      with a feeble and tottering gait.\r\n\r\n      Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\n      Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his\r\n      dissolution. His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them,\r\n      upon the floor. Not a thread in all his raiment\xe2\x80\x94not a line in all\r\n      the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not,\r\n      even in the most absolute identity, mine own!\r\n\r\n      It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could\r\n      have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:\r\n\r\n      _\xe2\x80\x9cYou have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou\r\n      also dead\xe2\x80\x94dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst\r\n      thou exist\xe2\x80\x94and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine\r\n      own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TELL-TALE HEART.\r\n\r\n\r\n      True!\xe2\x80\x94nervous\xe2\x80\x94very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am;\r\n      but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my\r\n      senses\xe2\x80\x94not destroyed\xe2\x80\x94not dulled them. Above all was the sense of\r\n      hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.\r\n      I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and\r\n      observe how healthily\xe2\x80\x94how calmly I can tell you the whole story.\r\n\r\n      It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but\r\n      once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was\r\n      none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never\r\n      wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no\r\n      desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye\r\n      of a vulture\xe2\x80\x94a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it\r\n      fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees\xe2\x80\x94very\r\n      gradually\xe2\x80\x94I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and\r\n      thus rid myself of the eye forever.\r\n\r\n      Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But\r\n      you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I\r\n      proceeded\xe2\x80\x94with what caution\xe2\x80\x94with what foresight\xe2\x80\x94with what\r\n      dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man\r\n      than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night,\r\n      about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\n      so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my\r\n      head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light\r\n      shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have\r\n      laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it\r\n      slowly\xe2\x80\x94very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old\r\n      man\xe2\x80\x99s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the\r\n      opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.\r\n      Ha!\xe2\x80\x94would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my\r\n      head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously\xe2\x80\x94oh, so\r\n      cautiously\xe2\x80\x94cautiously (for the hinges creaked)\xe2\x80\x94I undid it just so\r\n      much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I\r\n      did for seven long nights\xe2\x80\x94every night just at midnight\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\n      found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the\r\n      work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.\r\n      And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the\r\n      chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a\r\n      hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you\r\n      see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to\r\n      suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him\r\n      while he slept.\r\n\r\n      Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening\r\n      the door. A watch\xe2\x80\x99s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.\r\n      Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers\xe2\x80\x94of\r\n      my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To\r\n      think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and\r\n      he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly\r\n      chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on\r\n      the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew\r\n      back\xe2\x80\x94but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick\r\n      darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of\r\n      robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the\r\n      door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.\r\n\r\n      I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my\r\n      thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up\r\n      in bed, crying out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not\r\n      move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down.\r\n      He was still sitting up in the bed listening;\xe2\x80\x94just as I have\r\n      done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the\r\n      wall.\r\n\r\n      Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of\r\n      mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief\xe2\x80\x94oh, no!\xe2\x80\x94it\r\n      was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul\r\n      when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night,\r\n      just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from\r\n      my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that\r\n      distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man\r\n      felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that\r\n      he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when\r\n      he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing\r\n      upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could\r\n      not. He had been saying to himself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing but the wind in\r\n      the chimney\xe2\x80\x94it is only a mouse crossing the floor,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\n      merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, he had been\r\n      trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had\r\n      found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him\r\n      had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the\r\n      victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived\r\n      shadow that caused him to feel\xe2\x80\x94although he neither saw nor\r\n      heard\xe2\x80\x94to feel the presence of my head within the room.\r\n\r\n      When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing\r\n      him lie down, I resolved to open a little\xe2\x80\x94a very, very little\r\n      crevice in the lantern. So I opened it\xe2\x80\x94you cannot imagine how\r\n      stealthily, stealthily\xe2\x80\x94until, at length a simple dim ray, like\r\n      the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full\r\n      upon the vulture eye.\r\n\r\n      It was open\xe2\x80\x94wide, wide open\xe2\x80\x94and I grew furious as I gazed upon\r\n      it. I saw it with perfect distinctness\xe2\x80\x94all a dull blue, with a\r\n      hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones;\r\n      but I could see nothing else of the old man\xe2\x80\x99s face or person: for\r\n      I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the\r\n      damned spot.\r\n\r\n      And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but\r\n      over-acuteness of the sense?\xe2\x80\x94now, I say, there came to my ears a\r\n      low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in\r\n      cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the\r\n      old man\xe2\x80\x99s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum\r\n      stimulates the soldier into courage.\r\n\r\n      But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I\r\n      held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could\r\n      maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the\r\n      heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and\r\n      louder every instant. The old man\xe2\x80\x99s terror must have been\r\n      extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!\xe2\x80\x94do you mark\r\n      me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at\r\n      the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old\r\n      house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable\r\n      terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still.\r\n      But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must\r\n      burst. And now a new anxiety seized me\xe2\x80\x94the sound would be heard\r\n      by a neighbour! The old man\xe2\x80\x99s hour had come! With a loud yell, I\r\n      threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked\r\n      once\xe2\x80\x94once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and\r\n      pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the\r\n      deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a\r\n      muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be\r\n      heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was\r\n      dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was\r\n      stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it\r\n      there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead.\r\n      His eye would trouble me no more.\r\n\r\n      If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I\r\n      describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the\r\n      body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.\r\n      First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the\r\n      arms and the legs.\r\n\r\n      I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and\r\n      deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards\r\n      so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye\xe2\x80\x94not even his\xe2\x80\x94could\r\n      have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out\xe2\x80\x94no\r\n      stain of any kind\xe2\x80\x94no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for\r\n      that. A tub had caught all\xe2\x80\x94ha! ha!\r\n\r\n      When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94still\r\n      dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a\r\n      knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light\r\n      heart,\xe2\x80\x94for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who\r\n      introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the\r\n      police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night;\r\n      suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been\r\n      lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been\r\n      deputed to search the premises.\r\n\r\n      I smiled,\xe2\x80\x94for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome.\r\n      The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I\r\n      mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over\r\n      the house. I bade them search\xe2\x80\x94search well. I led them, at length,\r\n      to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.\r\n      In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the\r\n      room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I\r\n      myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own\r\n      seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the\r\n      victim.\r\n\r\n      The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was\r\n      singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they\r\n      chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting\r\n      pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing\r\n      in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing\r\n      became more distinct:\xe2\x80\x94it continued and became more distinct: I\r\n      talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued\r\n      and gained definiteness\xe2\x80\x94until, at length, I found that the noise\r\n      was not within my ears.\r\n\r\n      No doubt I now grew _very_ pale;\xe2\x80\x94but I talked more fluently, and\r\n      with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased\xe2\x80\x94and what could I\r\n      do? It was a low, dull, quick sound\xe2\x80\x94much such a sound as a watch\r\n      makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath\xe2\x80\x94and yet the\r\n      officers heard it not. I talked more quickly\xe2\x80\x94more vehemently; but\r\n      the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles,\r\n      in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise\r\n      steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor\r\n      to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the\r\n      observations of the men\xe2\x80\x94but the noise steadily increased. Oh God!\r\n      what could I do? I foamed\xe2\x80\x94I raved\xe2\x80\x94I swore! I swung the chair upon\r\n      which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the\r\n      noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew\r\n      louder\xe2\x80\x94louder\xe2\x80\x94louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and\r\n      smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!\xe2\x80\x94no, no!\r\n      They heard!\xe2\x80\x94they suspected!\xe2\x80\x94they knew!\xe2\x80\x94they were making a mockery\r\n      of my horror!\xe2\x80\x94this I thought, and this I think. But anything was\r\n      better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this\r\n      derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I\r\n      felt that I must scream or die! and now\xe2\x80\x94again!\xe2\x80\x94hark! louder!\r\n      louder! louder! _louder!_\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cVillains!\xe2\x80\x9d I shrieked, \xe2\x80\x9cdissemble no more!

The wretchedness of earth is multiform.\r\n      Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as\r\n      various as the hues of that arch\xe2\x80\x94as distinct too, yet as\r\n      intimately blended. Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow!\r\n      How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of\r\n      unloveliness?\xe2\x80\x94from the covenant of peace, a simile of sorrow? But\r\n      as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of\r\n      joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the\r\n      anguish of to-day, or the agonies which _are_, have their origin\r\n      in the ecstasies which _might have been_.\r\n\r\n      My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not\r\n      mention. Yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored\r\n      than my gloomy, gray, hereditary halls. Our line has been called\r\n      a race of visionaries; and in many striking particulars\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\n      character of the family mansion\xe2\x80\x94in the frescos of the chief\r\n      saloon\xe2\x80\x94in the tapestries of the dormitories\xe2\x80\x94in the chiselling of\r\n      some buttresses in the armory\xe2\x80\x94but more especially in the gallery\r\n      of antique paintings\xe2\x80\x94in the fashion of the library chamber\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\n      lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      contents\xe2\x80\x94there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the\r\n      belief.\r\n\r\n      The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that\r\n      chamber, and with its volumes\xe2\x80\x94of which latter I will say no more.\r\n      Here died my mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness\r\n      to say that I had not lived before\xe2\x80\x94that the soul has no previous\r\n      existence. You deny it?\xe2\x80\x94let us not argue the matter. Convinced\r\n      myself, I seek not to convince. There is, however, a remembrance\r\n      of aerial forms\xe2\x80\x94of spiritual and meaning eyes\xe2\x80\x94of sounds, musical\r\n      yet sad\xe2\x80\x94a remembrance which will not be excluded; a memory like a\r\n      shadow\xe2\x80\x94vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow,\r\n      too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the\r\n      sunlight of my reason shall exist.\r\n\r\n      In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of\r\n      what seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very\r\n      regions of fairy land\xe2\x80\x94into a palace of imagination\xe2\x80\x94into the wild\r\n      dominions of monastic thought and erudition\xe2\x80\x94it is not singular\r\n      that I gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\n      loitered away my boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in\r\n      reverie; but it _is_ singular that as years rolled away, and the\r\n      noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers\xe2\x80\x94it\r\n      _is_ wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my\r\n      life\xe2\x80\x94wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character\r\n      of my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me\r\n      as visions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land\r\n      of dreams became, in turn, not the material of my every-day\r\n      existence, but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in\r\n      itself.\r\n\r\n      Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my\r\n      paternal halls. Yet differently we grew\xe2\x80\x94I, ill of health, and\r\n      buried in gloom\xe2\x80\x94she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with\r\n      energy; hers, the ramble on the hill-side\xe2\x80\x94mine the studies of the\r\n      cloister; I, living within my own heart, and addicted, body and\r\n      soul, to the most intense and painful meditation\xe2\x80\x94she, roaming\r\n      carelessly through life, with no thought of the shadows in her\r\n      path, or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours. Berenice!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n      call upon her name\xe2\x80\x94Berenice!\xe2\x80\x94and from the gray ruins of memory a\r\n      thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound! Ah,\r\n      vividly is her image before me now, as in the early days of her\r\n      light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic beauty! Oh,\r\n      sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its\r\n      fountains! And then\xe2\x80\x94then all is mystery and terror, and a tale\r\n      which should not be told. Disease\xe2\x80\x94a fatal disease, fell like the\r\n      simoon upon her frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the\r\n      spirit of change swept over her, pervading her mind, her habits,\r\n      and her character, and, in a manner the most subtle and terrible,\r\n      disturbing even the identity of her person! Alas! the destroyer\r\n      came and went!\xe2\x80\x94and the victim\xe2\x80\x94where is she? I knew her not\xe2\x80\x94or\r\n      knew her no longer as Berenice.\r\n\r\n      Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal\r\n      and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind\r\n      in the moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as\r\n      the most distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of\r\n      epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in _trance_ itself\xe2\x80\x94trance\r\n      very nearly resembling positive dissolution, and from which her\r\n      manner of recovery was in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In\r\n      the mean time my own disease\xe2\x80\x94for I have been told that I should\r\n      call it by no other appellation\xe2\x80\x94my own disease, then, grew\r\n      rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a\r\n      novel and extraordinary form\xe2\x80\x94hourly and momently gaining\r\n      vigor\xe2\x80\x94and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible\r\n      ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it, consisted in a\r\n      morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in\r\n      metaphysical science termed the _attentive_. It is more than\r\n      probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is\r\n      in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general\r\n      reader, an adequate idea of that nervous _intensity of interest_\r\n      with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not to speak\r\n      technically) busied and buried themselves, in the contemplation\r\n      of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.\r\n\r\n      To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to\r\n      some frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a\r\n      book; to become absorbed, for the better part of a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day,\r\n      in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the\r\n      floor; to lose myself, for an entire night, in watching the\r\n      steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a fire; to dream away\r\n      whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat, monotonously,\r\n      some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent\r\n      repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to\r\n      lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of\r\n      absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in:\r\n      such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries\r\n      induced by a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed,\r\n      altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to\r\n      anything like analysis or explanation.\r\n\r\n      Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid\r\n      attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous,\r\n      must not be confounded in character with that ruminating\r\n      propensity common to all mankind, and more especially indulged in\r\n      by persons of ardent imagination. It was not even, as might be at\r\n      first supposed, an extreme condition, or exaggeration of such\r\n      propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct and different.\r\n      In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested\r\n      by an object usually _not_ frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight\r\n      of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions\r\n      issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day-dream _often\r\n      replete with luxury_, he finds the _incitamentum_, or first cause\r\n      of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the\r\n      primary object was _invariably frivolous_, although assuming,\r\n      through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and\r\n      unreal importance. Few deductions, if any, were made; and those\r\n      few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a\r\n      centre. The meditations were _never_ pleasurable; and, at the\r\n      termination of the reverie, the first cause, so far from being\r\n      out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated\r\n      interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In a\r\n      word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with\r\n      me, as I have said before, the _attentive_, and are, with the\r\n      day-dreamer, the _speculative_.\r\n\r\n      My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to\r\n      irritate the disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in\r\n      their imaginative and inconsequential nature, of the\r\n      characteristic qualities of the disorder itself. I well remember,\r\n      among others, the treatise of the noble Italian, Coelius Secundus\r\n      Curio, \xe2\x80\x9c_De Amplitudine Beati Regni Dei;_\xe2\x80\x9d St. Austin\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\n      work, the \xe2\x80\x9cCity of God;\xe2\x80\x9d and Tertullian\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c_De Carne Christi_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      in which the paradoxical sentence \xe2\x80\x9c_Mortuus est Dei filius;\r\n      credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum est\r\n      quia impossibile est,_\xe2\x80\x9d occupied my undivided time, for many\r\n      weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation.\r\n\r\n      Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial\r\n      things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of\r\n      by Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of\r\n      human violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds,\r\n      trembled only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And\r\n      although, to a careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond\r\n      doubt, that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the\r\n      _moral_ condition of Berenice, would afford me many objects for\r\n      the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature\r\n      I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such was not in\r\n      any degree the case. In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her\r\n      calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that\r\n      total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fail to\r\n      ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-working means by\r\n      which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to\r\n      pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my\r\n      disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar\r\n      circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own\r\n      character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more\r\n      startling changes wrought in the _physical_ frame of Berenice\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n      the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal\r\n      identity.\r\n\r\n      During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely\r\n      I had never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence,\r\n      feelings with me, _had never been_ of the heart, and my passions\r\n      _always were_ of the mind. Through the gray of the early\r\n      morning\xe2\x80\x94among the trellised shadows of the forest at noonday\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n      in the silence of my library at night\xe2\x80\x94she had flitted by my eyes,\r\n      and I had seen her\xe2\x80\x94not as the living and breathing Berenice, but\r\n      as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being of the earth, earthy,\r\n      but as the abstraction of such a being; not as a thing to admire,\r\n      but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as the theme of the\r\n      most abstruse although desultory speculation. And _now_\xe2\x80\x94now I\r\n      shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet,\r\n      bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to\r\n      mind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke\r\n      to her of marriage.\r\n\r\n      And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when,\r\n      upon an afternoon in the winter of the year\xe2\x80\x94one of those\r\n      unseasonably warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of\r\n      the beautiful Halcyon (*1),\xe2\x80\x94I sat, (and sat, as I thought,\r\n      alone,) in the inner apartment of the library. But, uplifting my\r\n      eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before me.\r\n\r\n      Was it my own excited imagination\xe2\x80\x94or the misty influence of the\r\n      atmosphere\xe2\x80\x94or the uncertain twilight of the chamber\xe2\x80\x94or the gray\r\n      draperies which fell around her figure\xe2\x80\x94that caused in it so\r\n      vacillating and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She\r\n      spoke no word; and I\xe2\x80\x94not for worlds could I have uttered a\r\n      syllable. An icy chill ran through my frame; a sense of\r\n      insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded\r\n      my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I remained for some\r\n      time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her\r\n      person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige\r\n      of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My\r\n      burning glances at length fell upon the face.\r\n\r\n      The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and\r\n      the once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the\r\n      hollow temples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow,\r\n      and jarring discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the\r\n      reigning melancholy of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless,\r\n      and lustreless, and seemingly pupilless, and I shrank\r\n      involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the\r\n      thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a smile of peculiar\r\n      meaning, _the teeth_ of the changed Berenice disclosed themselves\r\n      slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them, or\r\n      that, having done so, I had died!\r\n\r\n      The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found\r\n      that my cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the\r\n      disordered chamber of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and\r\n      would not be driven away, the white and ghastly _spectrum_ of the\r\n      teeth. Not a speck on their surface\xe2\x80\x94not a shade on their\r\n      enamel\xe2\x80\x94not an indenture in their edges\xe2\x80\x94but what that period of\r\n      her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory. I saw them\r\n      _now_ even more unequivocally than I beheld them _then_. The\r\n      teeth!\xe2\x80\x94the teeth!\xe2\x80\x94they were here, and there, and everywhere, and\r\n      visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and excessively\r\n      white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the very\r\n      moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full\r\n      fury of my _monomania_, and I struggled in vain against its\r\n      strange and irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of\r\n      the external world I had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these\r\n      I longed with a phrenzied desire. All other matters and all\r\n      different interests became absorbed in their single\r\n      contemplation. They\xe2\x80\x94they alone were present to the mental eye,\r\n      and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my\r\n      mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every\r\n      attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their\r\n      peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon\r\n      the alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them\r\n      in imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when\r\n      unassisted by the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of\r\n      Mademoiselle Salle it has been well said, \xe2\x80\x9c_Que tous ses pas\r\n      etaient des sentiments_,\xe2\x80\x9d and of Berenice I more seriously\r\n      believed _que toutes ses dents etaient des id\xc3\xa9es_. _Des\r\n      id\xc3\xa9es!_\xe2\x80\x94ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me! _Des\r\n      id\xc3\xa9es!_\xe2\x80\x94ah, _therefore_ it was that I coveted them so madly! I\r\n      felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace,\r\n      in giving me back to reason.\r\n\r\n      And the evening closed in upon me thus\xe2\x80\x94and then the darkness\r\n      came, and tarried, and went\xe2\x80\x94and the day again dawned\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\n      mists of a second night were now gathering around\xe2\x80\x94and still I sat\r\n      motionless in that solitary room\xe2\x80\x94and still I sat buried in\r\n      meditation\xe2\x80\x94and still the _phantasma_ of the teeth maintained its\r\n      terrible ascendancy, as, with the most vivid hideous\r\n      distinctness, it floated about amid the changing lights and\r\n      shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my dreams a\r\n      cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,\r\n      succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many\r\n      low moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and\r\n      throwing open one of the doors of the library, saw standing out\r\n      in the ante-chamber a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me\r\n      that Berenice was\xe2\x80\x94no more! She had been seized with epilepsy in\r\n      the early morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, the\r\n      grave was ready for its tenant, and all the preparations for the\r\n      burial were completed.\r\n\r\n      I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there\r\n      alone. It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and\r\n      exciting dream. I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well\r\n      aware, that since the setting of the sun, Berenice had been\r\n      interred. But of that dreary period which intervened I had no\r\n      positive, at least no definite comprehension. Yet its memory was\r\n      replete with horror\xe2\x80\x94horror more horrible from being vague, and\r\n      terror more terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful page in the\r\n      record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous, and\r\n      unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in\r\n      vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound,\r\n      the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be\r\n      ringing in my ears. I had done a deed\xe2\x80\x94what was it? I asked myself\r\n      the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber\r\n      answered me,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_What was it?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little\r\n      box. It was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it\r\n      frequently before, for it was the property of the family\r\n      physician; but how came it _there_, upon my table, and why did I\r\n      shudder in regarding it? These things were in no manner to be\r\n      accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of\r\n      a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words were the\r\n      singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Dicebant mihi\r\n      sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum\r\n      fore levatas_.\xe2\x80\x9d Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my\r\n      head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become\r\n      congealed within my veins?\r\n\r\n      There came a light tap at the library door\xe2\x80\x94and, pale as the\r\n      tenant of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were\r\n      wild with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky,\r\n      and very low. What said he?\xe2\x80\x94some broken sentences I heard. He\r\n      told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\n      gathering together of the household\xe2\x80\x94of a search in the direction\r\n      of the sound; and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he\r\n      whispered me of a violated grave\xe2\x80\x94of a disfigured body enshrouded,\r\n      yet still breathing\xe2\x80\x94still palpitating\xe2\x80\x94_still alive_!\r\n\r\n      He pointed to garments;\xe2\x80\x94they were muddy and clotted with gore. I\r\n      spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented\r\n      with the impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some\r\n      object against the wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was\r\n      a spade. With a shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the\r\n      box that lay upon it. But I could not force it open; and in my\r\n      tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell heavily, and burst\r\n      into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there rolled out\r\n      some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with thirty-two\r\n      small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered to\r\n      and fro about the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEONORA\r\n\r\n\r\n     Sub conservatione form\xc3\xa6 specific\xc3\xa6 salva anima.\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x94_Raymond Lully_.\r\n\r\n      I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of\r\n      passion. Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet\r\n      settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest\r\n      intelligence\xe2\x80\x94whether much that is glorious\xe2\x80\x94whether all that is\r\n      profound\xe2\x80\x94does not spring from disease of thought\xe2\x80\x94from moods of\r\n      mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who\r\n      dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who\r\n      dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses\r\n      of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have\r\n      been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn\r\n      something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere\r\n      knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless\r\n      or compassless into the vast ocean of the \xe2\x80\x9clight ineffable,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n      again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer, \xe2\x80\x9cagressi\r\n      sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there\r\n      are two distinct conditions of my mental existence\xe2\x80\x94the condition\r\n      of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the\r\n      memory of events forming the first epoch of my life\xe2\x80\x94and a\r\n      condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and\r\n      to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of\r\n      my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period,\r\n      believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give only\r\n      such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt\r\n      it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.\r\n\r\n      She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and\r\n      distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only\r\n      sister of my mother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my\r\n      cousin. We had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun,\r\n      in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep\r\n      ever came upon that vale; for it lay away up among a range of\r\n      giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the\r\n      sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path was trodden in its\r\n      vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting\r\n      back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees,\r\n      and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant\r\n      flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing of\r\n      the world without the valley\xe2\x80\x94I, and my cousin, and her mother.\r\n\r\n      From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our\r\n      encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river,\r\n      brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding\r\n      stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length,\r\n      through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those\r\n      whence it had issued. We called it the \xe2\x80\x9cRiver of Silence\xe2\x80\x9d; for\r\n      there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow. No murmur\r\n      arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the\r\n      pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its\r\n      bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each\r\n      in its own old station, shining on gloriously forever.\r\n\r\n      The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that\r\n      glided through devious ways into its channel, as well as the\r\n      spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths\r\n      of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the\r\n      bottom,\xe2\x80\x94these spots, not less than the whole surface of the\r\n      valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were\r\n      carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even,\r\n      and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the\r\n      yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the\r\n      ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts\r\n      in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.\r\n\r\n      And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like\r\n      wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall\r\n      slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully toward\r\n      the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley.\r\n      Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of\r\n      ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of\r\n      Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves\r\n      that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying\r\n      with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of\r\n      Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.\r\n\r\n      Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with\r\n      Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one\r\n      evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the\r\n      fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s embrace,\r\n      beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water\r\n      of the River of Silence at our images therein. We spoke no words\r\n      during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon the\r\n      morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the God Eros from\r\n      that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the\r\n      fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for\r\n      centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies\r\n      for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a\r\n      delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A\r\n      change fell upon all things. Strange, brilliant flowers,\r\n      star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been\r\n      known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when,\r\n      one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in\r\n      place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And life\r\n      arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with\r\n      all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.\r\n      The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of\r\n      which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length,\r\n      into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of\r\n      \xc3\x86olus\xe2\x80\x94sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too,\r\n      a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of\r\n      Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and\r\n      settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower,\r\n      until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning\r\n      all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if\r\n      forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.\r\n\r\n      The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was\r\n      a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among\r\n      the flowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated\r\n      her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we\r\n      walked together in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and\r\n      discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place\r\n      therein.\r\n\r\n      At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad\r\n      change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only\r\n      upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our\r\n      converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same\r\n      images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive\r\n      variation of phrase.\r\n\r\n      She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom\xe2\x80\x94that,\r\n      like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only\r\n      to die; but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a\r\n      consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at twilight,\r\n      by the banks of the River of Silence. She grieved to think that,\r\n      having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I\r\n      would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love\r\n      which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer\r\n      and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly\r\n      at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to\r\n      Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any\r\n      daughter of Earth\xe2\x80\x94that I would in no manner prove recreant to her\r\n      dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which\r\n      she had blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe\r\n      to witness the pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I\r\n      invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove\r\n      traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding\r\n      great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it\r\n      here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words;\r\n      and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her\r\n      breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made\r\n      acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it\r\n      made easy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not\r\n      many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I\r\n      had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in\r\n      that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her\r\n      return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this\r\n      thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise,\r\n      that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her\r\n      presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the\r\n      air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.\r\n      And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent\r\n      life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.\r\n\r\n      Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in\r\n      Time\xe2\x80\x99s path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with\r\n      the second era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over\r\n      my brain, and I mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But\r\n      let me on.\xe2\x80\x94Years dragged themselves along heavily, and still I\r\n      dwelled within the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass; but a second\r\n      change had come upon all things. The star-shaped flowers shrank\r\n      into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more. The tints of\r\n      the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels\r\n      withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten,\r\n      dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever\r\n      encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the\r\n      tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us,\r\n      but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay\r\n      glowing birds that had arrived in his company. And the golden and\r\n      silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our\r\n      domain and bedecked the sweet river never again. And the lulling\r\n      melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of \xc3\x86olus, and more\r\n      divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it died little by\r\n      little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the stream\r\n      returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its original\r\n      silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and,\r\n      abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell\r\n      back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold\r\n      golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored\r\n      Grass.\r\n\r\n      Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the\r\n      sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams\r\n      of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at\r\n      lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my\r\n      brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs\r\n      filled often the night air, and once\xe2\x80\x94oh, but once only! I was\r\n      awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the\r\n      pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.\r\n\r\n      But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I\r\n      longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At\r\n      length the valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and\r\n      I left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of\r\n      the world.\r\n\r\n      I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have\r\n      served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed\r\n      so long in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and\r\n      pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and\r\n      the radiant loveliness of women, bewildered and intoxicated my\r\n      brain. But as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the\r\n      indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given me in\r\n      the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations they\r\n      ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood\r\n      aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible\r\n      temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far\r\n      distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I\r\n      served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded\r\n      at once\xe2\x80\x94at whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in\r\n      the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love. What,\r\n      indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in\r\n      comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the\r\n      spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my\r\n      whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?\xe2\x80\x94Oh,\r\n      bright was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had\r\n      room for none other. Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as\r\n      I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought\r\n      only of them\xe2\x80\x94and of her.\r\n\r\n      I wedded\xe2\x80\x94nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness\r\n      was not visited upon me. And once\xe2\x80\x94but once again in the silence\r\n      of the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which\r\n      had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and\r\n      sweet voice, saying:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cSleep in peace! for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and,\r\n      in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art\r\n      absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in\r\n      Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE SECOND VOLUME\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes \xe2\x80\x94 Scheherazade\r\n\r\n      (*1) The coralites.\r\n\r\n      (*2) \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is\r\n      a petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists\r\n      of several hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to\r\n      stone. Some trees, now growing, are partly petrified. This is a\r\n      startling fact for natural philosophers, and must cause them to\r\n      modify the existing theory of petrification.\xe2\x80\x94_Kennedy_.\r\n\r\n      This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated\r\n      by the discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head\r\n      waters of the Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in\r\n      the Black Hills of the rocky chain.\r\n\r\n      There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the\r\n      globe more remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque\r\n      point of view than that presented by the petrified forest, near\r\n      Cairo. The traveller, having passed the tombs of the caliphs,\r\n      just beyond the gates of the city, proceeds to the southward,\r\n      nearly at right angles to the road across the desert to Suez, and\r\n      after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren valley,\r\n      covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as if the tide\r\n      had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills,\r\n      which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene\r\n      now presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate.\r\n      A mass of fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when\r\n      struck by his horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to\r\n      extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the form of a\r\n      decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue,\r\n      but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to\r\n      fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in\r\n      thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye can\r\n      reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way\r\n      through amongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or\r\n      Ireland, it might pass without remark for some enormous drained\r\n      bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots\r\n      and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect,\r\n      and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily\r\n      recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the\r\n      finer portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire,\r\n      and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers. The whole\r\n      are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are capable\r\n      of receiving the highest polish.\xe2\x80\x94 _Asiatic Magazine_.\r\n\r\n      (*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.\r\n\r\n      (*4) In Iceland, 1783.\r\n\r\n      (*5) \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind\r\n      produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is\r\n      more than fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find\r\n      their way by groping.

But the\r\n      stamens, being shorter than the germen, cannot discharge the\r\n      pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the flower stands\r\n      always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without some\r\n      additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down\r\n      to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has\r\n      furnished in this case, is that of the _Tiputa Pennicornis_, a\r\n      small insect, which entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of\r\n      honey, descends to the bottom, and rummages about till it becomes\r\n      quite covered with pollen; but not being able to force its way\r\n      out again, owing to the downward position of the hairs, which\r\n      converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap, and being\r\n      somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and\r\n      forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing\r\n      the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its\r\n      impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to\r\n      droop, and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube,\r\n      effecting an easy passage for the escape of the insect.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Rev.

There were a thousand futile attempts to answer the query on\r\n      the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and when at\r\n      length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that the\r\n      wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since\r\n      the first bird had traversed the air.\r\n\r\n      (*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort\r\n      and the Indian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took\r\n      up four hours in passing, which, at the rate of one mile per\r\n      minute, gives a length of 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons\r\n      to each square yard, gives 2,230,272,000 Pigeons.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Travels in\r\n      Canada and the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d by Lieut.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
