    <h2>
      AUTHOR'S PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i> was begun in a weekly paper in 1881, and was
      continued in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906. In that year a
      large part of it was published in covers with the title <i>The Cynic's
      Word Book</i>, a name which the author had not the power to reject or
      happiness to approve. To quote the publishers of the present work:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by the
      religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the work had
      appeared, with the natural consequence that when it came out in covers the
      country already had been flooded by its imitators with a score of 'cynic'
      books&mdash;<i>The Cynic's This</i>, <i>The Cynic's That</i>, and <i>The
      Cynic's t'Other</i>. Most of these books were merely stupid, though some
      of them added the distinction of silliness. Among them, they brought the
      word 'cynic' into disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was
      discredited in advance of publication."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, too, some of the enterprising humorists of the country had
      helped themselves to such parts of the work as served their needs, and
      many of its definitions, anecdotes, phrases and so forth, had become more
      or less current in popular speech. This explanation is made, not with any
      pride of priority in trifles, but in simple denial of possible charges of
      plagiarism, which is no trifle. In merely resuming his own the author
      hopes to be held guiltless by those to whom the work is addressed&mdash;enlightened
      souls who prefer dry wines to sweet, sense to sentiment, wit to humor and
      clean English to slang.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conspicuous, and it is hoped not unpleasant, feature of the book is its
      abundant illustrative quotations from eminent poets, chief of whom is that
      learned and ingenius cleric, Father Gassalasca Jape, S.J., whose lines
      bear his initials. To Father Jape's kindly encouragement and assistance
      the author of the prose text is greatly indebted.

    <h1>
      A
    </h1>
    <p>
      ABASEMENT, n. A decent and customary mental attitude in the presence of
      wealth or power. Peculiarly appropriate in an employee when addressing an
      employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABATIS, n. Rubbish in front of a fort, to prevent the rubbish outside from
      molesting the rubbish inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABDICATION, n. An act whereby a sovereign attests his sense of the high
      temperature of the throne.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Poor Isabella's Dead, whose abdication
  Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish nation.
  For that performance 'twere unfair to scold her:
  She wisely left a throne too hot to hold her.
  To History she'll be no royal riddle&mdash;
  Merely a plain parched pea that jumped the griddle.
</pre>
    <p>
      G.J.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABDOMEN, n. The temple of the god Stomach, in whose worship, with
      sacrificial rights, all true men engage. From women this ancient faith
      commands but a stammering assent. They sometimes minister at the altar in
      a half-hearted and ineffective way, but true reverence for the one deity
      that men really adore they know not. If woman had a free hand in the
      world's marketing the race would become graminivorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABILITY, n. The natural equipment to accomplish some small part of the
      meaner ambitions distinguishing able men from dead ones. In the last
      analysis ability is commonly found to consist mainly in a high degree of
      solemnity. Perhaps, however, this impressive quality is rightly appraised;
      it is no easy task to be solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABNORMAL, adj. Not conforming to standard. In matters of thought and
      conduct, to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal is to be
      detested. Wherefore the lexicographer adviseth a striving toward the
      straiter [sic] resemblance of the Average Man than he hath to himself.
      Whoso attaineth thereto shall have peace, the prospect of death and the
      hope of Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABORIGINIES, n. Persons of little worth found cumbering the soil of a
      newly discovered country. They soon cease to cumber; they fertilize.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABRACADABRA.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  By <i>Abracadabra</i> we signify
      An infinite number of things.
  'Tis the answer to What? and How? and Why?
  And Whence? and Whither?&mdash;a word whereby
      The Truth (with the comfort it brings)
  Is open to all who grope in night,
  Crying for Wisdom's holy light.

  Whether the word is a verb or a noun
      Is knowledge beyond my reach.
  I only know that 'tis handed down.
          From sage to sage,
          From age to age&mdash;
      An immortal part of speech!

  Of an ancient man the tale is told
  That he lived to be ten centuries old,
      In a cave on a mountain side.
      (True, he finally died.)
  The fame of his wisdom filled the land,
  For his head was bald, and you'll understand
      His beard was long and white
      And his eyes uncommonly bright.

  Philosophers gathered from far and near
  To sit at his feet and hear and hear,
          Though he never was heard
          To utter a word
      But "<i>Abracadabra, abracadab</i>,
          <i>Abracada, abracad</i>,
      <i>Abraca, abrac, abra, ab!</i>"
          'Twas all he had,
  'Twas all they wanted to hear, and each
  Made copious notes of the mystical speech,
          Which they published next&mdash;
          A trickle of text
  In a meadow of commentary.
      Mighty big books were these,
      In number, as leaves of trees;
  In learning, remarkable&mdash;very!

          He's dead,
          As I said,
  And the books of the sages have perished,
  But his wisdom is sacredly cherished.
  In <i>Abracadabra</i> it solemnly rings,
  Like an ancient bell that forever swings.
          O, I love to hear
          That word make clear
  Humanity's General Sense of Things.

      Jamrach Holobom
    </p>
    <p>
      ABRIDGE, v.t. To shorten.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for
  people to abridge their king, a decent respect for the opinions of
  mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
  them to the separation.
</pre>
    <p>
      Oliver Cromwell
    </p>
    <p>
      ABRUPT, adj. Sudden, without ceremony, like the arrival of a cannon- shot
      and the departure of the soldier whose interests are most affected by it.
      Dr. Samuel Johnson beautifully said of another author's ideas that they
      were "concatenated without abruption."
    </p>
    <p>
      ABSCOND, v.i. To "move in a mysterious way," commonly with the property of
      another.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Spring beckons!  All things to the call respond;
  The trees are leaving and cashiers abscond.
</pre>
    <p>
      Phela Orm
    </p>
    <p>
      ABSENT, adj. Peculiarly exposed to the tooth of detraction; vilifed;
      hopelessly in the wrong; superseded in the consideration and affection of
      another.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  To men a man is but a mind.  Who cares
  What face he carries or what form he wears?
  But woman's body is the woman.  O,
  Stay thou, my sweetheart, and do never go,
  But heed the warning words the sage hath said:
  A woman absent is a woman dead.
</pre>
    <p>
      Jogo Tyree
    </p>
    <p>
      ABSENTEE, n. A person with an income who has had the forethought to remove
      himself from the sphere of exaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABSOLUTE, adj. Independent, irresponsible. An absolute monarchy is one in
      which the sovereign does as he pleases so long as he pleases the
      assassins. Not many absolute monarchies are left, most of them having been
      replaced by limited monarchies, where the sovereign's power for evil (and
      for good) is greatly curtailed, and by republics, which are governed by
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABSTAINER, n. A weak person who yields to the temptation of denying
      himself a pleasure. A total abstainer is one who abstains from everything
      but abstention, and especially from inactivity in the affairs of others.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Said a man to a crapulent youth:  "I thought
      You a total abstainer, my son."
  "So I am, so I am," said the scapegrace caught&mdash;
      "But not, sir, a bigoted one."
</pre>
    <p>
      G.J.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABSURDITY, n. A statement or belief manifestly inconsistent with one's own
      opinion.

    <p>
      ACCOMPLICE, n. One associated with another in a crime, having guilty
      knowledge and complicity, as an attorney who defends a criminal, knowing
      him guilty. This view of the attorney's position in the matter has not
      hitherto commanded the assent of attorneys, no one having offered them a
      fee for assenting.

      ACCORD, n. Harmony.
    </p>

  Said the Shah:  "I do&mdash;'tis the only kind
      Of ability you possess."
</pre>
    <p>
      Joram Tate
    </p>
    <p>
      ACCUSE, v.t. To affirm another's guilt or unworth; most commonly as a

    </p>
    <p>
      ACEPHALOUS, adj. In the surprising condition of the Crusader who absently
      pulled at his forelock some hours after a Saracen scimitar had,
      unconsciously to him, passed through his neck, as related by de Joinville.
    </p>
    <p>
      ACHIEVEMENT, n. The death of endeavor and the birth of disgust.
    </p>

    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  One day a wag&mdash;what would the wretch be at?&mdash;
  Shifted a letter of the cipher RAT,
  And said it was a god's name!  Straight arose
  Fantastic priests and postulants (with shows,
  And mysteries, and mummeries, and hymns,
  And disputations dire that lamed their limbs)
  To serve his temple and maintain the fires,
  Expound the law, manipulate the wires.
  Amazed, the populace that rites attend,
  Believe whate'er they cannot comprehend,
  And, inly edified to learn that two
  Half-hairs joined so and so (as Art can do)
  Have sweeter values and a grace more fit
  Than Nature's hairs that never have been split,
  Bring cates and wines for sacrificial feasts,
  And sell their garments to support the priests.

      ARTLESSNESS, n. A certain engaging quality to which women attain by long

      ASS, n. A public singer with a good voice but no ear. In Virginia City,
      Nevada, he is called the Washoe Canary, in Dakota, the Senator, and
      everywhere the Donkey. The animal is widely and variously celebrated in
      the literature, art and religion of every age and country; no other so
      engages and fires the human imagination as this noble vertebrate. Indeed,
      it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, <i>lib. II., De Clem.</i>, and C.
      Stantatus, <i>De Temperamente</i>) if it is not a god; and as such we know
      it was worshiped by the Etruscans, and, if we may believe Macrobious, by
      the Cupasians also. Of the only two animals admitted into the Mahometan
      Paradise along with the souls of men, the ass that carried Balaam is one,
      the dog of the Seven Sleepers the other. This is no small distinction.
      From what has been written about this beast might be compiled a library of
      great splendor and magnitude, rivalling that of the Shakespearean cult,
      and that which clusters about the Bible. It may be said, generally, that
      all literature is more or less Asinine.

      BAAL, n. An old deity formerly much worshiped under various names. As Baal
      he was popular with the Phoenicians; as Belus or Bel he had the honor to
      be served by the priest Berosus, who wrote the famous account of the
      Deluge; as Babel he had a tower partly erected to his glory on the Plain
      of Shinar. From Babel comes our English word "babble." Under whatever name
      worshiped, Baal is the Sun-god. As Beelzebub he is the god of flies, which
      are begotten of the sun's rays on the stagnant water. In Physicia Baal is
      still worshiped as Bolus, and as Belly he is adored and served with
      abundant sacrifice by the priests of Guttledom.

      There have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose

      before doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being
      preserved on a floating lotus leaf.

      that had been blinded by lightning as a punishment for having fatally
      gazed on a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved. Juno afterward restored the

                                       Because

  His belly?

              Oh, well, he was starving, my boy&mdash;
  A state in which, doubtless, there's little of joy.

  Was "Bread!" ever "Bread!"

  With little to wear, he had nothing to sell;
  To beg was unlawful&mdash;improper as well.

  Why didn't he work?

                       He would even have done that,
  But men said:  "Get out!" and the State remarked:  "Scat!"
  I mention these incidents merely to show
  That the vengeance he took was uncommonly low.
  Revenge, at the best, is the act of a Siou,
  But for trifles&mdash;

  And tuck out the belly that clung to his back.

      BRAIN, n. An apparatus with which we think what we think. That which
      distinguishes the man who is content to <i>be</i> something from the man
      who wishes to <i>do</i> something. A man of great wealth, or one who has
      been pitchforked into high station, has commonly such a headful of brain
      that his neighbors cannot keep their hats on. In our civilization, and
      under our republican form of government, brain is so highly honored that
      it is rewarded by exemption from the cares of office.

      CARMELITE, n. A mendicant friar of the order of Mount Carmel.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  As Death was a-rising out one day,
  Across Mount Camel he took his way,
      Where he met a mendicant monk,
      Some three or four quarters drunk,
  With a holy leer and a pious grin,
  Ragged and fat and as saucy as sin,
      Who held out his hands and cried:
  "Give, give in Charity's name, I pray.
  Give in the name of the Church.  O give,
  Give that her holy sons may live!"
      And Death replied,
      Smiling long and wide:
      "I'll give, holy father, I'll give thee&mdash;a ride."

      With a rattle and bang
      Of his bones, he sprang
  From his famous Pale Horse, with his spear;
      By the neck and the foot
      Seized the fellow, and put
  Him astride with his face to the rear.

  The Monarch laughed loud with a sound that fell
  Like clods on the coffin's sounding shell:
  "Ho, ho!  A beggar on horseback, they say,
      Will ride to the devil!"&mdash;and <i>thump</i>
      Fell the flat of his dart on the rump
  Of the charger, which galloped away.

  Faster and faster and faster it flew,
  Till the rocks and the flocks and the trees that grew
  By the road were dim and blended and blue
      To the wild, wild eyes
      Of the rider&mdash;in size
      Resembling a couple of blackberry pies.
  Death laughed again, as a tomb might laugh
      At a burial service spoiled,
      And the mourners' intentions foiled
      By the body erecting
      Its head and objecting
  To further proceedings in its behalf.

  Many a year and many a day
  Have passed since these events away.
  The monk has long been a dusty corse,
  And Death has never recovered his horse.
      For the friar got hold of its tail,
      And steered it within the pale
  Of the monastery gray,
  Where the beast was stabled and fed
  With barley and oil and bread
  Till fatter it grew than the fattest friar,
  And so in due course was appointed Prior.

      be improved, however, thus: <i>Cogito cogito ergo cogito sum</i>&mdash; "I

      CENTAUR, n. One of a race of persons who lived before the division of

      followed the primitive economic maxim, "Every man his own horse." The best
      of the lot was Chiron, who to the wisdom and virtues of the horse added

      entrance. Cerberus is known to have had three heads, and some of the poets
      have credited him with as many as a hundred. Professor Graybill, whose
      clerky erudition and profound knowledge of Greek give his opinion great
      weight, has averaged all the estimates, and makes the number twenty-seven&mdash;a

  Then saw I gazing thoughtfully below,
  With tranquil face, upon that holy show
  A tall, spare figure in a robe of white,
  Whose eyes diffused a melancholy light.
  "God keep you, stranger," I exclaimed.  "You are

  And yet I entertain the hope that you,

      CROSS, n. An ancient religious symbol erroneously supposed to owe its
      significance to the most solemn event in the history of Christianity, but
      really antedating it by thousands of years. By many it has been believed
      to be identical with the <i>crux ansata</i> of the ancient phallic
      worship, but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that, to
      the rites of primitive peoples. We have to-day the White Cross as a symbol
      of chastity, and the Red Cross as a badge of benevolent neutrality in war.
      Having in mind the former, the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape smites the

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Be good, be good!" the sisterhood

  And youthful grace and pretty face

      To better our behaving?

      DAMN, v. A word formerly much used by the Paphlagonians, the meaning of
      which is lost. By the learned Dr. Dolabelly Gak it is believed to have
      been a term of satisfaction, implying the highest possible degree of
      mental tranquillity. Professor Groke, on the contrary, thinks it expressed
      an emotion of tumultuous delight, because it so frequently occurs in
      combination with the word <i>jod</i> or <i>god</i>, meaning "joy." It
      would be with great diffidence that I should advance an opinion
      conflicting with that of either of these formidable authorities.

      DANCE, v.i. To leap about to the sound of tittering music, preferably with
      arms about your neighbor's wife or daughter. There are many kinds of

      two characteristics in common: they are conspicuously innocent, and warmly
      loved by the vicious.

      DAWN, n. The time when men of reason go to bed. Certain old men prefer to
      rise at about that time, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty
      stomach, and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to
      these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the
      truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but
      in spite of them. The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing
      is that it has killed all the others who have tried it.

      DULLARD, n. A member of the reigning dynasty in letters and life. The
      Dullards came in with Adam, and being both numerous and sturdy have
      overrun the habitable world. The secret of their power is their
      insensibility to blows; tickle them with a bludgeon and they laugh with a
      platitude. The Dullards came originally from Boeotia, whence they were
      driven by stress of starvation, their dullness having blighted the crops.
      For some centuries they infested Philistia, and many of them are called
      Philistines to this day. In the turbulent times of the Crusades they
      withdrew thence and gradually overspread all Europe, occupying most of the
      high places in politics, art, literature, science and theology. Since a
      detachment of Dullards came over with the Pilgrims in the <i>Mayflower</i>
      and made a favorable report of the country, their increase by birth,
      immigration, and conversion has been rapid and steady. According to the
      most trustworthy statistics the number of adult Dullards in the United
      States is but little short of thirty millions, including the
      statisticians. The intellectual centre of the race is somewhere about
      Peoria, Illinois, but the New England Dullard is the most shockingly

  And we cannot have, when the speaker demands
  To be told how every member stands,
  A man who to all things under the sky
  Assents by eternally voting 'I'."

      ELECTRICITY, n. The power that causes all natural phenomena not known to
      be caused by something else. It is the same thing as lightning, and its
      famous attempt to strike Dr. Franklin is one of the most picturesque
      incidents in that great and good man's career. The memory of Dr. Franklin
      is justly held in great reverence, particularly in France, where a waxen
      effigy of him was recently on exhibition, bearing the following touching
      account of his life and services to science:

      "Monsieur Franqulin, inventor of electricity.  This
  illustrious savant, after having made several voyages around the
  world, died on the Sandwich Islands and was devoured by savages,
  of whom not a single fragment was ever recovered."

  Electricity seems destined to play a most important part in the
arts and industries.  The question of its economical application to
some purposes is still unsettled, but experiment has already proved
that it will propel a street car better than a gas jet and give more
light than a horse.

      ELEGY, n. A composition in verse, in which, without employing any of the

      EMBALM, v.i. To cheat vegetation by locking up the gases upon which it
      feeds. By embalming their dead and thereby deranging the natural balance
      between animal and vegetable life, the Egyptians made their once fertile
      and populous country barren and incapable of supporting more than a meagre
      crew. The modern metallic burial casket is a step in the same direction,
      and many a dead man who ought now to be ornamenting his neighbor's lawn as
      a tree, or enriching his table as a bunch of radishes, is doomed to a long
      inutility. We shall get him after awhile if we are spared, but in the

      Holobom:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      We know better the needs of ourselves than of others.  To
  serve oneself is economy of administration.

      In each human heart are a tiger, a pig, an ass and a
  nightingale.  Diversity of character is due to their unequal
  activity.

      There are three sexes; males, females and girls.

      Beauty in women and distinction in men are alike in this:
  they seem to the unthinking a kind of credibility.
      Women in love are less ashamed than men.  They have less to be
  ashamed of.

      While your friend holds you affectionately by both your hands
  you are safe, for you can watch both his.

      the philosophers themselves could partly understand, and <i>esoteric</i>,
      those that nobody could understand. It is the latter that have most

    <p>
      EVERLASTING, adj. Lasting forever. It is with no small diffidence that I
      venture to offer this brief and elementary definition, for I am not
      unaware of the existence of a bulky volume by a sometime Bishop of
      Worcester, entitled, <i>A Partial Definition of the Word "Everlasting," as
      Used in the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures</i>. His book was
      once esteemed of great authority in the Anglican Church, and is still, I
      understand, studied with pleasure to the mind and profit of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      EXCEPTION, n. A thing which takes the liberty to differ from other things
      of its class, as an honest man, a truthful woman, etc. "The exception
      proves the rule" is an expression constantly upon the lips of the
      ignorant, who parrot it from one another with never a thought of its
      absurdity. In the Latin, "<i>Exceptio probat regulam</i>" means that the
      exception <i>tests</i> the rule, puts it to the proof, not <i>confirms</i>
      it. The malefactor who drew the meaning from this excellent dictum and
      substituted a contrary one of his own exerted an evil power which appears

      Following is an extract from an old book entitled, <i>The Lunarian
      Astonished</i>&mdash;Pfeiffer &amp; Co., Boston, 1803:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  LUNARIAN:  Then when your Congress has passed a law it goes
      directly to the Supreme Court in order that it may at once be
      known whether it is constitutional?
  TERRESTRIAN:  O no; it does not require the approval of the
      Supreme Court until having perhaps been enforced for many
      years somebody objects to its operation against himself&mdash;I
      mean his client.  The President, if he approves it, begins to
      execute it at once.
  LUNARIAN:  Ah, the executive power is a part of the legislative.
      Do your policemen also have to approve the local ordinances
      that they enforce?
  TERRESTRIAN:  Not yet&mdash;at least not in their character of
      constables.  Generally speaking, though, all laws require the
      approval of those whom they are intended to restrain.
  LUNARIAN:  I see.  The death warrant is not valid until signed by
      the murderer.
  TERRESTRIAN:  My friend, you put it too strongly; we are not so
      consistent.
  LUNARIAN:  But this system of maintaining an expensive judicial
      machinery to pass upon the validity of laws only after they
      have long been executed, and then only when brought before the
      court by some private person&mdash;does it not cause great
      confusion?
  TERRESTRIAN:  It does.
  LUNARIAN:  Why then should not your laws, previously to being
      executed, be validated, not by the signature of your
      President, but by that of the Chief Justice of the Supreme
      Court?
  TERRESTRIAN:  There is no precedent for any such course.
  LUNARIAN:  Precedent.  What is that?
  TERRESTRIAN:  It has been defined by five hundred lawyers in three
      volumes each.  So how can any one know?

      FAIRY, n. A creature, variously fashioned and endowed, that formerly
      inhabited the meadows and forests. It was nocturnal in its habits, and
      somewhat addicted to dancing and the theft of children. The fairies are
      now believed by naturalists to be extinct, though a clergyman of the Church
      of England saw three near Colchester as lately as 1855, while passing
      through a park after dining with the lord of the manor. The sight greatly
      staggered him, and he was so affected that his account of it was
      incoherent. In the year 1807 a troop of fairies visited a wood near Aix
      and carried off the daughter of a peasant, who had been seen to enter it
      with a bundle of clothing. The son of a wealthy <i>bourgeois</i>
      disappeared about the same time, but afterward returned. He had seen the
      abduction and been in pursuit of the fairies. Justinian Gaux, a writer of the
      fourteenth century, avers that so great is the fairies' power of
      transformation that he saw one change itself into two opposing armies and
      fight a battle with great slaughter, and that the next day, after it had
      resumed its original shape and gone away, there were seven hundred bodies
      of the slain which the villagers had to bury. He does not say if any of
      the wounded recovered. In the time of Henry III, of England, a law was
      made which prescribed the death penalty for "Kyllynge, wowndynge, or
      mamynge" a fairy, and it was universally respected.

      FEAST, n. A festival. A religious celebration usually signalized by
      gluttony and drunkenness, frequently in honor of some holy person
      distinguished for abstemiousness. In the Roman Catholic Church feasts are
      "movable" and "immovable," but the celebrants are uniformly immovable
      until they are full. In their earliest development these entertainments
      took the form of feasts for the dead; such were held by the Greeks, under
      the name <i>Nemeseia</i>, by the Aztecs and Peruvians, as in modern times
      they are popular with the Chinese; though it is believed that the ancient
      dead, like the modern, were light eaters. Among the many feasts of the

  The Maker, at Creation's birth,
  With living things had stocked the earth.
  From elephants to bats and snails,
  They all were good, for all were males.
  But when the Devil came and saw
  He said:  "By Thine eternal law
  Of growth, maturity, decay,
  These all must quickly pass away
  And leave untenanted the earth
  Unless Thou dost establish birth"&mdash;
  Then tucked his head beneath his wing
  To laugh&mdash;he had no sleeve&mdash;the thing
  With deviltry did so accord,
  That he'd suggested to the Lord.
  The Master pondered this advice,
  Then shook and threw the fateful dice
  Wherewith all matters here below
  Are ordered, and observed the throw;
  Then bent His head in awful state,
  Confirming the decree of Fate.
  From every part of earth anew
  The conscious dust consenting flew,
  While rivers from their courses rolled
  To make it plastic for the mould.
  Enough collected (but no more,
  For niggard Nature hoards her store)
  He kneaded it to flexible clay,
  While Nick unseen threw some away.
  And then the various forms He cast,
  Gross organs first and finer last;
  No one at once evolved, but all
  By even touches grew and small
  Degrees advanced, till, shade by shade,
  To match all living things He'd made
  Females, complete in all their parts
  Except (His clay gave out) the hearts.
  "No matter," Satan cried; "with speed
  I'll fetch the very hearts they need"&mdash;
  So flew away and soon brought back
  The number needed, in a sack.
  That night earth rang with sounds of strife&mdash;
  Ten million males each had a wife;
  That night sweet Peace her pinions spread
  O'er Hell&mdash;ten million devils dead!

      Had been of all her servitors the chief

  Is more than e'er she wore on land or wave.
  No, David served not Naked Truth when he
      Struck that sledge-hammer blow at all his race;
          Nor did he hit the nail upon the head:
  For reason shows that it could never be,

      liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth
      under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out the sense of
      the work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of,
      the writer's powers. The "old masters" of literature&mdash;that is to say,
      the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics
      in the same language&mdash;never punctuated at all, but worked right along
      free-handed, without that abruption of the thought which comes from the
      use of points. (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage
      in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that
      the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of
      development characterizing the infancy of races.) In the work of these
      primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator
      with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by
      the writers' ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly&mdash;<i>Musca
      maledicta</i>. In transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose of
      either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard
      as divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy
      whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable
      enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers
      contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious
      advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such assistance as
      the flies of their own household may be willing to grant, frequently rival
      and sometimes surpass the older compositions, in respect at least of
      punctuation, which is no small glory. Fully to understand the important
      services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a
      page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molasses in
      a sunny room and observe "how the wit brightens and the style refines" in
      accurate proportion to the duration of exposure.

      hand was warmly tucked-in the set sun of civilization, and in the twilight
      he prepares Man's evening meal of milk-and-morality and turns down the
      covers of the universal grave. And after the rest of us shall have retired
      for the night of eternal oblivion he will sit up to write a history of

      FROG, n. A reptile with edible legs. The first mention of frogs in profane
      literature is in Homer's narrative of the war between them and the mice.
      Skeptical persons have doubted Homer's authorship of the work, but the
      learned, ingenious and industrious Dr. Schliemann has set the question
      forever at rest by uncovering the bones of the slain frogs. One of the
      forms of moral suasion by which Pharaoh was besought to favor the
      Israelities was a plague of frogs, but Pharaoh, who liked them <i>fricasees</i>,
      remarked, with truly oriental stoicism, that he could stand it as long as
      the frogs and the Jews could; so the programme was changed. The frog is a
      diligent songster, having a good voice but no ear. The libretto of his
      favorite opera, as written by Aristophanes, is brief, simple and effective&mdash;"brekekex-koax";
      the music is apparently by that eminent composer, Richard Wagner. Horses
      have a frog in each hoof&mdash;a thoughtful provision of nature, enabling

      FRYING-PAN, n. One part of the penal apparatus employed in that punitive

      by him used in cooking span-long infants that had died without baptism;
      and observing one day the horrible torment of a tramp who had incautiously
      pulled a fried babe from the waste-dump and devoured it, it occurred to
      the great divine to rob death of its terrors by introducing the frying-pan
      into every household in Geneva. Thence it spread to all corners of the
      world, and has been of invaluable assistance in the propagation of his
      sombre faith. The following lines (said to be from the pen of his Grace
      Bishop Potter) seem to imply that the usefulness of this utensil is not
      limited to this world; but as the consequences of its employment in this
      life reach over into the life to come, so also itself may be found on the
      other side, rewarding its devotees:

      am able to compile from memories of my own experience.

    <p>
      There is one insuperable obstacle to a belief in ghosts. A ghost never
      comes naked: he appears either in a winding-sheet or "in his habit as he
      lived." To believe in him, then, is to believe that not only have the dead
      the power to make themselves visible after there is nothing left of them,
      but that the same power inheres in textile fabrics. Supposing the products
      of the loom to have this ability, what object would they have in
      exercising it? And why does not the apparition of a suit of clothes
      sometimes walk abroad without a ghost in it? These be riddles of
      significance. They reach away down and get a convulsive grip on the very
      tap-root of this flourishing faith.

      GHOUL, n. A demon addicted to the reprehensible habit of devouring the
      dead. The existence of ghouls has been disputed by that class of
      controversialists who are more concerned to deprive the world of
      comforting beliefs than to give it anything good in their place. In 1640
      Father Secchi saw one in a cemetery near Florence and frightened it away
      with the sign of the cross. He describes it as gifted with many heads and
      an uncommon allowance of limbs, and he saw it in more than one place at a
      time. The good man was coming away from dinner at the time and explains
      that if he had not been "heavy with eating" he would have seized the demon
      at all hazards. Atholston relates that a ghoul was caught by some sturdy
      peasants in a churchyard at Sudbury and ducked in a horsepond. (He appears
      to think that so distinguished a criminal should have been ducked in a
      tank of rosewater.) The water turned at once to blood "and so contynues
      unto ys daye." The pond has since been bled with a ditch. As late as the
      beginning of the fourteenth century a ghoul was cornered in the crypt of
      the cathedral at Amiens and the whole population surrounded the place.
      Twenty armed men with a priest at their head, bearing a crucifix, entered
      and captured the ghoul, which, thinking to escape by the stratagem, had
      transformed itself to the semblance of a well known citizen, but was
      nevertheless hanged, drawn and quartered in the midst of hideous popular
      orgies. The citizen whose shape the demon had assumed was so affected by
      the sinister occurrence that he never again showed himself in Amiens and
      his fate remains a mystery.

      GNOME, n. In North-European mythology, a dwarfish imp inhabiting the
      interior parts of the earth and having special custody of mineral
      treasures. Bjorsen, who died in 1765, says gnomes were common enough in
      the southern parts of Sweden in his boyhood, and he frequently saw them
      scampering on the hills in the evening twilight. Ludwig Binkerhoof saw
      three as recently as 1792, in the Black Forest, and Sneddeker avers that
      in 1803 they drove a party of miners out of a Silesian mine. Basing our

      With brambles 'twas encumbered;
  The winds were moaning in the wood,
      Unheard by him who slumbered,

  A rustic standing near, I said:
      "He cannot hear it blowing!"
  "'Course not," said he:  "the feller's dead&mdash;
      He can't hear nowt [sic] that's going."

  "Too true," I said; "alas, too true&mdash;
      No sound his sense can quicken!"
  "Well, mister, wot is that to you?&mdash;
      The deadster ain't a-kickin'."

  I knelt and prayed:  "O Father, smile
      On him, and mercy show him!"
  That countryman looked on the while,
      And said:  "Ye didn't know him."

      GRAVITATION, n. The tendency of all bodies to approach one another with a
      strength proportion to the quantity of matter they contain&mdash; the
      quantity of matter they contain being ascertained by the strength of their
      tendency to approach one another. This is a lovely and edifying

      GUILLOTINE, n. A machine which makes a Frenchman shrug his shoulders with
      good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his great work on <i>Divergent Lines of Racial Evolution</i>, the
      learned Professor Brayfugle argues from the prevalence of this gesture
      &mdash;the shrug&mdash;among Frenchmen, that they are descended from
      turtles and it is simply a survival of the habit of retracting the head
      inside the shell. It is with reluctance that I differ with so eminent an
      authority, but in my judgment (as more elaborately set forth and enforced
      in my work entitled <i>Hereditary Emotions</i>&mdash;lib. II, c. XI) the
      shrug is a poor foundation upon which to build so important a theory, for
      previously to the Revolution the gesture was unknown. I have not a doubt
      that it is directly referable to the terror inspired by the guillotine
      during the period of that instrument's activity.

      GUNPOWDER, n. An agency employed by civilized nations for the settlement
      of disputes which might become troublesome if left unadjusted. By most
      writers the invention of gunpowder is ascribed to the Chinese, but not
      upon very convincing evidence. Milton says it was invented by the devil to
      dispel angels with, and this opinion seems to derive some support from the
      scarcity of angels. Moreover, it has the hearty concurrence of the Hon.
      James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secretary Wilson became interested in gunpowder through an event that
      occurred on the Government experimental farm in the District of Columbia.
      One day, several years ago, a rogue imperfectly reverent of the
      Secretary's profound attainments and personal character presented him with
      a sack of gunpowder, representing it as the seed of the <i>Flashawful
      flabbergastor</i>, a Patagonian cereal of great commercial value,
      admirably adapted to this climate. The good Secretary was instructed to
      spill it along in a furrow and afterward inhume it with soil. This he at
      once proceeded to do, and had made a continuous line of it all the way
      across a ten-acre field, when he was made to look backward by a shout from
      the generous donor, who at once dropped a lighted match into the furrow at
      the starting-point. Contact with the earth had somewhat dampened the
      powder, but the startled functionary saw himself pursued by a tall moving
      pillar of fire and smoke and fierce evolution. He stood for a moment
      paralyzed and speechless, then he recollected an engagement and, dropping
      all, absented himself thence with such surprising celerity that to the
      eyes of spectators along the route selected he appeared like a long, dim
      streak prolonging itself with inconceivable rapidity through seven
      villages, and audibly refusing to be comforted. "Great Scott! what is
      that?" cried a surveyor's chainman, shading his eyes and gazing at the
      fading line of agriculturist which bisected his visible horizon. "That,"
      said the surveyor, carelessly glancing at the phenomenon and again
      centering his attention upon his instrument, "is the Meridian of
      Washington."

    <p>
      Among the ancients the idea of Hades was not synonymous with our Hell,
      many of the most respectable men of antiquity residing there in a very
      comfortable kind of way. Indeed, the Elysian Fields themselves were a part
      of Hades, though they have since been removed to Paris. When the Jacobean
      version of the New Testament was in process of evolution the pious and
      learned men engaged in the work insisted by a majority vote on translating
      the Greek word "Aides" as "Hell"; but a conscientious minority member
      secretly possessed himself of the record and struck out the objectional
      word wherever he could find it. At the next meeting, the Bishop of
      Salisbury, looking over the work, suddenly sprang to his feet and said
      with considerable excitement: "Gentlemen, somebody has been razing 'Hell'
      here!" Years afterward the good prelate's death was made sweet by the
      reflection that he had been the means (under Providence) of making an

      HAG, n. An elderly lady whom you do not happen to like; sometimes called,

      the belief that their heads were surrounded by a kind of baleful
      lumination or nimbus&mdash;hag being the popular name of that peculiar
      electrical light sometimes observed in the hair. At one time hag was not a
      word of reproach: Drayton speaks of a "beautiful hag, all smiles," much as
      Shakespeare said, "sweet wench." It would not now be proper to call your
      sweetheart a hag&mdash;that compliment is reserved for the use of her

      HALF, n. One of two equal parts into which a thing may be divided, or
      considered as divided. In the fourteenth century a heated discussion arose
      among theologists and philosophers as to whether Omniscience could part an
      object into three halves; and the pious Father Aldrovinus publicly prayed
      in the cathedral at Rouen that God would demonstrate the affirmative of
      the proposition in some signal and unmistakable way, and particularly (if
      it should please Him) upon the body of that hardy blasphemer, Manutius
      Procinus, who maintained the negative. Procinus, however, was spared to
      die of the bite of a viper.

      HALO, n. Properly, a luminous ring encircling an astronomical body, but
      not infrequently confounded with "aureola," or "nimbus," a somewhat
      similar phenomenon worn as a head-dress by divinities and saints. The halo
      is a purely optical illusion, produced by moisture in the air, in the
      manner of a rainbow; but the aureola is conferred as a sign of superior
      sanctity, in the same way as a bishop's mitre, or the Pope's tiara. In the
      painting of the Nativity, by Szedgkin, a pious artist of Pesth, not only
      do the Virgin and the Child wear the nimbus, but an ass nibbling hay from
      the sacred manger is similarly decorated and, to his lasting honor be it
      said, appears to bear his unaccustomed dignity with a truly saintly grace.

      knew nothing of it and intrusted its duties to the sleeve. Shakespeare's
      introducing it into the play of "Othello" is an anachronism: Desdemona
      dried her nose with her skirt, as Dr. Mary Walker and other reformers have
      done with their coattails in our own day&mdash;an evidence that

      are now performed by an electrician, as in New Jersey, where executions by

    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In ancient times there lived a king
  Whose tax-collectors could not wring
  From all his subjects gold enough
  To make the royal way less rough.
  For pleasure's highway, like the dames
  Whose premises adjoin it, claims
  Perpetual repairing.  So
  The tax-collectors in a row
  Appeared before the throne to pray
  Their master to devise some way
  To swell the revenue.  "So great,"
  Said they, "are the demands of state
  A tithe of all that we collect
  Will scarcely meet them.  Pray reflect:
  How, if one-tenth we must resign,
  Can we exist on t'other nine?"
  The monarch asked them in reply:
  "Has it occurred to you to try
  The advantage of economy?"
  "It has," the spokesman said:  "we sold
  All of our gray garrotes of gold;
  With plated-ware we now compress
  The necks of those whom we assess.
  Plain iron forceps we employ
  To mitigate the miser's joy
  Who hoards, with greed that never tires,
  That which your Majesty requires."
  Deep lines of thought were seen to plow
  Their way across the royal brow.
  "Your state is desperate, no question;
  Pray favor me with a suggestion."
  "O King of Men," the spokesman said,
  "If you'll impose upon each head
  A tax, the augmented revenue
  We'll cheerfully divide with you."
  As flashes of the sun illume
  The parted storm-cloud's sullen gloom,
  The king smiled grimly.  "I decree
  That it be so&mdash;and, not to be
  In generosity outdone,
  Declare you, each and every one,
  Exempted from the operation
  Of this new law of capitation.
  But lest the people censure me
  Because they're bound and you are free,
  'Twere well some clever scheme were laid
  By you this poll-tax to evade.
  I'll leave you now while you confer
  With my most trusted minister."
  The monarch from the throne-room walked
  And straightway in among them stalked
  A silent man, with brow concealed,
  Bare-armed&mdash;his gleaming axe revealed!

      belief. It is now known that the sentiments and emotions reside in the
      stomach, being evolved from food by chemical action of the gastric fluid.
      The exact process by which a beefsteak becomes a feeling&mdash;tender or
      not, according to the age of the animal from which it was cut; the
      successive stages of elaboration through which a caviar sandwich is
      transmuted to a quaint fancy and reappears as a pungent epigram; the
      marvelous functional methods of converting a hard-boiled egg into
      religious contrition, or a cream-puff into a sigh of sensibility&mdash;these
      things have been patiently ascertained by M. Pasteur, and by him expounded
      with convincing lucidity. (See, also, my monograph, <i>The Essential
      Identity of the Spiritual Affections and Certain Intestinal Gases Freed in
      Digestion</i>&mdash;4to, 687 pp.) In a scientific work entitled, I
      believe, <i>Delectatio Demonorum</i> (John Camden Hotton, London, 1873)

  Though Hebrew and Howison cannot agree
      On a <i>modus vivendi</i>&mdash;not they!&mdash;
  Yet Heaven has had the designing of me,
      And I haven't been reared in a way
      To joy in the thick of the fray.

  For this of my creed is the soul and the gist,

  Who differs from me in his faith is an 'ist,

      HIBERNATE, v.i. To pass the winter season in domestic seclusion. There
      have been many singular popular notions about the hibernation of various
      animals. Many believe that the bear hibernates during the whole winter and
      subsists by mechanically sucking its paws. It is admitted that it comes
      out of its retirement in the spring so lean that it had to try twice
      before it can cast a shadow. Three or four centuries ago, in England, no
      fact was better attested than that swallows passed the winter months in
      the mud at the bottom of their brooks, clinging together in globular
      masses. They have apparently been compelled to give up the custom on
      account of the foulness of the brooks. Sotus Ecobius discovered in Central
      Asia a whole nation of people who hibernate. By some investigators, the
      fasting of Lent is supposed to have been originally a modified form of
      hibernation, to which the Church gave a religious significance; but this
      view was strenuously opposed by that eminent authority, Bishop Kip, who

      I is the first letter of the alphabet, the first word of the language, the
      first thought of the mind, the first object of affection. In grammar it is
      a pronoun of the first person and singular number. Its plural is said to
      be <i>We</i>, but how there can be more than one myself is doubtless
      clearer to the grammarians than it is to the author of this incomparable
      dictionary. Conception of two myselfs is difficult, but fine. The frank
      yet graceful use of "I" distinguishes a good writer from a bad; the latter
      carries it with the manner of a thief trying to cloak his loot.

      For the poor things would have other idols in place of those he thwacketh

  There was once a man in Ispahan
      Ever and ever so long ago,
  And he had a head, the phrenologists said,
      That fitted him for a show.

  For his modesty's bump was so large a lump
      (Nature, they said, had taken a freak)
  That its summit stood far above the wood
      Of his hair, like a mountain peak.

  So modest a man in all Ispahan,
      Over and over again they swore&mdash;
  So humble and meek, you would vainly seek;
      None ever was found before.

  Meantime the hump of that awful bump
      Into the heavens contrived to get
  To so great a height that they called the wight
      The man with the minaret.

  There wasn't a man in all Ispahan
      Prouder, or louder in praise of his chump:
  With a tireless tongue and a brazen lung
      He bragged of that beautiful bump

  Till the Shah in a rage sent a trusty page
      Bearing a sack and a bow-string too,
  And that gentle child explained as he smiled:

      IMPALE, v.t. In popular usage to pierce with any weapon which remains
      fixed in the wound. This, however, is inaccurate; to impale is, properly,
      to put to death by thrusting an upright sharp stake into the body, the
      victim being left in a sitting position. This was a common mode of
      punishment among many of the nations of antiquity, and is still in high
      favor in China and other parts of Asia. Down to the beginning of the
      fifteenth century it was widely employed in "churching" heretics and
      schismatics. Wolecraft calls it the "stoole of repentynge," and among the
      common people it was jocularly known as "riding the one legged horse."
      Ludwig Salzmann informs us that in Thibet impalement is considered the
      most appropriate punishment for crimes against religion; and although in
      China it is sometimes awarded for secular offences, it is most frequently
      adjudged in cases of sacrilege. To the person in actual experience of
      impalement it must be a matter of minor importance by what kind of civil
      or religious dissent he was made acquainted with its discomforts; but
      doubtless he would feel a certain satisfaction if able to contemplate
      himself in the character of a weather-cock on the spire of the True
      Church.

      INADMISSIBLE, adj. Not competent to be considered. Said of certain kinds
      of testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with,
      and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before
      themselves alone. Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person
      quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most
      momentous actions, military, political, commercial and of every other
      kind, are daily undertaken on hearsay evidence. There is no religion in
      the world that has any other basis than hearsay evidence. Revelation is
      hearsay evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the
      testimony of men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and
      who are not known to have been sworn in any sense. Under the rules of
      evidence as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the
      Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law. It
      cannot be proved that the battle of Blenheim ever was fought, that there
      was such as person as Julius Caesar, such an empire as Assyria.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as records of courts of justice are admissible, it can easily be
      proved that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a
      scourge to mankind. The evidence (including confession) upon which certain
      women were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is
      still unimpeachable. The judges' decisions based on it were sound in logic
      and in law. Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved
      than the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered
      death. If there were no witches, human testimony and human reason are
      alike destitute of value.

      INAUSPICIOUSLY, adv. In an unpromising manner, the auspices being
      unfavorable. Among the Romans it was customary before undertaking any
      important action or enterprise to obtain from the augurs, or state
      prophets, some hint of its probable outcome; and one of their favorite and
      most trustworthy modes of divination consisted in observing the flight of
      birds&mdash;the omens thence derived being called <i>auspices</i>.
      Newspaper reporters and certain miscreant lexicographers have decided that
      the word&mdash;always in the plural&mdash;shall mean "patronage" or
      "management"; as, "The festivities were under the auspices of the Ancient
      and Honorable Order of Body-Snatchers"; or, "The hilarities were
      auspicated by the Knights of Hunger."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A Roman slave appeared one day
  Before the Augur.  "Tell me, pray,
  If&mdash;" here the Augur, smiling, made
  A checking gesture and displayed
  His open palm, which plainly itched,
  For visibly its surface twitched.
  A <i>denarius</i> (the Latin nickel)
  Successfully allayed the tickle,
  And then the slave proceeded:  "Please
  Inform me whether Fate decrees
  Success or failure in what I
  To-night (if it be dark) shall try.
  Its nature?  Never mind&mdash;I think
  'Tis writ on this"&mdash;and with a wink
  Which darkened half the earth, he drew
  Another denarius to view,
  Its shining face attentive scanned,
  Then slipped it into the good man's hand,
  Who with great gravity said:  "Wait
  While I retire to question Fate."
  That holy person then withdrew
  His scared clay and, passing through
  The temple's rearward gate, cried "Shoo!"
  Waving his robe of office.  Straight
  Each sacred peacock and its mate
  (Maintained for Juno's favor) fled
  With clamor from the trees o'erhead,
  Where they were perching for the night.
  The temple's roof received their flight,
  For thither they would always go,
  When danger threatened them below.
  Back to the slave the Augur went:
  "My son, forecasting the event
  By flight of birds, I must confess
  The auspices deny success."
  That slave retired, a sadder man,
  Abandoning his secret plan&mdash;
  Which was (as well the crafty seer
  Had from the first divined) to clear
  The wall and fraudulently seize
  On Juno's poultry in the trees.

      INCOME, n. The natural and rational gauge and measure of respectability,
      the commonly accepted standards being artificial, arbitrary and
      fallacious; for, as "Sir Sycophas Chrysolater" in the play has justly
      remarked, "the true use and function of property (in whatsoever it
      consisteth&mdash;coins, or land, or houses, or merchant-stuff, or anything
      which may be named as holden of right to one's own subservience) as also
      of honors, titles, preferments and place, and all favor and acquaintance
      of persons of quality or ableness, are but to get money. Hence it
      followeth that all things are truly to be rated as of worth in measure of
      their serviceableness to that end; and their possessors should take rank
      in agreement thereto, neither the lord of an unproducing manor, howsoever
      broad and ancient, nor he who bears an unremunerate dignity, nor yet the
      pauper favorite of a king, being esteemed of level excellency with him
      whose riches are of daily accretion; and hardly should they whose wealth

      them, but not enough for both&mdash;as Walt Whitman's poetry and God's
      mercy to man. Incompossibility, it will be seen, is only incompatibility
      let loose. Instead of such low language as "Go heel yourself&mdash;I mean
      to kill you on sight," the words, "Sir, we are incompossible," would
      convey an equally significant intimation and in stately courtesy are

      of the good dames who wish to be loyal to their marriage vows, generally
      speaking. A certain lady applied to the parish priest to learn how they
      might, in the dark, distinguish the hardy intruder from their husbands.

      INFERIAE, n. [Latin] Among the Greeks and Romans, sacrifices for
      propitiation of the <i>Dii Manes</i>, or souls of the dead heroes; for the
      pious ancients could not invent enough gods to satisfy their spiritual
      needs, and had to have a number of makeshift deities, or, as a sailor
      might say, jury-gods, which they made out of the most unpromising
      materials. It was while sacrificing a bullock to the spirit of Agamemnon
      that Laiaides, a priest of Aulis, was favored with an audience of that
      illustrious warrior's shade, who prophetically recounted to him the birth
      of Christ and the triumph of Christianity, giving him also a rapid but
      tolerably complete review of events down to the reign of Saint Louis. The
      narrative ended abruptly at that point, owing to the inconsiderate crowing
      of a cock, which compelled the ghosted King of Men to scamper back to
      Hades. There is a fine mediaeval flavor to this story, and as it has not
      been traced back further than Pere Brateille, a pious but obscure writer
      at the court of Saint Louis, we shall probably not err on the side of
      presumption in considering it apocryphal, though Monsignor Capel's
      judgment of the matter might be different; and to that I bow&mdash;wow.

      INFRALAPSARIAN, n. One who ventures to believe that Adam need not have
      sinned unless he had a mind to&mdash;in opposition to the Supralapsarians,
      who hold that that luckless person's fall was decreed from the beginning.
      Infralapsarians are sometimes called Sublapsarians without material effect
      upon the importance and lucidity of their views about Adam.

  Two theologues once, as they wended their way
  To chapel, engaged in colloquial fray&mdash;
  An earnest logomachy, bitter as gall,
  Concerning poor Adam and what made him fall.
  "'Twas Predestination," cried one&mdash;"for the Lord
  Decreed he should fall of his own accord."
  "Not so&mdash;'twas Free will," the other maintained,
  "Which led him to choose what the Lord had ordained."
  So fierce and so fiery grew the debate
  That nothing but bloodshed their dudgeon could sate;
  So off flew their cassocks and caps to the ground
  And, moved by the spirit, their hands went round.
  Ere either had proved his theology right
  By winning, or even beginning, the fight,
  A gray old professor of Latin came by,
  A staff in his hand and a scowl in his eye,
  And learning the cause of their quarrel (for still
  As they clumsily sparred they disputed with skill
  Of foreordinational freedom of will)
  Cried:  "Sirrahs! this reasonless warfare compose:
  Atwixt ye's no difference worthy of blows.
  The sects ye belong to&mdash;I'm ready to swear
  Ye wrongly interpret the names that they bear.
  <i>You</i>&mdash;Infralapsarian son of a clown!&mdash;
  Should only contend that Adam slipped down;
  While <i>you</i>&mdash;you Supralapsarian pup!&mdash;
  Should nothing aver but that Adam slipped up.
  It's all the same whether up or down
  You slip on a peel of banana brown.
  Even Adam analyzed not his blunder,
  But thought he had slipped on a peal of thunder!

      it may be used to make reputations and unmake them; to blacken them and to
      make them white; but it is most generally and acceptably employed as a

      whitewash to conceal afterward the rascal quality of the material. There
      are men called journalists who have established ink baths which some

      philosophy, being itself an innate idea and therefore inaccessible to

      ability to conduct a newspaper, in the greatness of one's country, in the

      IN'ARDS, n. The stomach, heart, soul and other bowels. Many eminent

      organ known as the spleen is nothing less than our immortal part. To the
      contrary, Professor Garrett P. Servis holds that man's soul is that
      prolongation of his spinal marrow which forms the pith of his no tail; and
      for demonstration of his faith points confidently to the fact that
      tailed animals have no souls. Concerning these two theories, it is best to

  INSURANCE AGENT:  My dear sir, that is a fine house&mdash;pray let me
      insure it.
  HOUSE OWNER:  With pleasure.  Please make the annual premium so
      low that by the time when, according to the tables of your
      actuary, it will probably be destroyed by fire I will have
      paid you considerably less than the face of the policy.
  INSURANCE AGENT:  O dear, no&mdash;we could not afford to do that.
      We must fix the premium so that you will have paid more.
  HOUSE OWNER:  How, then, can <i>I</i> afford <i>that</i>?
  INSURANCE AGENT:  Why, your house may burn down at any time.
      There was Smith's house, for example, which&mdash;
  HOUSE OWNER:  Spare me&mdash;there were Brown's house, on the
      contrary, and Jones's house, and Robinson's house, which&mdash;
  INSURANCE AGENT:  Spare <i>me</i>!
  HOUSE OWNER:  Let us understand each other.  You want me to pay
      you money on the supposition that something will occur
      previously to the time set by yourself for its occurrence.  In
      other words, you expect me to bet that my house will not last
      so long as you say that it will probably last.
  INSURANCE AGENT:  But if your house burns without insurance it
      will be a total loss.
  HOUSE OWNER:  Beg your pardon&mdash;by your own actuary's tables I
      shall probably have saved, when it burns, all the premiums I
      would otherwise have paid to you&mdash;amounting to more than the
      face of the policy they would have bought.  But suppose it to
      burn, uninsured, before the time upon which your figures are
      based.  If I could not afford that, how could you if it were
      insured?
  INSURANCE AGENT:  O, we should make ourselves whole from our
      luckier ventures with other clients.  Virtually, they pay your
      loss.
  HOUSE OWNER:  And virtually, then, don't I help to pay their
      losses?  Are not their houses as likely as mine to burn before
      they have paid you as much as you must pay them?  The case
      stands this way:  you expect to take more money from your
      clients than you pay to them, do you not?
  INSURANCE AGENT:  Certainly; if we did not&mdash;
  HOUSE OWNER:  I would not trust you with my money.  Very well
      then.  If it is <i>certain</i>, with reference to the whole body of
      your clients, that they lose money on you it is <i>probable</i>,
      with reference to any one of them, that <i>he</i> will.  It is
      these individual probabilities that make the aggregate
      certainty.
  INSURANCE AGENT:  I will not deny it&mdash;but look at the figures in
      this pamph&mdash;
  HOUSE OWNER:  Heaven forbid!
  INSURANCE AGENT:  You spoke of saving the premiums which you would
      otherwise pay to me.  Will you not be more likely to squander
      them?  We offer you an incentive to thrift.
  HOUSE OWNER:  The willingness of A to take care of B's money is
      not peculiar to insurance, but as a charitable institution you
      command esteem.  Deign to accept its expression from a
      Deserving Object.

      J
    </h1>
    <p>
      J is a consonant in English, but some nations use it as a vowel&mdash;
      than which nothing could be more absurd. Its original form, which has been
      but slightly modified, was that of the tail of a subdued dog, and it was
      not a letter but a character, standing for a Latin verb, <i>jacere</i>,
      "to throw," because when a stone is thrown at a dog the dog's tail assumes
      that shape. This is the origin of the letter, as expounded by the renowned
      Dr. Jocolpus Bumer, of the University of Belgrade, who established his
      conclusions on the subject in a work of three quarto volumes and committed
      suicide on being reminded that the j in the Roman alphabet had originally

      JESTER, n. An officer formerly attached to a king's household, whose
      business it was to amuse the court by ludicrous actions and utterances,
      the absurdity being attested by his motley costume. The king himself being
      attired with dignity, it took the world some centuries to discover that
      his own conduct and decrees were sufficiently ridiculous for the amusement
      not only of his court but of all mankind. The jester was commonly called a
      fool, but the poets and romancers have ever delighted to represent him as
      a singularly wise and witty person. In the circus of to-day the melancholy
      ghost of the court fool effects the dejection of humbler audiences with
      the same jests wherewith in life he gloomed the marble hall, panged the
      patrician sense of humor and tapped the tank of royal tears.

      My sins are more than scarlet:
  I love my fool&mdash;blaspheming clown,
      And common, base-born varlet."

  "Daughter," the mimic priest replied,
      "That sin, indeed, is awful:
  The church's pardon is denied
      To love that is unlawful.
  "But since thy stubborn heart will be
      For him forever pleading,
  Thou'dst better make him, by decree,
      A man of birth and breeding."

  She made the fool a duke, in hope
      With Heaven's taboo to palter;

      K
    </h1>
    <p>
      K is a consonant that we get from the Greeks, but it can be traced away
      back beyond them to the Cerathians, a small commercial nation inhabiting
      the peninsula of Smero. In their tongue it was called <i>Klatch</i>, which
      means "destroyed." The form of the letter was originally precisely that of
      our H, but the erudite Dr. Snedeker explains that it was altered to its
      present shape to commemorate the destruction of the great temple of Jarute
      by an earthquake, <i>circa</i> 730 B.C. This building was famous for the
      two lofty columns of its portico, one of which was broken in half by the
      catastrophe, the other remaining intact. As the earlier form of the letter
      is supposed to have been suggested by these pillars, so, it is thought by
      the great antiquary, its later was adopted as a simple and natural&mdash;not
      to say touching&mdash;means of keeping the calamity ever in the national
      memory. It is not known if the name of the letter was altered as an
      additional mnemonic, or if the name was always <i>Klatch</i> and the
      destruction one of nature's puns. As each theory seems probable enough, I
      see no objection to believing both&mdash;and Dr. Snedeker arrayed himself
      on that side of the question.

  God speed the day when this knighting fad
  Shall go to the dogs and the dogs go mad.

      KORAN, n. A book which the Mohammedans foolishly believe to have been

      LAND, n. A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory
      that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the
      foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the
      superstructure. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have
      the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the
      right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted
      wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area
      of <i>terra firma</i> is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for
      D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.

      LAOCOON, n. A famous piece of antique scripture representing a priest of
      that name and his two sons in the folds of two enormous serpents. The
      skill and diligence with which the old man and lads support the serpents
      and keep them up to their work have been justly regarded as one of the
      noblest artistic illustrations of the mastery of human intelligence over

      adult males. The male of our species has a rudimentary lap, imperfectly

      LAUGHTER, n. An interior convulsion, producing a distortion of the
      features and accompanied by inarticulate noises. It is infectious and,
      though intermittent, incurable. Liability to attacks of laughter is one of
      the characteristics distinguishing man from the animals&mdash; these being
      not only inaccessible to the provocation of his example, but impregnable
      to the microbes having original jurisdiction in bestowal of the disease.
      Whether laughter could be imparted to animals by inoculation from the
      human patient is a question that has not been answered by experimentation.
      Dr. Meir Witchell holds that the infectious character of laughter is due to
      the instantaneous fermentation of <i>sputa</i> diffused in a spray. From
      this peculiarity he names the disorder <i>Convulsio spargens</i>.

      LAUREATE, adj. Crowned with leaves of the laurel. In England the Poet
      Laureate is an officer of the sovereign's court, acting as dancing
      skeleton at every royal feast and singing-mute at every royal funeral. Of
      all incumbents of that high office, Robert Southey had the most notable
      knack at drugging the Samson of public joy and cutting his hair to the
      quick; and he had an artistic color-sense which enabled him so to blacken
      a public grief as to give it the aspect of a national crime.

      LEAD, n. A heavy blue-gray metal much used in giving stability to light
      lovers&mdash;particularly to those who love not wisely but other men's
      wives. Lead is also of great service as a counterpoise to an argument of
      such weight that it turns the scale of debate the wrong way. An
      interesting fact in the chemistry of international controversy is that at
      the point of contact of two patriotisms lead is precipitated in great

      It should be explained that Mrs. Silcox does not undertake to teach
      pronunciation of the Greek and Latin tongues. Leonine verses are so called
      in honor of a poet named Leo, whom prosodists appear to find a pleasure in
      believing to have been the first to discover that a rhyming couplet could
      be run into a single line.

      LETTUCE, n. An herb of the genus <i>Lactuca</i>, "Wherewith," says that
      pious gastronome, Hengist Pelly, "God has been pleased to reward the good
      and punish the wicked. For by his inner light the righteous man has
      discerned a manner of compounding for it a dressing to the appetency
      whereof a multitude of gustible condiments conspire, being reconciled and
      ameliorated with profusion of oil, the entire comestible making glad the
      heart of the godly and causing his face to shine. But the person of
      spiritual unworth is successfully tempted to the Adversary to eat of
      lettuce with destitution of oil, mustard, egg, salt and garlic, and with a
      rascal bath of vinegar polluted with sugar. Wherefore the person of
      spiritual unworth suffers an intestinal pang of strange complexity and

      species of gigantic Tadpole (<i>Thaddeus Polandensis</i>) or Polliwig&mdash;<i>Maria

      LEXICOGRAPHER, n. A pestilent fellow who, under the pretense of recording
      some particular stage in the development of a language, does what he can
      to arrest its growth, stiffen its flexibility and mechanize its methods.
      For your lexicographer, having written his dictionary, comes to be
      considered "as one having authority," whereas his function is only to make
      a record, not to give a law. The natural servility of the human
      understanding having invested him with judicial power, surrenders its
      right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statute.
      Let the dictionary (for example) mark a good word as "obsolete" or
      "obsolescent" and few men thereafter venture to use it, whatever their
      need of it and however desirable its restoration to favor&mdash;whereby
      the process of impoverishment is accelerated and speech decays. On the
      contrary, the bold and discerning writer who, recognizing the truth that language must grow by innovation if
      it grow at all, makes new words and uses the old in an unfamiliar sense,
      has no following and is tartly reminded that "it isn't in the dictionary"
      &mdash;although down to the time of the first lexicographer (Heaven
      forgive him!) no author ever had used a word that <i>was</i> in the
      dictionary. In the golden prime and high noon of English speech; when from
      the lips of the great Elizabethans fell words that made their own meaning
      and carried it in their very sound; when a Shakespeare and a Bacon were
      possible, and the language now rapidly perishing at one end and slowly
      renewed at the other was in vigorous growth and hardy preservation&mdash;sweeter
      than honey and stronger than a lion&mdash;the lexicographer was a person
      unknown, the dictionary a creation which his Creator had not created him
      to create.

  God said:  "Let Spirit perish into Form,"
  And lexicographers arose, a swarm!
  Thought fled and left her clothing, which they took,
  And catalogued each garment in a book.

  "Give me my clothes and I'll return," they rise
  And scan the list, and say without compassion:
  "Excuse us&mdash;they are mostly out of fashion."

      LICKSPITTLE, n. A useful functionary, not infrequently found editing a

      blackmailer by the tie of occasional identity; for in truth the
      lickspittle is only the blackmailer under another aspect, although the
      latter is frequently found as an independent species. Lickspittling is
      more detestable than blackmailing, precisely as the business of a

      those who think it is not, many of whom have written at great length in

  'Twas a pair of boots that the lady bought,

      To a very remarkable height&mdash;
  Higher, indeed, than I think he ought&mdash;
      Higher than <i>can</i> be right.
  For the Bible declares&mdash;but never mind:
      It is hardly fit
  To censure freely and fault to find
  With others for sins that I'm not inclined
      Myself to commit.
  Each has his weakness, and though my own
      Is freedom from every sin,
      It still were unfair to pitch in,
  Discharging the first censorious stone.
  Besides, the truth compels me to say,
  The boots in question were <i>made</i> that way.
  As he drew the lace she made a grimace,
      And blushingly said to him:
  "This boot, I'm sure, is too high to endure,
  It hurts my&mdash;hurts my&mdash;limb."
  The salesman smiled in a manner mild,
  Like an artless, undesigning child;
  Then, checking himself, to his face he gave
  A look as sorrowful as the grave,

  For her pains and throes,
  As he stroked her toes,
  Remarking with speech and manner just
  Befitting his calling:  "Madam, I trust

    <p>
      The King of Manchuria had a magic looking-glass, whereon whoso looked saw,
      not his own image, but only that of the king. A certain courtier who had
      long enjoyed the king's favor and was thereby enriched beyond any other
      subject of the realm, said to the king: "Give me, I pray, thy wonderful
      mirror, so that when absent out of thine august presence I may yet do
      homage before thy visible shadow, prostrating myself night and morning in
      the glory of thy benign countenance, as which nothing has so divine
      splendor, O Noonday Sun of the Universe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Please with the speech, the king commanded that the mirror be conveyed to
      the courtier's palace; but after, having gone thither without apprisal, he
      found it in an apartment where was naught but idle lumber. And the mirror
      was dimmed with dust and overlaced with cobwebs. This so angered him that
      he fisted it hard, shattering the glass, and was sorely hurt. Enraged all
      the more by this mischance, he commanded that the ungrateful courtier be
      thrown into prison, and that the glass be repaired and taken back to his
      own palace; and this was done. But when the king looked again on the
      mirror he saw not his image as before, but only the figure of a crowned
      ass, having a bloody bandage on one of its hinder hooves&mdash;as the
      artificers and all who had looked upon it had before discerned but feared
      to report. Taught wisdom and charity, the king restored his courtier to
      liberty, had the mirror set into the back of the throne and reigned many
      years with justice and humility; and one day when he fell asleep in death
      while on the throne, the whole court saw in the mirror the luminous figure
      of an angel, which remains to this day.

  Miss Sallie Ann Splurge, of her own accord,
  Wedded a wandering English lord&mdash;
  Wedded and took him to dwell with her "paw,"
  A parent who throve by the practice of Draw.
  Lord Cadde I don't hesitate to declare
  Unworthy the father-in-legal care
  Of that elderly sport, notwithstanding the truth
  That Cadde had renounced all the follies of youth;
  For, sad to relate, he'd arrived at the stage
  Of existence that's marked by the vices of age.
  Among them, cupidity caused him to urge
  Repeated demands on the pocket of Splurge,
  Till, wrecked in his fortune, that gentleman saw
  Inadequate aid in the practice of Draw,
  And took, as a means of augmenting his pelf,
  To the business of being a lord himself.
  His neat-fitting garments he wilfully shed
  And sacked himself strangely in checks instead;
  Denuded his chin, but retained at each ear
  A whisker that looked like a blasted career.
  He painted his neck an incarnadine hue
  Each morning and varnished it all that he knew.
  The moony monocular set in his eye
  Appeared to be scanning the Sweet Bye-and-Bye.
  His head was enroofed with a billycock hat,
  And his low-necked shoes were aduncous and flat.
  In speech he eschewed his American ways,
  Denying his nose to the use of his A's
  And dulling their edge till the delicate sense
  Of a babe at their temper could take no offence.
  His H's&mdash;'twas most inexpressibly sweet,
  The patter they made as they fell at his feet!
  Re-outfitted thus, Mr. Splurge without fear
  Began as Lord Splurge his recouping career.

  His lordship in horror, despair and dismay
  From the land of the nobleman's natural prey.
  For, smit with his Old World ways, Lady Cadde

      LORE, n. Learning&mdash;particularly that sort which is not derived from a
      regular course of instruction but comes of the reading of occult books, or
      by nature. This latter is commonly designated as folk-lore and embraces
      popularly myths and superstitions. In Baring-Gould's <i>Curious Myths of
      the Middle Ages</i> the reader will find many of these traced backward,
      through various people on converging lines, toward a common origin in
      remote antiquity. Among these are the fables of "Teddy the Giant Killer,"
      "The Sleeping John Sharp Williams," "Little Red Riding Hood and the Sugar
      Trust," "Beauty and the Brisbane," "The Seven Aldermen of Ephesus," "Rip
      Van Fairbanks," and so forth. The fable which Goethe so affectingly relates
      under the title of "The Erl-King" was known two thousand years ago in
      Greece as "The Demos and the Infant Industry." One of the most general and
      ancient of these myths is that Arabian tale of "Ali Baba and the Forty

      LOSS, n. Privation of that which we had, or had not. Thus, in the latter

      LOVE, n. A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of the
      patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder. This
      disease, like <i>caries</i> and many other ailments, is prevalent only
      among civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous
      nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from its
      ravages. It is sometimes fatal, but more frequently to the physician than
      to the patient.

      LUNARIAN, n. An inhabitant of the moon, as distinguished from Lunatic, one
      whom the moon inhabits. The Lunarians have been described by Lucian, Locke
      and other observers, but without much agreement. For example, Bragellos
      avers their anatomical identity with Man, but Professor Newcomb says they
      are more like the hill tribes of Vermont.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I sit astride Parnassus with my lyre,
  And pick with care the disobedient wire.
  That stupid shepherd lolling on his crook

  When, with a Titan's energy and strength,
  I'll grab a fistful of the strings, and O,

      MACROBIAN, n. One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age. History
      is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old Parr, but
      some notable instances of longevity are less well known. A Calabrian
      peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he had what he
      considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace. Scanavius relates
      that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he could remember a time
      when he did not deserve hanging. In 1566 a linen draper of Bristol,
      England, declared that he had lived five hundred years, and that in all
      that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity (<i>macrobiosis</i>)
      in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better.
      The editor of <i>The American</i>, a newspaper in New York City, has a
      memory that goes back to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the
      fact. The President of the United States was born so long ago that many of
      the friends of his youth have risen to high political and military
      preferment without the assistance of personal merit. The verses following
      were written by a macrobian:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When I was young the world was fair
      And amiable and sunny.
  A brightness was in all the air,
      In all the waters, honey.
      The jokes were fine and funny,
  The statesmen honest in their views,
      And in their lives, as well,
  And when you heard a bit of news
      'Twas true enough to tell.
  Men were not ranting, shouting, reeking,
  Nor women "generally speaking."

  The Summer then was long indeed:
      It lasted one whole season!
  The sparkling Winter gave no heed
      When ordered by Unreason
      To bring the early peas on.
  Now, where the dickens is the sense
      In calling that a year
  Which does no more than just commence
      Before the end is near?
  When I was young the year extended
  From month to month until it ended.
  I know not why the world has changed
      To something dark and dreary,
  And everything is now arranged
      To make a fellow weary.
      The Weather Man&mdash;I fear he
  Has much to do with it, for, sure,
      The air is not the same:
  It chokes you when it is impure,
      When pure it makes you lame.
  With windows closed you are asthmatic;
  Open, neuralgic or sciatic.

  Well, I suppose this new regime
      Of dun degeneration
  Seems eviler than it would seem
      To a better observation,
      And has for compensation
  Some blessings in a deep disguise
      Which mortal sight has failed
  To pierce, although to angels' eyes
      They're visible unveiled.
  If Age is such a boon, good land!
  He's costumed by a master hand!

      MAD, adj. Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence; not
      conforming to standards of thought, speech and action derived by the
      conformants from study of themselves; at odds with the majority; in short,
      unusual. It is noteworthy that persons are pronounced mad by officials
      destitute of evidence that themselves are sane. For illustration, this
      present (and illustrious) lexicographer is no firmer in the faith of his
      own sanity than is any inmate of any madhouse in the land; yet for aught
      he knows to the contrary, instead of the lofty occupation that seems to
      him to be engaging his powers he may really be beating his hands against
      the window bars of an asylum and declaring himself Noah Webster, to the
      innocent delight of many thoughtless spectators.

      MAGDALENE, n. An inhabitant of Magdala. Popularly, a woman found out. This
      definition of the word has the authority of ignorance, Mary of Magdala
      being another person than the penitent woman mentioned by St. Luke. It has
      also the official sanction of the governments of Great Britain and the
      United States. In England the word is pronounced Maudlin, whence maudlin,
      adjective, unpleasantly sentimental. With their Maudlin for Magdalene, and

      greatest of revisers.

      MAGNIFICENT, adj. Having a grandeur or splendor superior to that to which

    <p>
      MAGNITUDE, n. Size. Magnitude being purely relative, nothing is large and
      nothing small. If everything in the universe were increased in bulk one
      thousand diameters nothing would be any larger than it was before, but if
      one thing remain unchanged all the others would be larger than they had
      been. To an understanding familiar with the relativity of magnitude and
      distance the spaces and masses of the astronomer would be no more
      impressive than those of the microscopist. For anything we know to the
      contrary, the visible universe may be a small part of an atom, with its
      component ions, floating in the life-fluid (luminiferous ether) of some
      animal. Possibly the wee creatures peopling the corpuscles of our own
      blood are overcome with the proper emotion when contemplating the
      unthinkable distance from one of these to another.

      MAIDEN, n. A young person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless conduct
      and views that madden to crime. The genus has a wide geographical
      distribution, being found wherever sought and deplored wherever found. The
      maiden is not altogether unpleasing to the eye, nor (without her piano and
      her views) insupportable to the ear, though in respect to comeliness
      distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with regard to the part of her

      matter. Three great scientific theories of the structure of the universe
      are the molecular, the corpuscular and the atomic. A fourth affirms, with
      Haeckel, the condensation of precipitation of matter from ether&mdash;whose
      existence is proved by the condensation of precipitation. The present
      trend of scientific thought is toward the theory of ions. The ion differs
      from the molecule, the corpuscle and the atom in that it is an ion. A
      fifth theory is held by idiots, but it is doubtful if they know any more
      about the matter than the others.

      knows him by the innate power of considering. He has founded upon him a
      theory of the universe, which the creature bears without resentment, for
      the monad is a gentleman. Small as he is, the monad contains all the
      powers and possibilities needful to his evolution into a German
      philosopher of the first class &mdash;altogether a very capable little
      fellow. He is not to be confounded with the microbe, or bacillus; by its

      influence in public affairs and in the disposition of the human head, but

      MOUSE, n. An animal which strews its path with fainting women. As in Rome
      Christians were thrown to the lions, so centuries earlier in Otumwee, the
      most ancient and famous city of the world, female heretics were thrown to
      the mice. Jakak-Zotp, the historian, the only Otumwump whose writings have
      descended to us, says that these martyrs met their death with little
      dignity and much exertion. He even attempts to exculpate the mice (such is
      the malice of bigotry) by declaring that the unfortunate women perished,
      some from exhaustion, some of broken necks from falling over their own
      feet, and some from lack of restoratives. The mice, he avers, enjoyed the
      pleasures of the chase with composure. But if "Roman history is
      nine-tenths lying," we can hardly expect a smaller proportion of that
      rhetorical figure in the annals of a people capable of so incredible
      cruelty to lovely women; for a hard heart has a false tongue.

      MULTITUDE, n. A crowd; the source of political wisdom and virtue. In a
      republic, the object of the statesman's adoration. "In a multitude of
      counsellors there is wisdom," saith the proverb. If many men of equal
      individual wisdom are wiser than any one of them, it must be that they
      acquire the excess of wisdom by the mere act of getting together. Whence
      comes it? Obviously from nowhere&mdash;as well say that a range of
      mountains is higher than the single mountains composing it. A multitude is
      as wise as its wisest member if it obey him; if not, it is no wiser than

      nose is never so happy as when thrust into the affairs of others, from
      which some physiologists have drawn the inference that the nose is devoid
      of the sense of smell.

      is a phenomenon. Nevertheless, the discovery and exposition of noumena

      NOVEL, n. A short story padded. A species of composition bearing the same
      relation to literature that the panorama bears to art. As it is too long
      to be read at a sitting the impressions made by its successive parts are
      successively effaced, as in the panorama. Unity, totality of effect, is
      impossible; for besides the few pages last read all that is carried in
      mind is the mere plot of what has gone before. To the romance the novel is
      what photography is to painting. Its distinguishing principle,
      probability, corresponds to the literal actuality of the photograph and
      puts it distinctly into the category of reporting; whereas the free wing
      of the romancer enables him to mount to such altitudes of imagination as
      he may be fitted to attain; and the first three essentials of the literary
      art are imagination, imagination and imagination. The art of writing
      novels, such as it was, is long dead everywhere except in Russia, where it
      is new. Peace to its ashes&mdash;some of which have a large sale.

      OBSESSED, p.p. Vexed by an evil spirit, like the Gadarene swine and other
      critics. Obsession was once more common than it is now. Arasthus tells of
      a peasant who was occupied by a different devil for every day in the week,
      and on Sundays by two. They were frequently seen, always walking in his
      shadow, when he had one, but were finally driven away by the village
      notary, a holy man; but they took the peasant with them, for he vanished
      utterly. A devil thrown out of a woman by the Archbishop of Rheims ran
      through the trees, pursued by a hundred persons, until the open country
      was reached, where by a leap higher than a church spire he escaped into a
      bird. A chaplain in Cromwell's army exorcised a soldier's obsessing devil
      by throwing the soldier into the water, when the devil came to the
      surface. The soldier, unfortunately, did not.

      OBSOLETE, adj. No longer used by the timid. Said chiefly of words. A word
      which some lexicographer has marked obsolete is ever thereafter an object
      of dread and loathing to the fool writer, but if it is a good word and has
      no exact modern equivalent equally good, it is good enough for the good
      writer. Indeed, a writer's attitude toward "obsolete" words is as true a
      measure of his literary ability as anything except the character of his
      work. A dictionary of obsolete and obsolescent words would not only be
      singularly rich in strong and sweet parts of speech; it would add large
      possessions to the vocabulary of every competent writer who might not
      happen to be a competent reader.

      OCCASIONAL, adj. Afflicting us with greater or less frequency. That,

      an anniversary, a celebration or other event. True, they afflict us a
      little worse than other sorts of verse, but their name has no reference to

      OPPOSITION, n. In politics the party that prevents the Government from

    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Ghargaroo, who had been abroad to study the science of
      government, appointed one hundred of his fattest subjects as members of a
      parliament to make laws for the collection of revenue. Forty of these he
      named the Party of Opposition and had his Prime Minister carefully
      instruct them in their duty of opposing every royal measure. Nevertheless,
      the first one that was submitted passed unanimously. Greatly displeased,
      the King vetoed it, informing the Opposition that if they did that again
      they would pay for their obstinacy with their heads. The entire forty
      promptly disemboweled themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall we do now?" the King asked. "Liberal institutions cannot be
      maintained without a party of Opposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendor of the universe," replied the Prime Minister, "it is true these
      dogs of darkness have no longer their credentials, but all is not lost.
      Leave the matter to this worm of the dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Minister had the bodies of his Majesty's Opposition embalmed and
      stuffed with straw, put back into the seats of power and nailed there.
      Forty votes were recorded against every bill and the nation prospered. But
      one day a bill imposing a tax on warts was defeated&mdash;the members of
      the Government party had not been nailed to their seats! This so enraged
      the King that the Prime Minister was put to death, the parliament was
      dissolved with a battery of artillery, and government of the people, by
      the people, for the people perished from Ghargaroo.

      OPTIMISM, n. The doctrine, or belief, that everything is beautiful,
      including what is ugly, everything good, especially the bad, and
      everything right that is wrong. It is held with greatest tenacity by those
      most accustomed to the mischance of falling into adversity, and is most
      acceptably expounded with the grin that apes a smile. Being a blind faith,
      it is inaccessible to the light of disproof&mdash;an intellectual
      disorder, yielding to no treatment but death. It is hereditary, but

      ORPHAN, n. A living person whom death has deprived of the power of filial
      ingratitude&mdash;a privation appealing with a particular eloquence to all
      that is sympathetic in human nature. When young the orphan is commonly
      sent to an asylum, where by careful cultivation of its rudimentary sense
      of locality it is taught to know its place. It is then instructed in the
      arts of dependence and servitude and eventually turned loose to prey upon

  I climbed to the top of a mountain one day

  'Twas about an old man and the ass he bestrode
      Till the strength of the beast was o'ertested;
  Then the man would carry him miles on the road
      Till Neddy was pretty well rested.

  The moon rising solemnly over the crest
      Of the hills to the east of my station
  Displayed her broad disk to the darkening west
      Like a visible new creation.

  And I thought of a joke (and I laughed till I cried)

  About a church-door for a look at the bride,
      Although 'twas herself that was married.

      OVATION, n. In ancient Rome, a definite, formal pageant in honor of one who
      had been disserviceable to the enemies of the nation. A lesser "triumph."
      In modern English the word is improperly used to signify any loose and
      spontaneous expression of popular homage to the hero of the hour and
      place.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I had an ovation!" the actor man said,
      But I thought it uncommonly queer,
  That people and critics by him had been led
          By the ear.

  The Latin lexicon makes his absurd
      Assertion as plain as a peg;
  In "ovum" we find the true root of the word.
          It means egg.

      want to go fishing.

    <p>
      OWE, v. To have (and to hold) a debt. The word formerly signified not
      indebtedness, but possession; it meant "own," and in the minds of debtors
      there is still a good deal of confusion between assets and liabilities.
    </p>

      OYSTER, n. A slimy, gobby shellfish which civilization gives men the

      PAINTING, n. The art of protecting flat surfaces from the weather and
      exposing them to the critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly, painting and sculpture were combined in the same work: the
      ancients painted their statues. The only present alliance between the two
      arts is that the modern painter chisels his patrons.

      PALACE, n. A fine and costly residence, particularly that of a great
      official. The residence of a high dignitary of the Christian Church is
      called a palace; that of the Founder of his religion was known as a field,
      or wayside. There is progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      PALM, n. A species of tree having several varieties, of which the familiar
      "itching palm" (<i>Palma hominis</i>) is most widely distributed and
      sedulously cultivated. This noble vegetable exudes a kind of invisible
      gum, which may be detected by applying to the bark a piece of gold or
      silver. The metal will adhere with remarkable tenacity. The fruit of the
      itching palm is so bitter and unsatisfying that a considerable percentage
      of it is sometimes given away in what are known as "benefactions."
    </p>
    <p>
      PALMISTRY, n. The 947th method (according to Mimbleshaw's classification)
      of obtaining money by false pretences. It consists in "reading character"
      in the wrinkles made by closing the hand. The pretence is not altogether
      false; character can really be read very accurately in this way, for the
      wrinkles in every hand submitted plainly spell the word "dupe." The
      imposture consists in not reading it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      PANDEMONIUM, n. Literally, the Place of All the Demons. Most of them have
      escaped into politics and finance, and the place is now used as a lecture
      hall by the Audible Reformer. When disturbed by his voice the ancient
      echoes clamor appropriate responses most gratifying to his pride of
      distinction.

      PANTALOONS, n. A nether habiliment of the adult civilized male. The
      garment is tubular and unprovided with hinges at the points of flexion.
      Supposed to have been invented by a humorist. Called "trousers" by the
      enlightened and "pants" by the unworthy.

      PAST, n. That part of Eternity with some small fraction of which we have a
      slight and regrettable acquaintance. A moving line called the Present
      parts it from an imaginary period known as the Future. These two grand
      divisions of Eternity, of which the one is continually effacing the other,
      are entirely unlike. The one is dark with sorrow and disappointment, the
      other bright with prosperity and joy. The Past is the region of sobs, the
      Future is the realm of song. In the one crouches Memory, clad in sackcloth
      and ashes, mumbling penitential prayer; in the sunshine of the other Hope
      flies with a free wing, beckoning to temples of success and bowers of
      ease. Yet the Past is the Future of yesterday, the Future is the Past of
      to-morrow. They are one&mdash;the knowledge and the dream.

      PASTIME, n. A device for promoting dejection. Gentle exercise for

      POTABLE, n. Suitable for drinking. Water is said to be potable; indeed,
      some declare it our natural beverage, although even they find it palatable
      only when suffering from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which
      it is a medicine. Upon nothing has so great and diligent ingenuity been
      brought to bear in all ages and in all countries, except the most
      uncivilized, as upon the invention of substitutes for water. To hold that
      this general aversion to that liquid has no basis in the preservative
      instinct of the race is to be unscientific&mdash;and without science we
      are as the snakes and toads.

      POVERTY, n. A file provided for the teeth of the rats of reform. The

      victims are distinguished by possession of all the virtues and by their

      PRECEDENT, n. In Law, a previous decision, rule or practice which, in the
      absence of a definite statute, has whatever force and authority a Judge
      may choose to give it, thereby greatly simplifying his task of doing as he
      pleases. As there are precedents for everything, he has only to ignore
      those that make against his interest and accentuate those in the line of
      his desire. Invention of the precedent elevates the trial-at-law from the
      low estate of a fortuitous ordeal to the noble attitude of a dirigible

      affirm their occurrence, that being only an implication from other
      doctrines by which this is entailed. The difference is great enough to
      have deluged Christendom with ink, to say nothing of the gore. With the

      in both, one may hope to escape perdition if spared.

  "Impossible!  I should be ashamed of atheism."

      RELIQUARY, n. A receptacle for such sacred objects as pieces of the true
      cross, short-ribs of the saints, the ears of Balaam's ass, the lung of the
      cock that called Peter to repentance and so forth. Reliquaries are
      commonly of metal, and provided with a lock to prevent the contents from
      coming out and performing miracles at unseasonable times. A feather from
      the wing of the Angel of the Annunciation once escaped during a sermon in
      Saint Peter's and so tickled the noses of the congregation that they woke
      and sneezed with great vehemence three times each. It is related in the
      "Gesta Sanctorum" that a sacristan in the Canterbury cathedral surprised
      the head of Saint Dennis in the library. Reprimanded by its stern
      custodian, it explained that it was seeking a body of doctrine. This
      unseemly levity so raged the diocesan that the offender was publicly
      anathematized, thrown into the Stour and replaced by another head of Saint
      Dennis, brought from Rome.

      RENOWN, n. A degree of distinction between notoriety and fame&mdash;a

      the other. Sometimes it is conferred by an unfriendly and inconsiderate
      hand.

      REPUBLIC, n. A nation in which, the thing governing and the thing governed

      obedience. In a republic, the foundation of public order is the ever
      lessening habit of submission inherited from ancestors who, being truly
      governed, submitted because they had to. There are as many kinds of
      republics as there are graduations between the despotism whence they came

      of the people were advanced a full half-inch. Revolutions are usually
      accompanied by a considerable effusion of blood, but are accounted worth
      it&mdash;this appraisement being made by beneficiaries whose blood had not
      the mischance to be shed. The French revolution is of incalculable value

      RIDICULE, n. Words designed to show that the person of whom they are

      utters them. It may be graphic, mimetic or merely rident. Shaftesbury is
      quoted as having pronounced it the test of truth&mdash;a ridiculous

      derived directly from the will of God; and this is still sometimes
      affirmed <i>in partibus infidelium</i> outside the enlightened realms of
      Democracy; as the well known lines of Sir Abednego Bink, following:

      RIGHTEOUSNESS, n. A sturdy virtue that was once found among the
      Pantidoodles inhabiting the lower part of the peninsula of Oque. Some
      feeble attempts were made by returned missionaries to introduce it into
      several European countries, but it appears to have been imperfectly
      expounded. An example of this faulty exposition is found in the only
      extant sermon of the pious Bishop Rowley, a characteristic passage from
      which is here given:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      "Now righteousness consisteth not merely in a holy state of
  mind, nor yet in performance of religious rites and obedience to
  the letter of the law.  It is not enough that one be pious and
  just:  one must see to it that others also are in the same state;
  and to this end compulsion is a proper means.  Forasmuch as my
  injustice may work ill to another, so by his injustice may evil be
  wrought upon still another, the which it is as manifestly my duty
  to estop as to forestall mine own tort.  Wherefore if I would be
  righteous I am bound to restrain my neighbor, by force if needful,
  in all those injurious enterprises from which, through a better
  disposition and by the help of Heaven, I do myself refrain."

      ROMANCE, n. Fiction that owes no allegiance to the God of Things as They
      Are. In the novel the writer's thought is tethered to probability, as a
      domestic horse to the hitching-post, but in romance it ranges at will over
      the entire region of the imagination&mdash;free, lawless, immune to bit
      and rein. Your novelist is a poor creature, as Carlyle might say&mdash;a
      mere reporter. He may invent his characters and plot, but he must not
      imagine anything taking place that might not occur, albeit his entire
      narrative is candidly a lie. Why he imposes this hard condition on
      himself, and "drags at each remove a lengthening chain" of his own forging
      he can explain in ten thick volumes without illuminating by so much as a
      candle's ray the black profound of his own ignorance of the matter. There
      are great novels, for great writers have "laid waste their powers" to
      write them, but it remains true that far and away the most fascinating
      fiction that we have is "The Thousand and One Nights."

      ROPE, n. An obsolescent appliance for reminding assassins that they too

      long. It has been largely superseded by a more complex electrical device
      worn upon another part of the person; and this is rapidly giving place to
      an apparatus known as the preachment.

      ROSTRUM, n. In Latin, the beak of a bird or the prow of a ship. In

    <p>
      ROUNDHEAD, n. A member of the Parliamentarian party in the English civil
      war&mdash;so called from his habit of wearing his hair short, whereas his
      enemy, the Cavalier, wore his long. There were other points of difference
      between them, but the fashion in hair was the fundamental cause of
      quarrel. The Cavaliers were royalists because the king, an indolent
      fellow, found it more convenient to let his hair grow than to wash his
      neck. This the Roundheads, who were mostly barbers and soap-boilers,
      deemed an injury to trade, and the royal neck was therefore the object of
      their particular indignation. Descendants of the belligerents now wear
      their hair all alike, but the fires of animosity enkindled in that ancient
      strife smoulder to this day beneath the snows of British civility.

      SABBATH, n. A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God made
      the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh. Among the Jews
      observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this is the
      Christian version: "Remember the seventh day to make thy neighbor keep it
      wholly." To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient that the Sabbath
      should be the last day of the week, but the Early Fathers of the Church
      held other views. So great is the sanctity of the day that even where the
      Lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down
      to (and down into) the sea it is reverently recognized, as is manifest in
      the following deep-water version of the Fourth Commandment:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,
  And on the seventh holystone the deck and scrape the cable.

      SACRAMENT, n. A solemn religious ceremony to which several degrees of

      the Protestant churches, being less prosperous, feel that they can afford
      only two, and these of inferior sanctity. Some of the smaller sects have
      no sacraments at all&mdash;for which mean economy they will indubitable be
      damned.

      SANDLOTTER, n. A vertebrate mammal holding the political views of Denis
      Kearney, a notorious demagogue of San Francisco, whose audiences gathered
      in the open spaces (sandlots) of the town. True to the traditions of his
      species, this leader of the proletariat was finally bought off by his
      law-and-order enemies, living prosperously silent and dying impenitently
      rich. But before his treason he imposed upon California a constitution
      that was a confection of sin in a diction of solecisms. The similarity
      between the words "sandlotter" and "sansculotte" is problematically
      significant, but indubitably suggestive.

  Once I seen a human ruin
      In an elevator-well,
  And his members was bestrewin'
      All the place where he had fell.

  And I says, apostrophisin'
      That uncommon woful wreck:
  "Your position's so surprisin'
      That I tremble for your neck!"

  Then that ruin, smilin' sadly
      And impressive, up and spoke:
  "Well, I wouldn't tremble badly,
      For it's been a fortnight broke."

  Then, for further comprehension
      Of his attitude, he begs
  I will focus my attention
      On his various arms and legs&mdash;

  How they all are contumacious;
      Where they each, respective, lie;
  How one trotter proves ungracious,
      T'other one an <i>alibi</i>.

  These particulars is mentioned
      For to show his dismal state,
  Which I wasn't first intentioned
      To specifical relate.

  None is worser to be dreaded
      That I ever have heard tell
  Than the gent's who there was spreaded
      In that elevator-well.

  Now this tale is allegoric&mdash;
      It is figurative all,
  For the well is metaphoric
      And the feller didn't fall.

  I opine it isn't moral
      For a writer-man to cheat,
  And despise to wear a laurel
      As was gotten by deceit.

  For 'tis Politics intended
      By the elevator, mind,
  It will boost a person splendid
      If his talent is the kind.

  Col. Bryan had the talent
      (For the busted man is him)
  And it shot him up right gallant
      Till his head begun to swim.

  Then the rope it broke above him
      And he painful come to earth
  Where there's nobody to love him
      For his detrimented worth.

  Though he's livin' none would know him,
      Or at leastwise not as such.
  Moral of this woful poem:

      in his descent he paused, bent his head in thought a moment and at last

      SATIRE, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and
      follies of the author's enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness.
      In this country satire never had more than a sickly and uncertain
      existence, for the soul of it is wit, wherein we are dolefully deficient,
      the humor that we mistake for it, like all humor, being tolerant and
      sympathetic. Moreover, although Americans are "endowed by their Creator"
      with abundant vice and folly, it is not generally known that these are
      reprehensible qualities, wherefore the satirist is popularly regarded as a
      sour-spirited knave, and his ever victim's outcry for codefendants evokes
      a national assent.

      SATYR, n. One of the few characters of the Grecian mythology accorded
      recognition in the Hebrew. (Leviticus, xvii, 7.) The satyr was at first a
      member of the dissolute community acknowledging a loose allegiance with
      Dionysius, but underwent many transformations and improvements. Not
      infrequently he is confounded with the faun, a later and decenter creation
      of the Romans, who was less like a man and more like a goat.

      SCARABAEUS, n. The sacred beetle of the ancient Egyptians, allied to our
      familiar "tumble-bug." It was supposed to symbolize immortality, the fact
      that God knew why giving it its peculiar sanctity. Its habit of incubating
      its eggs in a ball of ordure may also have commended it to the favor of
      the priesthood, and may some day assure it an equal reverence among
      ourselves. True, the American beetle is an inferior beetle, but the

      SCARIFICATION, n. A form of penance practised by the mediaeval pious. The
      rite was performed, sometimes with a knife, sometimes with a hot iron, but
      always, says Arsenius Asceticus, acceptably if the penitent spared himself
      no pain nor harmless disfigurement. Scarification, with other crude
      penances, has now been superseded by benefaction. The founding of a
      library or endowment of a university is said to yield to the penitent a
      sharper and more lasting pain than is conferred by the knife or iron, and
      is therefore a surer means of grace. There are, however, two grave
      objections to it as a penitential method: the good that it does and the
      taint of justice.

      When the great Gichi-Kuktai was Mikado he condemned to
  decapitation Jijiji Ri, a high officer of the Court.  Soon after
  the hour appointed for performance of the rite what was his
  Majesty's surprise to see calmly approaching the throne the man
  who should have been at that time ten minutes dead!
      "Seventeen hundred impossible dragons!" shouted the enraged
  monarch.  "Did I not sentence you to stand in the market-place and
  have your head struck off by the public executioner at three
  o'clock?  And is it not now 3:10?"
      "Son of a thousand illustrious deities," answered the
  condemned minister, "all that you say is so true that the truth is
  a lie in comparison.  But your heavenly Majesty's sunny and
  vitalizing wishes have been pestilently disregarded.  With joy I
  ran and placed my unworthy body in the market-place.  The
  executioner appeared with his bare scimitar, ostentatiously
  whirled it in air, and then, tapping me lightly upon the neck,
  strode away, pelted by the populace, with whom I was ever a
  favorite.  I am come to pray for justice upon his own dishonorable
  and treasonous head."
      "To what regiment of executioners does the black-boweled
  caitiff belong?" asked the Mikado.
      "To the gallant Ninety-eight Hundred and Thirty-seventh&mdash;I
  know the man.  His name is Sakko-Samshi."
      "Let him be brought before me," said the Mikado to an
  attendant, and a half-hour later the culprit stood in the
  Presence.
      "Thou bastard son of a three-legged hunchback without thumbs!"
  roared the sovereign&mdash;"why didst thou but lightly tap the neck
  that it should have been thy pleasure to sever?"
      "Lord of Cranes and Cherry Blooms," replied the executioner,
  unmoved, "command him to blow his nose with his fingers."
      Being commanded, Jijiji Ri laid hold of his nose and trumpeted
  like an elephant, all expecting to see the severed head flung
  violently from him.  Nothing occurred:  the performance prospered
  peacefully to the close, without incident.
      All eyes were now turned on the executioner, who had grown as
  white as the snows on the summit of Fujiama.  His legs trembled
  and his breath came in gasps of terror.
      "Several kinds of spike-tailed brass lions!" he cried; "I am a
  ruined and disgraced swordsman!  I struck the villain feebly
  because in flourishing the scimitar I had accidentally passed it
  through my own neck!  Father of the Moon, I resign my office."
      So saying, he gasped his top-knot, lifted off his head, and
  advancing to the throne laid it humbly at the Mikado's feet.

      SEAL, n. A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest their
      authenticity and authority. Sometimes it is stamped upon wax, and attached
      to the paper, sometimes into the paper itself. Sealing, in this sense, is
      a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with
      cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of
      the authority that they represent. In the British museum are preserved
      many ancient papers, mostly of a sacerdotal character, validated by
      necromantic pentagrams and other devices, frequently initial letters of
      words to conjure with; and in many instances these are attached in the
      same way that seals are appended now. As nearly every reasonless and
      apparently meaningless custom, rite or observance of modern times had
      origin in some remote utility, it is pleasing to note an example of
      ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really
      useful. Our word "sincere" is derived from <i>sine cero</i>, without wax,
      but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the
      absence of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters
      were formerly closed from public scrutiny. Either view of the matter will
      serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis. The initials L.S., commonly
      appended to signatures of legal documents, mean <i>locum sigillis</i>, the
      place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used &mdash;an admirable
      example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish.
      The words <i>locum sigillis</i> are humbly suggested as a suitable motto
      for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a
      sovereign State of the American Union.

      hoped. Unfortunately they quarreled, and one Monday morning when Bowman
      read the paper to prepare himself for his task, he found his work cut out

  John Elmer Pettibone Cajee
  (I write of him with little glee)
  Was just as bad as he could be.

  'Twas frequently remarked:  "I swon!
  The sun has never looked upon
  So bad a man as Neighbor John."

  A sinner through and through, he had
  This added fault:  it made him mad
  To know another man was bad.

  In such a case he thought it right
  To rise at any hour of night
  And quench that wicked person's light.

  Despite the town's entreaties, he
  Would hale him to the nearest tree
  And leave him swinging wide and free.

  Or sometimes, if the humor came,
  A luckless wight's reluctant frame
  Was given to the cheerful flame.

  While it was turning nice and brown,
  All unconcerned John met the frown
  Of that austere and righteous town.

  "How sad," his neighbors said, "that he
  So scornful of the law should be&mdash;
  An anar c, h, i, s, t."

  (That is the way that they preferred
  To utter the abhorrent word,
  So strong the aversion that it stirred.)

  "Resolved," they said, continuing,
  "That Badman John must cease this thing
  Of having his unlawful fling.

  "Now, by these sacred relics"&mdash;here
  Each man had out a souvenir
  Got at a lynching yesteryear&mdash;

  "By these we swear he shall forsake
  His ways, nor cause our hearts to ache
  By sins of rope and torch and stake.

  "We'll tie his red right hand until
  He'll have small freedom to fulfil
  The mandates of his lawless will."

  So, in convention then and there,
  They named him Sheriff.  The affair
  Was opened, it is said, with prayer.

      wisdom, prudence, science, art and, in brief, whatever men ought to know,
      but lost themselves in a maze of quibbles and a fog of words.

      SORCERY, n. The ancient prototype and forerunner of political influence.
      It was, however, deemed less respectable and sometimes was punished by
      torture and death. Augustine Nicholas relates that a poor peasant who had
      been accused of sorcery was put to the torture to compel a confession.
      After enduring a few gentle agonies the suffering simpleton admitted his
      guilt, but naively asked his tormentors if it were not possible to be a
      sorcerer without knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOUL, n. A spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave
      disputation. Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of
      existence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of
      eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became philosophers.
      Plato himself was a philosopher. The souls that had least contemplated
      divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and despots. Dionysius I, who
      had threatened to decapitate the broad-browed philosopher, was a usurper
      and a despot. Plato, doubtless, was not the first to construct a system of
      philosophy that could be quoted against his enemies; certainly he was not
      the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Concerning the nature of the soul," saith the renowned author of <i>Diversiones
      Sanctorum</i>, "there hath been hardly more argument than that of its
      place in the body. Mine own belief is that the soul hath her seat in the
      abdomen&mdash;in which faith we may discern and interpret a truth hitherto
      unintelligible, namely that the glutton is of all men most devout. He is
      said in the Scripture to 'make a god of his belly' &mdash;why, then,
      should he not be pious, having ever his Deity with him to freshen his
      faith? Who so well as he can know the might and majesty that he shrines?
      Truly and soberly, the soul and the stomach are one Divine Entity; and
      such was the belief of Promasius, who nevertheless erred in denying it
      immortality. He had observed that its visible and material substance
      failed and decayed with the rest of the body after death, but of its
      immaterial essence he knew nothing. This is what we call the Appetite, and
      it survives the wreck and reek of mortality, to be rewarded or punished in
      another world, according to what it hath demanded in the flesh. The
      Appetite whose coarse clamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the
      general market and the public refectory shall be cast into eternal famine,
      whilst that which firmly though civilly insisted on ortolans, caviare,
      terrapin, anchovies, <i>pates de foie gras</i> and all such Christian
      comestibles shall flesh its spiritual tooth in the souls of them forever
      and ever, and wreak its divine thirst upon the immortal parts of the
      rarest and richest wines ever quaffed here below. Such is my religious
      faith, though I grieve to confess that neither His Holiness the Pope nor
      His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury (whom I equally and profoundly
      revere) will assent to its dissemination."

      SPOOKER, n. A writer whose imagination concerns itself with supernatural
      phenomena, especially in the doings of spooks. One of the most illustrious
      spookers of our time is Mr. William D. Howells, who introduces a
      well-credentialed reader to as respectable and mannerly a company of
      spooks as one could wish to meet. To the terror that invests the chairman
      of a district school board, the Howells ghost adds something of the
      mystery enveloping a farmer from another township.

      One evening Mr. Rudolph Block, of New York, found himself seated at dinner
      alongside Mr. Percival Pollard, the distinguished critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pollard," said he, "my book, <i>The Biography of a Dead Cow</i>, is
      published anonymously, but you can hardly be ignorant of its authorship.
      Yet in reviewing it you speak of it as the work of the Idiot of the
      Century. Do you think that fair criticism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry, sir," replied the critic, amiably, "but it did not occur
      to me that you really might not wish the public to know who wrote it."

      Mr. W.C. Morrow, who used to live in San Jose, California, was addicted to
      writing ghost stories which made the reader feel as if a stream of
      lizards, fresh from the ice, were streaking it up his back and hiding in
      his hair. San Jose was at that time believed to be haunted by the visible
      spirit of a noted bandit named Vasquez, who had been hanged there. The
      town was not very well lighted, and it is putting it mildly to say that
      San Jose was reluctant to be out o' nights. One particularly dark night
      two gentlemen were abroad in the loneliest spot within the city limits,
      talking loudly to keep up their courage, when they came upon Mr. J.J.
      Owen, a well-known journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Owen," said one, "what brings you here on such a night as this? You
      told me that this is one of Vasquez' favorite haunts! And you are a
      believer. Aren't you afraid to be out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," the journalist replied with a drear autumnal cadence in
      his speech, like the moan of a leaf-laden wind, "I am afraid to be in. I
      have one of Will Morrow's stories in my pocket and I don't dare to go
      where there is light enough to read it."

      Rear-Admiral Schley and Representative Charles F. Joy were standing near
      the Peace Monument, in Washington, discussing the question, Is success a
      failure? Mr. Joy suddenly broke off in the middle of an eloquent sentence,
      exclaiming: "Hello! I've heard that band before. Santlemann's, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't hear any band," said Schley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to think, I don't either," said Joy; "but I see General Miles coming
      down the avenue, and that pageant always affects me in the same way as a
      brass band. One has to scrutinize one's impressions pretty closely, or one
      will mistake their origin."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Admiral was digesting this hasty meal of philosophy General
      Miles passed in review, a spectacle of impressive dignity. When the tail
      of the seeming procession had passed and the two observers had recovered
      from the transient blindness caused by its effulgence&mdash;

    <p>
      "He seems to be enjoying himself," said the Admiral.

      so well."

      The illustrious statesman, Champ Clark, once lived about a mile from the
      village of Jebigue, in Missouri. One day he rode into town on a favorite
      mule, and, hitching the beast on the sunny side of a street, in front of a
      saloon, he went inside in his character of teetotaler, to apprise the
      barkeeper that wine is a mocker. It was a dreadfully hot day. Pretty soon
      a neighbor came in and seeing Clark, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Champ, it is not right to leave that mule out there in the sun. He'll
      roast, sure!&mdash;he was smoking as I passed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, he's all right," said Clark, lightly; "he's an inveterate smoker."
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbor took a lemonade, but shook his head and repeated that it was
      not right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a conspirator. There had been a fire the night before: a stable
      just around the corner had burned and a number of horses had put on their
      immortality, among them a young colt, which was roasted to a rich
      nut-brown. Some of the boys had turned Mr. Clark's mule loose and
      substituted the mortal part of the colt. Presently another man entered the
      saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For mercy's sake!" he said, taking it with sugar, "do remove that mule,
      barkeeper: it smells."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," interposed Clark, "that animal has the best nose in Missouri. But
      if he doesn't mind, you shouldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of human events Mr. Clark went out, and there, apparently,
      lay the incinerated and shrunken remains of his charger. The boys did not
      have any fun out of Mr. Clarke, who looked at the body and, with the
      non-committal expression to which he owes so much of his political
      preferment, went away. But walking home late that night he saw his mule
      standing silent and solemn by the wayside in the misty moonlight.
      Mentioning the name of Helen Blazes with uncommon emphasis, Mr. Clark took
      the back track as hard as ever he could hook it, and passed the night in
      town.

      General H.H. Wotherspoon, president of the Army War College, has a pet
      rib-nosed baboon, an animal of uncommon intelligence but imperfectly
      beautiful. Returning to his apartment one evening, the General was
      surprised and pained to find Adam (for so the creature is named, the
      general being a Darwinian) sitting up for him and wearing his master's
      best uniform coat, epaulettes and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You confounded remote ancestor!" thundered the great strategist, "what do
      you mean by being out of bed after naps?&mdash;and with my coat on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam rose and with a reproachful look got down on all fours in the manner
      of his kind and, scuffling across the room to a table, returned with a
      visiting-card: General Barry had called and, judging by an empty champagne
      bottle and several cigar-stumps, had been hospitably entertained while
      waiting. The general apologized to his faithful progenitor and retired.
      The next day he met General Barry, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spoon, old man, when leaving you last evening I forgot to ask you about
      those excellent cigars. Where did you get them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      General Wotherspoon did not deign to reply, but walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, please," said Barry, moving after him; "I was joking of
      course. Why, I knew it was not you before I had been in the room fifteen
      minutes."

      SUCCESS, n. The one unpardonable sin against one's fellows. In literature,
      and particularly in poetry, the elements of success are exceedingly

      Father Gassalasca Jape, entitled, for some mysterious reason, "John A.

      SUFFRAGE, n. Expression of opinion by means of a ballot. The right of
      suffrage (which is held to be both a privilege and a duty) means, as
      commonly interpreted, the right to vote for the man of another man's
      choice, and is highly prized. Refusal to do so has the bad name of
      "incivism." The incivilian, however, cannot be properly arraigned for his
      crime, for there is no legitimate accuser. If the accuser is himself
      guilty he has no standing in the court of opinion; if not, he profits by
      the crime, for A's abstention from voting gives greater weight to the vote
      of B. By female suffrage is meant the right of a woman to vote as some man
      tells her to. It is based on female responsibility, which is somewhat
      limited. The woman most eager to jump out of her petticoat to assert her
      rights is first to jump back into it when threatened with a switching for
      misusing them.

      gnomes, nymphs and salamanders, which dwelt, respectively, in earth, water
      and fire, all now insalubrious. Sylphs, like fowls of the air, were male

      limitations to set up an independent existence in a world of its own.
      Excepting in its foetal state, Man is without a tail, a privation of which
      he attests an hereditary and uneasy consciousness by the coat-skirt of the
      male and the train of the female, and by a marked tendency to ornament
      that part of his attire where the tail should be, and indubitably once
      was. This tendency is most observable in the female of the species, in
      whom the ancestral sense is strong and persistent. The tailed men
      described by Lord Monboddo are now generally regarded as a product of an

  The Enemy of Human Souls
  Sat grieving at the cost of coals;
  For Hell had been annexed of late,
  And was a sovereign Southern State.

  "It were no more than right," said he,
  "That I should get my fuel free.
  The duty, neither just nor wise,
  Compels me to economize&mdash;
  Whereby my broilers, every one,
  Are execrably underdone.
  What would they have?&mdash;although I yearn
  To do them nicely to a turn,
  I can't afford an honest heat.
  This tariff makes even devils cheat!
  I'm ruined, and my humble trade
  All rascals may at will invade:
  Beneath my nose the public press
  Outdoes me in sulphureousness;
  The bar ingeniously applies
  To my undoing my own lies;
  My medicines the doctors use
  (Albeit vainly) to refuse
  To me my fair and rightful prey
  And keep their own in shape to pay;
  The preachers by example teach
  What, scorning to perform, I teach;
  And statesmen, aping me, all make
  More promises than they can break.
  Against such competition I
  Lift up a disregarded cry.
  Since all ignore my just complaint,
  By Hokey-Pokey!  I'll turn saint!"
  Now, the Republicans, who all
  Are saints, began at once to bawl
  Against <i>his</i> competition; so
  There was a devil of a go!
  They locked horns with him, tete-a-tete
  In acrimonious debate,
  Till Democrats, forlorn and lone,
  Had hopes of coming by their own.
  That evil to avert, in haste
  The two belligerents embraced;
  But since 'twere wicked to relax
  A tittle of the Sacred Tax,
  'Twas finally agreed to grant

  A bounty on each soul that fell

      "Sir Thomas Holt hath taken a cleaver and stricken his cook upon the head,
      so that one side of the head fell upon one shoulder and the other side
      upon the other shoulder." The defendant was acquitted by instruction of

      THEOSOPHY, n. An ancient faith having all the certitude of religion and

      Buddhists, that we live an incalculable number of times on this earth, in
      as many several bodies, because one life is not long enough for our
      complete spiritual development; that is, a single lifetime does not
      suffice for us to become as wise and good as we choose to wish to become.
      To be absolutely wise and good&mdash;that is perfection; and the
      Theosophist is so keen-sighted as to have observed that everything
      desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection. Less competent
      observers are disposed to except cats, which seem neither wiser nor better

      TIGHTS, n. An habiliment of the stage designed to reinforce the general
      acclamation of the press agent with a particular publicity. Public
      attention was once somewhat diverted from this garment to Miss Lillian
      Russell's refusal to wear it, and many were the conjectures as to her
      motive, the guess of Miss Pauline Hall showing a high order of ingenuity
      and sustained reflection. It was Miss Hall's belief that nature had not
      endowed Miss Russell with beautiful legs. This theory was impossible of
      acceptance by the male understanding, but the conception of a faulty
      female leg was of so prodigious originality as to rank among the most
      brilliant feats of philosophical speculation! It is strange that in all
      the controversy regarding Miss Russell's aversion to tights no one seems
      to have thought to ascribe it to what was known among the ancients as
      "modesty." The nature of that sentiment is now imperfectly understood, and
      possibly incapable of exposition with the vocabulary that remains to us.
      The study of lost arts has, however, been recently revived and some of the
      arts themselves recovered. This is an epoch of <i>renaissances</i>, and
      there is ground for hope that the primitive "blush" may be dragged from
      its hiding-place amongst the tombs of antiquity and hissed on to the
      stage.

      TOMB, n. The House of Indifference. Tombs are now by common consent
      invested with a certain sanctity, but when they have been long tenanted it
      is considered no sin to break them open and rifle them, the famous
      Egyptologist, Dr. Huggyns, explaining that a tomb may be innocently
      "glened" as soon as its occupant is done "smellynge," the soul being then
      all exhaled. This reasonable view is now generally accepted by
      archaeologists, whereby the noble science of Curiosity has been greatly
      dignified.

      TOPE, v. To tipple, booze, swill, soak, guzzle, lush, bib, or swig. In the
      individual, toping is regarded with disesteem, but toping nations are in
      the forefront of civilization and power. When pitted against the
      hard-drinking Christians the abstemious Mahometans go down like grass
      before the scythe. In India one hundred thousand beef-eating and
      brandy-and-soda guzzling Britons hold in subjection two hundred and fifty
      million vegetarian abstainers of the same Aryan race. With what an easy
      grace the whisky-loving American pushed the temperate Spaniard out of his
      possessions! From the time when the Berserkers ravaged all the coasts of
      western Europe and lay drunk in every conquered port it has been the same
      way: everywhere the nations that drink too much are observed to fight
      rather well and not too righteously. Wherefore the estimable old ladies
      who abolished the canteen from the American army may justly boast of
      having materially augmented the nation's military power.

      TORTOISE, n. A creature thoughtfully created to supply occasion for the

      TO MY PET TORTOISE
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My friend, you are not graceful&mdash;not at all;
  Your gait's between a stagger and a sprawl.

  Nor are you beautiful:  your head's a snake's
  To look at, and I do not doubt it aches.

  As to your feet, they'd make an angel weep.
  'Tis true you take them in whene'er you sleep.

  No, you're not pretty, but you have, I own,
  A certain firmness&mdash;mostly you're [sic] backbone.

  Firmness and strength (you have a giant's thews)
  Are virtues that the great know how to use&mdash;

  I wish that they did not; yet, on the whole,
  You lack&mdash;excuse my mentioning it&mdash;Soul.

  So, to be candid, unreserved and true,
  I'd rather you were I than I were you.

  Perhaps, however, in a time to be,
  When Man's extinct, a better world may see

  Your progeny in power and control,
  Due to the genesis and growth of Soul.

  So I salute you as a reptile grand
  Predestined to regenerate the land.

  Father of Possibilities, O deign
  To accept the homage of a dying reign!

  In the far region of the unforeknown
  I dream a tortoise upon every throne.

  I see an Emperor his head withdraw
  Into his carapace for fear of Law;

  A King who carries something else than fat,
  Howe'er acceptably he carries that;

  A President not strenuously bent
  On punishment of audible dissent&mdash;

  Who never shot (it were a vain attack)
  An armed or unarmed tortoise in the back;

  Subject and citizens that feel no need
  To make the March of Mind a wild stampede;

  All progress slow, contemplative, sedate,
  And "Take your time" the word, in Church and State.

  O Tortoise, 'tis a happy, happy dream,
  My glorious testudinous regime!

  I wish in Eden you'd brought this about
  By slouching in and chasing Adam out.

      TREE, n. A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal
      apparatus, though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear only a
      negligible fruit, or none at all. When naturally fruited, the tree is a
      beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor in public
      morals. In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit (white and
      black respectively) though not eaten, is agreeable to the public taste
      and, though not exported, profitable to the general welfare. That the
      legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no discovery of Judge Lynch
      (who, indeed, conceded it no primacy over the lamp-post and the
      bridge-girder) is made plain by the following passage from Morryster, who
      antedated him by two centuries:
    </p>

      TRIAL, n. A formal inquiry designed to prove and put upon record the
      blameless characters of judges, advocates and jurors. In order to effect
      this purpose it is necessary to supply a contrast in the person of one who
      is called the defendant, the prisoner, or the accused. If the contrast is
      made sufficiently clear this person is made to undergo such an affliction
      as will give the virtuous gentlemen a comfortable sense of their immunity,
      added to that of their worth. In our day the accused is usually a human
      being, or a socialist, but in mediaeval times, animals, fishes, reptiles
      and insects were brought to trial. A beast that had taken human life, or
      practiced sorcery, was duly arrested, tried and, if condemned, put to
      death by the public executioner. Insects ravaging grain fields, orchards
      or vineyards were cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal, and
      after testimony, argument and condemnation, if they continued <i>in
      contumaciam</i> the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court, where
      they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized. In a street of
      Toledo, some pigs that had wickedly run between the viceroy's legs,
      upsetting him, were arrested on a warrant, tried and punished. In Naples
      an ass was condemned to be burned at the stake, but the sentence appears
      not to have been executed. D'Addosio relates from the court records many
      trials of pigs, bulls, horses, cocks, dogs, goats, etc., greatly, it is
      believed, to the betterment of their conduct and morals. In 1451 a suit
      was brought against the leeches infesting some ponds about Berne, and the
      Bishop of Lausanne, instructed by the faculty of Heidelberg University,
      directed that some of "the aquatic worms" be brought before the local
      magistracy. This was done and the leeches, both present and absent, were
      ordered to leave the places that they had infested within three days on
      pain of incurring "the malediction of God." In the voluminous records of
      this <i>cause celebre</i> nothing is found to show whether the offenders
      braved the punishment, or departed forthwith out of that inhospitable
      jurisdiction.

      TRICHINOSIS, n. The pig's reply to proponents of porcophagy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moses Mendlessohn having fallen ill sent for a Christian physician, who at
      once diagnosed the philosopher's disorder as trichinosis, but tactfully
      gave it another name. "You need an immediate change of diet," he said;
      "you must eat six ounces of pork every other day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pork?" shrieked the patient&mdash;"pork? Nothing shall induce me to touch
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that?" the doctor gravely asked.

      TRINITY, n. In the multiplex theism of certain Christian churches, three
      entirely distinct deities consistent with only one. Subordinate deities of
      the polytheistic faith, such as devils and angels, are not dowered with
      the power of combination, and must urge individually their claims to
      adoration and propitiation. The Trinity is one of the most sublime
      mysteries of our holy religion. In rejecting it because it is
      incomprehensible, Unitarians betray their inadequate sense of theological
      fundamentals. In religion we believe only what we do not understand,
      except in the instance of an intelligible doctrine that contradicts an
      incomprehensible one. In that case we believe the former as a part of the
      latter.

      TROGLODYTE, n. Specifically, a cave-dweller of the paleolithic period,
      after the Tree and before the Flat. A famous community of troglodytes
      dwelt with David in the Cave of Adullam. The colony consisted of "every
      one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one
      that was discontented"&mdash;in brief, all the Socialists of Judah.

      enemies.

      UBIQUITY, n. The gift or power of being in all places at one time, but not
      in all places at all times, which is omnipresence, an attribute of God and
      the luminiferous ether only. This important distinction between ubiquity
      and omnipresence was not clear to the mediaeval Church and there was much
      bloodshed about it. Certain Lutherans, who affirmed the presence
      everywhere of Christ's body were known as Ubiquitarians. For this error
      they were doubtless damned, for Christ's body is present only in the
      eucharist, though that sacrament may be performed in more than one place
      simultaneously. In recent times ubiquity has not always been understood&mdash;not
      even by Sir Boyle Roche, for example, who held that a man cannot be in two
      places at once unless he is a bird.

      UNCTION, n. An oiling, or greasing. The rite of extreme unction consists
      in touching with oil consecrated by a bishop several parts of the body of
      one engaged in dying. Marbury relates that after the rite had been
      administered to a certain wicked English nobleman it was discovered that

    <p>
      W (double U) has, of all the letters in our alphabet, the only cumbrous
      name, the names of the others being monosyllabic. This advantage of the
      Roman alphabet over the Grecian is the more valued after audibly spelling
      out some simple Greek word, like <i>epixoriambikos</i>. Still, it is now
      thought by the learned that other agencies than the difference of the two
      alphabets may have been concerned in the decline of "the glory that was
      Greece" and the rise of "the grandeur that was Rome." There can be no

      inaccessible to the light. "In time of peace prepare for war" has a deeper
      meaning than is commonly discerned; it means, not merely that all things

      that the soil of peace is thickly sown with the seeds of war and
      singularly suited to their germination and growth. It was when Kubla Khan

  Should you ask me whence this laughter,
  Whence this audible big-smiling,
  With its labial extension,
  With its maxillar distortion
  And its diaphragmic rhythmus
  Like the billowing of an ocean,
  Like the shaking of a carpet,
  I should answer, I should tell you:
  From the great deeps of the spirit,
  From the unplummeted abysmus
  Of the soul this laughter welleth
  As the fountain, the gug-guggle,
  Like the river from the canon [sic],
  To entoken and give warning
  That my present mood is sunny.
  Should you ask me further question&mdash;
  Why the great deeps of the spirit,
  Why the unplummeted abysmus
  Of the soule extrudes this laughter,
  This all audible big-smiling,
  I should answer, I should tell you
  With a white heart, tumpitumpy,
  With a true tongue, honest Injun:
  William Bryan, he has Caught It,
  Caught the Whangdepootenawah!

  Is't the sandhill crane, the shankank,
  Standing in the marsh, the kneedeep,
  Standing silent in the kneedeep
  With his wing-tips crossed behind him
  And his neck close-reefed before him,
  With his bill, his william, buried
  In the down upon his bosom,
  With his head retracted inly,
  While his shoulders overlook it?
  Does the sandhill crane, the shankank,
  Shiver grayly in the north wind,
  Wishing he had died when little,
  As the sparrow, the chipchip, does?
  No 'tis not the Shankank standing,
  Standing in the gray and dismal
  Marsh, the gray and dismal kneedeep.
  No, 'tis peerless William Bryan
  Realizing that he's Caught It,
  Caught the Whangdepootenawah!

      WHEAT, n. A cereal from which a tolerably good whisky can with some
      difficulty be made, and which is used also for bread. The French are said
      to eat more bread <i>per capita</i> of population than any other people,
      which is natural, for only they know how to make the stuff palatable.

      WHITE, adj. and n. Black.

      WIDOW, n. A pathetic figure that the Christian world has agreed to take
      humorously, although Christ's tenderness towards widows was one of the
      most marked features of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      WINE, n. Fermented grape-juice known to the Women's Christian Union as
      "liquor," sometimes as "rum." Wine, madam, is God's next best gift to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      WIT, n. The salt with which the American humorist spoils his intellectual
      cookery by leaving it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      WITCH, n. (1) Any ugly and repulsive old woman, in a wicked league with
      the devil. (2) A beautiful and attractive young woman, in wickedness a
      league beyond the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      WITTICISM, n. A sharp and clever remark, usually quoted, and seldom noted;
      what the Philistine is pleased to call a "joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      WOMAN, n.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      An animal usually living in the vicinity of Man, and having a
  rudimentary susceptibility to domestication.  It is credited by
  many of the elder zoologists with a certain vestigial docility
  acquired in a former state of seclusion, but naturalists of the
  postsusananthony period, having no knowledge of the seclusion,
  deny the virtue and declare that such as creation's dawn beheld,
  it roareth now.  The species is the most widely distributed of all
  beasts of prey, infesting all habitable parts of the globe, from
  Greenland's spicy mountains to India's moral strand.  The popular
  name (wolfman) is incorrect, for the creature is of the cat kind.
  The woman is lithe and graceful in its movement, especially the
  American variety (<i>felis pugnans</i>), is omnivorous and can be
  taught not to talk.

      WORMS'-MEAT, n. The finished product of which we are the raw material. The
      contents of the Taj Mahal, the Tombeau Napoleon and the Grantarium.
      Worms'-meat is usually outlasted by the structure that houses it, but
      "this too must pass away." Probably the silliest work in which a human
      being can engage is construction of a tomb for himself. The solemn purpose
      cannot dignify, but only accentuates by contrast the foreknown futility.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ambitious fool! so mad to be a show!
  How profitless the labor you bestow
      Upon a dwelling whose magnificence
  The tenant neither can admire nor know.

  Build deep, build high, build massive as you can,
  The wanton grass-roots will defeat the plan
      By shouldering asunder all the stones
  In what to you would be a moment's span.

  Time to the dead so all unreckoned flies
  That when your marble is all dust, arise,
      If wakened, stretch your limbs and yawn&mdash;
  You'll think you scarcely can have closed your eyes.

  What though of all man's works your tomb alone
  Should stand till Time himself be overthrown?
      Would it advantage you to dwell therein
  Forever as a stain upon a stone?

      WORSHIP, n. Homo Creator's testimony to the sound construction and fine
      finish of Deus Creatus. A popular form of abjection, having an element of
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      WRATH, n. Anger of a superior quality and degree, appropriate to exalted
      characters and momentous occasions; as, "the wrath of God," "the day of
      wrath," etc. Amongst the ancients the wrath of kings was deemed sacred,
      for it could usually command the agency of some god for its fit
      manifestation, as could also that of a priest. The Greeks before Troy were
      so harried by Apollo that they jumped out of the frying-pan of the wrath
      of Chryses into the fire of the wrath of Achilles, though Agamemnon, the
      sole offender, was neither fried nor roasted. A similar noted immunity was
      that of David when he incurred the wrath of Yahveh by numbering his
      people, seventy thousand of whom paid the penalty with their lives. God is
      now Love, and a director of the census performs his work without
      apprehension of disaster.

      X
    </h1>
    <p>
      X in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility to
      the attacks of the spelling reformers, and like them, will doubtless last
      as long as the language. X is the sacred symbol of ten dollars, and in
      such words as Xmas, Xn, etc., stands for Christ, not, as is popular
      supposed, because it represents a cross, but because the corresponding
      letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of his name &mdash;<i>Xristos</i>.
      If it represented a cross it would stand for St. Andrew, who "testified"
      upon one of that shape. In the algebra of psychology x stands for Woman's
      mind. Words beginning with X are Grecian and will not be defined in this
      standard English dictionary.

      ZANY, n. A popular character in old Italian plays, who imitated with
      ludicrous incompetence the <i>buffone</i>, or clown, and was therefore the
      ape of an ape; for the clown himself imitated the serious characters of
      the play. The zany was progenitor to the specialist in humor, as we to-day
      have the unhappiness to know him. In the zany we see an example of
      creation; in the humorist, of transmission. Another excellent specimen of
      the modern zany is the curate, who apes the rector, who apes the bishop,
      who apes the archbishop, who apes the devil.

    <p>
      ZANZIBARI, n. An inhabitant of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, off the eastern
      coast of Africa. The Zanzibaris, a warlike people, are best known in this
      country through a threatening diplomatic incident that occurred a few
      years ago. The American consul at the capital occupied a dwelling that
      faced the sea, with a sandy beach between. Greatly to the scandal of this
      official's family, and against repeated remonstrances of the official
      himself, the people of the city persisted in using the beach for bathing.
      One day a woman came down to the edge of the water and was stooping to
      remove her attire (a pair of sandals) when the consul, incensed beyond
      restraint, fired a charge of bird-shot into the most conspicuous part of
      her person. Unfortunately for the existing <i>entente cordiale</i> between
      two great nations, she was the Sultana.

      ZEAL, n. A certain nervous disorder afflicting the young and

      ZENITH, n. The point in the heavens directly overhead to a man standing or
      a growing cabbage. A man in bed or a cabbage in the pot is not considered
      as having a zenith, though from this view of the matter there was once a
      considerably dissent among the learned, some holding that the posture of
      the body was immaterial. These were called Horizontalists, their
      opponents, Verticalists. The Horizontalist heresy was finally extinguished
      by Xanobus, the philosopher-king of Abara, a zealous Verticalist. Entering
      an assembly of philosophers who were debating the matter, he cast a
      severed human head at the feet of his opponents and asked them to
      determine its zenith, explaining that its body was hanging by the heels
      outside. Observing that it was the head of their leader, the
      Horizontalists hastened to profess themselves converted to whatever
      opinion the Crown might be pleased to hold, and Horizontalism took its
      place among <i>fides defuncti</i>.

      ZEUS, n. The chief of Grecian gods, adored by the Romans as Jupiter and by
      the modern Americans as God, Gold, Mob and Dog. Some explorers who have
      touched upon the shores of America, and one who professes to have
      penetrated a considerable distance to the interior, have thought that
      these four names stand for as many distinct deities, but in his monumental
      work on Surviving Faiths, Frumpp insists that the natives are monotheists,

      come down to us. Two of the science's most illustrious expounders were
      Buffon and Oliver Goldsmith, from both of whom we learn (<i>L'Histoire

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
