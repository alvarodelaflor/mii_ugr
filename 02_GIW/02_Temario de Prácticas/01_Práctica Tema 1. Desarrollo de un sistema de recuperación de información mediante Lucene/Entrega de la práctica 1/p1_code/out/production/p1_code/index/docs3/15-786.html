<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>BOOK THE
FIRST<br />
<i>SOWING</i></h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ONE THING NEEDFUL</span></h3>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Now</span>, what I want is,
Facts.&nbsp; Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts.&nbsp;
Facts alone are wanted in life.&nbsp; Plant nothing else, and
root out everything else.&nbsp; You can only form the minds of
reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any
service to them.&nbsp; This is the principle on which I bring up
my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up
these children.&nbsp; Stick to Facts, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a
school-room, and the speaker&rsquo;s square forefinger emphasized
his observations by underscoring every sentence with a line on
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s sleeve.&nbsp; The emphasis was helped by
the speaker&rsquo;s square wall of a forehead, which had his
eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage
in two dark caves, overshadowed by the wall.&nbsp; The emphasis
was helped by the speaker&rsquo;s mouth, which was wide, thin,
and hard set.&nbsp; The emphasis was helped by the
speaker&rsquo;s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and
dictatorial.&nbsp; The emphasis was helped by the speaker&rsquo;s
hair, which bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation
of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered
with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had
scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside.&nbsp;
The speaker&rsquo;s obstinate carriage, square coat, square legs,
square shoulders,&mdash;nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take
him by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn
fact, as it was,&mdash;all helped the emphasis.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>&lsquo;In
this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but
Facts!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person
present, all backed a little, and swept with their eyes the
inclined plane of little vessels then and there arranged in
order, ready to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them
until they were full to the brim.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MURDERING THE INNOCENTS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Gradgrind</span>, sir.&nbsp; A man
of realities.&nbsp; A man of facts and calculations.&nbsp; A man
who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four, and
nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for
anything over.&nbsp; Thomas Gradgrind, sir&mdash;peremptorily
Thomas&mdash;Thomas Gradgrind.&nbsp; With a rule and a pair of
scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, sir,
ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell
you exactly what it comes to.&nbsp; It is a mere question of
figures, a case of simple arithmetic.&nbsp; You might hope to get
some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind,
or Augustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind
(all supposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of
Thomas Gradgrind&mdash;no, sir!</p>
<p>In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced
himself, whether to his private circle of acquaintance, or to the
public in general.&nbsp; In such terms, no doubt, substituting
the words &lsquo;boys and girls,&rsquo; for &lsquo;sir,&rsquo;
Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little
pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of facts.</p>
<p>Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage
before mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle
with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of
childhood at one discharge.&nbsp; He seemed a galvanizing
apparatus, too, charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the
tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Girl number twenty,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely
pointing with his square forefinger, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know
that girl.&nbsp; Who is that girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sissy Jupe, sir,&rsquo; explained number twenty,
blushing, standing up, and curtseying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sissy is not a name,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call yourself Sissy.&nbsp; Call yourself
Cecilia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s father as calls me Sissy, sir,&rsquo;
returned the young girl in a trembling voice, and with another
curtsey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he has no business to do it,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell him he mustn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Cecilia
Jupe.&nbsp; Let me see.&nbsp; What is your father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please,
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling
with his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want to know anything about that,
here.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t tell us about that, here.&nbsp;
Your father breaks horses, don&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir, when they can get any to break,
they do break horses in the ring, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t tell us about the ring, here.&nbsp;
Very well, then.&nbsp; Describe your father as a
horsebreaker.&nbsp; He doctors sick horses, I dare
say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then.&nbsp; He is a veterinary surgeon, a
farrier, and horsebreaker.&nbsp; Give me your definition of a
horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this
demand.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!&rsquo;
said Mr. Gradgrind, for the general behoof of all the little
pitchers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Girl number twenty possessed of no facts,
in reference to one of the commonest of animals!&nbsp; Some
boy&rsquo;s definition of a horse.&nbsp; Bitzer,
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on
Bitzer, perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of
sunlight which, darting in at one of the bare windows of the
intensely white-washed room, irradiated Sissy.&nbsp; For, the
boys and girls sat on the face of the inclined plane in two
compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow interval; and
Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came in
for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the
corner of a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught
the end.&nbsp; But, whereas the girl was so dark-eyed and
dark-haired, that she seemed to receive a deeper and more
lustrous colour from the sun, when it shone upon her, the boy was
so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same rays appeared
to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed.&nbsp;
His cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends
of lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with
something paler than themselves, expressed their form.&nbsp; His
short-cropped hair might have been a mere continuation of the
sandy freckles on his forehead and face.&nbsp; His skin was so
unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge, that he looked as
though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bitzer,&rsquo; said Thomas Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
definition of a horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quadruped.&nbsp; Graminivorous.&nbsp; Forty teeth,
namely twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and twelve
incisive.&nbsp; Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries,
sheds hoofs, too.&nbsp; Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with
iron.&nbsp; Age known by marks in mouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus (and
much more) Bitzer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now girl number twenty,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know what a horse is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she
could have blushed deeper than she had blushed all this
time.&nbsp; Bitzer, after rapidly blinking at Thomas Gradgrind
with both eyes at once, and so catching the light upon his
quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antenn&aelig;
of busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and
sat down again.</p>
<p>The third gentleman now stepped forth.&nbsp; A mighty man at
cutting and drying, he was; a government officer; in his way (and
in most other people&rsquo;s too), a professed pugilist; always
in training, always with a system to force down the general
throat like a bolus, always to be heard of at the bar of his
little Public-office, ready to fight all England.&nbsp; To
continue in fistic phraseology, he had a genius for coming up to
the scratch, wherever and whatever it was, and proving himself an
ugly customer.&nbsp; He would go in and damage any subject
whatever with his right, follow up with his left, stop, exchange,
counter, bore his opponent (he always fought All England) to the
ropes, and fall upon him neatly.&nbsp; He was certain to knock
the wind out of common sense, and render that unlucky adversary
deaf to the call of time.&nbsp; And he had it in charge from high
authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium, when
Commissioners should reign upon earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said this gentleman, briskly smiling,
and folding his arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a horse.&nbsp;
Now, let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a room with
representations of horses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus,
&lsquo;Yes, sir!&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon which the other half, seeing
in the gentleman&rsquo;s face that Yes was wrong, cried out in
chorus, &lsquo;No, sir!&rsquo;&mdash;as the custom is, in these
examinations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, No.&nbsp; Why wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A pause.&nbsp; One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of
breathing, ventured the answer, Because he wouldn&rsquo;t paper a
room at all, but would paint it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You <i>must</i> paper it,&rsquo; said the gentleman,
rather warmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must paper it,&rsquo; said Thomas Gradgrind,
&lsquo;whether you like it or not.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell
<i>us</i> you wouldn&rsquo;t paper it.&nbsp; What do you mean,
boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll explain to you, then,&rsquo; said the
gentleman, after another and a dismal pause, &lsquo;why you
wouldn&rsquo;t paper a room with representations of horses.&nbsp;
Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in
reality&mdash;in fact?&nbsp; Do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir!&rsquo; from one half.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
sir!&rsquo; from the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course no,&rsquo; said the gentleman, with an
indignant look at the wrong half.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, then, you are
not to see anywhere, what you don&rsquo;t see in fact; you are
not to have anywhere, what you don&rsquo;t have in fact.&nbsp;
What is called Taste, is only another name for Fact.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thomas Gradgrind nodded his approbation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a new principle, a discovery, a great
discovery,&rsquo; said the gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
I&rsquo;ll try you again.&nbsp; Suppose you were going to carpet
a room.&nbsp; Would you use a carpet having a representation of
flowers upon it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There being a general conviction by this time that &lsquo;No,
sir!&rsquo; was always the right answer to this gentleman, the
chorus of <span class="smcap">No</span> was very strong.&nbsp;
Only a few feeble stragglers said Yes: among them Sissy Jupe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Girl number twenty,&rsquo; said the gentleman, smiling
in the calm strength of knowledge.</p>
<p>Sissy blushed, and stood up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you would carpet your room&mdash;or your
husband&rsquo;s room, if you were a grown woman, and had a
husband&mdash;with representations of flowers, would you?&rsquo;
said the gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why would you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,&rsquo;
returned the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon
them, and have people walking over them with heavy
boots?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt them, sir.&nbsp; They
wouldn&rsquo;t crush and wither, if you please, sir.&nbsp; They
would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant, and I
would fancy&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, ay!&nbsp; But you mustn&rsquo;t fancy,&rsquo;
cried the gentleman, quite elated by coming so happily to his
point.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; You are never to
fancy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not, Cecilia Jupe,&rsquo; Thomas Gradgrind
solemnly repeated, &lsquo;to do anything of that kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fact, fact, fact!&rsquo; said the gentleman.&nbsp; And
&lsquo;Fact, fact, fact!&rsquo; repeated Thomas Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are to be in all things regulated and
governed,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;by fact.&nbsp; We
hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of
commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people
of fact, and of nothing but fact.&nbsp; You must discard the word
Fancy altogether.&nbsp; You have nothing to do with it.&nbsp; You
are not to have, in any object of use or ornament, what would be
a contradiction in fact.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t walk upon flowers
in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in
carpets.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t find that foreign birds and
butterflies come and perch upon your crockery; you cannot be
permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your
crockery.&nbsp; You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down
walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls.&nbsp;
You must use,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;for all these
purposes, combinations and modifications (in primary colours) of
mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and
demonstration.&nbsp; This is the new discovery.&nbsp; This is
fact.&nbsp; This is taste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl curtseyed, and sat down.&nbsp; She was very young,
and she <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>looked as if she were frightened by the matter-of-fact
prospect the world afforded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, if Mr. M&rsquo;Choakumchild,&rsquo; said the
gentleman, &lsquo;will proceed to give his first lesson here, Mr.
Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request, to observe his mode
of procedure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
M&rsquo;Choakumchild, we only wait for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, Mr. M&rsquo;Choakumchild began in his best manner.&nbsp;
He and some one hundred and forty other schoolmasters, had been
lately turned at the same time, in the same factory, on the same
principles, like so many pianoforte legs.&nbsp; He had been put
through an immense variety of paces, and had answered volumes of
head-breaking questions.&nbsp; Orthography, etymology, syntax,
and prosody, biography, astronomy, geography, and general
cosmography, the sciences of compound proportion, algebra,
land-surveying and levelling, vocal music, and drawing from
models, were all at the ends of his ten chilled fingers.&nbsp; He
had worked his stony way into Her Majesty&rsquo;s most Honourable
Privy Council&rsquo;s Schedule B, and had taken the bloom off the
higher branches of mathematics and physical science, French,
German, Latin, and Greek.&nbsp; He knew all about all the Water
Sheds of all the world (whatever they are), and all the histories
of all the peoples, and all the names of all the rivers and
mountains, and all the productions, manners, and customs of all
the countries, and all their boundaries and bearings on the two
and thirty points of the compass.&nbsp; Ah, rather overdone,
M&rsquo;Choakumchild.&nbsp; If he had only learnt a little less,
how infinitely better he might have taught much more!</p>
<p>He went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike
Morgiana in the Forty Thieves: looking into all the vessels
ranged before him, one after another, to see what they
contained.&nbsp; Say, good M&rsquo;Choakumchild.&nbsp; When from
thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by,
dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber
Fancy lurking within&mdash;or sometimes only maim him and distort
him!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A LOOPHOLE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Gradgrind</span> walked homeward from
the school, in a state of considerable satisfaction.&nbsp; It was
his school, and he intended it to be a model.&nbsp; He intended
every child in it to be a model&mdash;just as the young
Gradgrinds were all models.</p>
<p>There were five young Gradgrinds, and they were models every
one.&nbsp; They had been lectured at, from their tenderest years;
coursed, like little hares.&nbsp; Almost as soon as they could
run alone, they had been made to run to the lecture-room.&nbsp;
The first object with which they had an association, or of which
they had a remembrance, was a large black board with a dry Ogre
chalking ghastly white figures on it.</p>
<p>Not that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre
Fact forbid!&nbsp; I only use the word to express a monster in a
lecturing castle, with Heaven knows how many heads manipulated
into one, taking childhood captive, and dragging it into gloomy
statistical dens by the hair.</p>
<p>No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was
up in the moon before it could speak distinctly.&nbsp; No little
Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle, Twinkle, twinkle,
little star; how I wonder what you are!&nbsp; No little Gradgrind
had ever known wonder on the subject, each little Gradgrind
having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a
Professor Owen, and driven Charles&rsquo;s Wain like a locomotive
engine-driver.&nbsp; No little Gradgrind had ever associated a
cow in a field with that famous cow with the crumpled horn who
tossed the dog who worried the cat who killed the rat who ate the
malt, or with that yet more famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb:
it had never heard of those celebrities, and had only been
introduced to a cow as a graminivorous ruminating quadruped with
several stomachs.</p>
<p>To his matter-of-fact home, which was called Stone Lodge, Mr.
Gradgrind directed his steps.&nbsp; He had virtually retired from
the wholesale hardware trade before he built Stone Lodge, and was
now looking about for a suitable opportunity of making an
arithmetical figure in Parliament.&nbsp; Stone Lodge was situated
on a moor within a mile or two of a great town&mdash;called
Coketown in the present faithful guide-book.</p>
<p>A very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge
was.&nbsp; Not the least disguise toned down or shaded off that
uncompromising fact in the landscape.&nbsp; A great square house,
with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows, as its
master&rsquo;s heavy brows overshadowed his eyes.&nbsp; A
calculated, cast up, balanced, and proved house.&nbsp; Six
windows on this side of the door, six on that side; a total of
twelve in this wing, a total of twelve in the other wing;
four-and-twenty carried over to the back wings.&nbsp; A lawn and
garden and an infant avenue, all ruled straight like a botanical
account-book.&nbsp; Gas and ventilation, drainage and
water-service, all of the primest quality.&nbsp; Iron clamps and
girders, fire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the
housemaids, with all their brushes and brooms; everything that
heart could desire.</p>
<p>Everything?&nbsp; Well, I suppose so.&nbsp; The little
Gradgrinds had cabinets in various departments of science
too.&nbsp; They had a little conchological cabinet, and a little
metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical cabinet; and
the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits of
stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from
the parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments
their own names; and, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter
Piper, who had never found his way into their nursery, If the
greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this, what was it
for good gracious goodness&rsquo; sake, that the greedy little
Gradgrinds grasped it!</p>
<p>Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of
mind.&nbsp; He was an affectionate father, after his manner; but
he would probably have described himself (if he had been put,
like Sissy Jupe, upon a definition) as &lsquo;an eminently
practical&rsquo; father.&nbsp; He had a particular pride in the
phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a
special application to him.&nbsp; Whatsoever the public meeting
held in Coketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting,
some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his
eminently practical friend Gradgrind.&nbsp; This always pleased
the eminently practical friend.&nbsp; He knew it to be his due,
but his due was acceptable.</p>
<p>He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the
town, which was neither town nor country, and yet was either
spoiled, when his ears were invaded by the sound of music.&nbsp;
The clashing and banging band attached to the horse-riding
establishment, which had there set up its rest in a wooden
pavilion, was in full bray.&nbsp; A flag, floating from the
summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was
&lsquo;Sleary&rsquo;s Horse-riding&rsquo; which claimed their
suffrages.&nbsp; Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a
money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche of early
Gothic architecture, took the money.&nbsp; Miss Josephine Sleary,
as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill
announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her
graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act.&nbsp; Among the other
pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to
be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to &lsquo;elucidate
the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing
dog Merrylegs.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was also to exhibit &lsquo;his
astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid
succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of
solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or
any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous
plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be
withdrawn.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same Signor Jupe was to
&lsquo;enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with
his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lastly, he
was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of
Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in &lsquo;the highly novel
and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor&rsquo;s Journey to
Brentford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course,
but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either
brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them
to the House of Correction.&nbsp; But, the turning of the road
took him by the back of the booth, and at the back of the booth a
number of children were congregated in a number of stealthy
attitudes, striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the
place.</p>
<p>This brought him to a stop.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, to think of
these vagabonds,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;attracting the young
rabble from a model school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and
the young rabble, he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to
look for any child he knew by name, and might order off.&nbsp;
Phenomenon almost incredible though distinctly seen, what did he
then behold but his own metallurgical Louisa, peeping with all
her might through a hole in a deal board, and his own
mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a
hoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act!</p>
<p>Dumb with amazement, Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where
his family was thus disgraced, laid his hand upon each erring
child, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa!!&nbsp; Thomas!!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Both rose, red and disconcerted.&nbsp; But, Louisa looked at
her father with more boldness than Thomas did.&nbsp; Indeed,
Thomas did not look at him, but gave himself up to be taken home
like a machine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!&rsquo; said
Mr. Gradgrind, leading each away by a hand; &lsquo;what do you do
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wanted to see what it was like,&rsquo; returned Louisa,
shortly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What it was like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was an air of jaded sullenness in them both, and
particularly in the girl: yet, struggling through the
dissatisfaction of her face, there was a light with nothing to
rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a starved imagination
keeping life in itself somehow, which brightened its
expression.&nbsp; Not with the brightness natural to cheerful
youth, but with uncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had
something painful in them, analogous to the changes on a blind
face groping its way.</p>
<p>She was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant
day would seem to become a woman all at once.&nbsp; Her father
thought so as he looked at her.&nbsp; She was pretty.&nbsp; Would
have been self-willed (he thought in his eminently practical way)
but for her bringing-up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it
difficult to believe that you, with your education and resources,
should have brought your sister to a scene like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&lsquo;I brought <i>him</i>, father,&rsquo; said Louisa,
quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I asked him to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to hear it.&nbsp; I am very sorry indeed to
hear it.&nbsp; It makes Thomas no better, and it makes you worse,
Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her
cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&nbsp; Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the
sciences is open; Thomas and you, who may be said to be replete
with facts; Thomas and you, who have been trained to mathematical
exactness; Thomas and you, here!&rsquo; cried Mr.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;In this degraded position!&nbsp; I am
amazed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was tired, father.&nbsp; I have been tired a long
time,&rsquo; said Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tired?&nbsp; Of what?&rsquo; asked the astonished
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know of what&mdash;of everything, I
think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say not another word,&rsquo; returned Mr.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are childish.&nbsp; I will hear no
more.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not speak again until they had walked
some half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with:
&lsquo;What would your best friends say, Louisa?&nbsp; Do you
attach no value to their good opinion?&nbsp; What would Mr.
Bounderby say?&rsquo;&nbsp; At the mention of this name, his
daughter stole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and
searching character.&nbsp; He saw nothing of it, for before he
looked at her, she had again cast down her eyes!</p>
<p>&lsquo;What,&rsquo; he repeated presently, &lsquo;would Mr.
Bounderby say?&rsquo;&nbsp; All the way to Stone Lodge, as with
grave indignation he led the two delinquents home, he repeated at
intervals &lsquo;What would Mr. Bounderby say?&rsquo;&mdash;as if
Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. BOUNDERBY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> being Mrs. Grundy, who
<i>was</i> Mr. Bounderby?</p>
<p>Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind&rsquo;s
bosom friend, as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach
that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid
of sentiment.&nbsp; So near was Mr. Bounderby&mdash;or, if the
reader should prefer it, so far off.</p>
<p>He was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what
not.&nbsp; A big, loud man, with a stare, and a metallic
laugh.&nbsp; A man made out of a coarse material, which seemed to
have been stretched to make so much of him.&nbsp; A man with a
great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins in his temples, and
such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes
open, and lift his eyebrows up.&nbsp; A man with a pervading
appearance on him of being inflated like a balloon, and ready to
start.&nbsp; A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a
self-made man.&nbsp; A man who was always proclaiming, through
that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his, his old ignorance
and his old poverty.&nbsp; A man who was the Bully of
humility.</p>
<p>A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend, Mr.
Bounderby looked older; his seven or eight and forty might have
had the seven or eight added to it again, without surprising
anybody.&nbsp; He had not much hair.&nbsp; One might have fancied
he had talked it off; and that what was left, all standing up in
disorder, was in that condition from being constantly blown about
by his windy boastfulness.</p>
<p>In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing on the
hearthrug, warming himself before the fire, Mr. Bounderby
delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance
of its being his birthday.&nbsp; He stood before the fire, partly
because it was a cool spring afternoon, though the sun shone;
partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the
ghost of damp mortar; partly because he thus took up a commanding
position, from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hadn&rsquo;t a shoe to my foot.&nbsp; As to a
stocking, I didn&rsquo;t know such a thing by name.&nbsp; I
passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the way I spent my tenth birthday.&nbsp; Not that a
ditch was new to me, for I was born in a ditch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of
shawls, of surpassing feebleness, mental and bodily; who was
always taking physic without any effect, and who, whenever she
showed a symptom of coming to life, was invariably stunned by
some weighty piece of fact tumbling on her; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped
it was a dry ditch?</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; As wet as a sop.&nbsp; A foot of water in
it,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enough to give a baby cold,&rsquo; Mrs. Gradgrind
considered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cold?&nbsp; I was born with inflammation of the lungs,
and of everything else, I believe, that was capable of
inflammation,&rsquo; returned Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
years, ma&rsquo;am, I was one of the most miserable little
wretches ever seen.&nbsp; I was so sickly, that I was always
moaning and groaning.&nbsp; I was so ragged and dirty, that you
wouldn&rsquo;t have touched me with a pair of tongs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most
appropriate thing her imbecility could think of doing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How I fought through it, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
know,&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was determined, I
suppose.&nbsp; I have been a determined character in later life,
and I suppose I was then.&nbsp; Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind,
anyhow, and nobody to thank for my being here, but
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his
mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>My</i> mother?&nbsp; Bolted, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo;
said Bounderby.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it
up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mother left me to my grandmother,&rsquo; said
Bounderby; &lsquo;and, according to the best of my remembrance,
my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that
ever lived.&nbsp; If I got a little pair of shoes by any chance,
she would take &rsquo;em off and sell &rsquo;em for drink.&nbsp;
Why, I have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and
drink her four-teen glasses of liquor before
breakfast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of
vitality, looked (as she always did) like an indifferently
executed transparency of a small female figure, without enough
light behind it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She kept a chandler&rsquo;s shop,&rsquo; pursued
Bounderby, &lsquo;and kept me in an egg-box.&nbsp; That was the
cot of <i>my</i> infancy; an old egg-box.&nbsp; As soon as I was
big enough to run away, of course I ran away.&nbsp; Then I became
a young vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about
and starving me, everybody of all ages knocked me about and
starved me.&nbsp; They were right; they had no business to do
anything else.&nbsp; I was a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a
pest.&nbsp; I know that very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a
great social distinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and
a pest, was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of
the boast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; Whether I was to do it or not, ma&rsquo;am, I
did it.&nbsp; I pulled through it, though nobody threw me out a
rope.&nbsp; Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter,
clerk, chief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of
Coketown.&nbsp; Those are the antecedents, and the
culmination.&nbsp; Josiah Bounderby of Coketown learnt his
letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and was
first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the
steeple clock of St. Giles&rsquo;s Church, London, under the
direction of a drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an
incorrigible vagrant.&nbsp; Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of
your district schools and your model schools, and your training
schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish of schools; and Josiah
Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all right, all
correct&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t such advantages&mdash;but let us
have hard-headed, solid-fisted people&mdash;the education that
made him won&rsquo;t do for everybody, he knows well&mdash;such
and such his education was, however, and you may force him to
swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress
the facts of his life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Being heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby
of Coketown stopped.&nbsp; He stopped just as his eminently
practical friend, still accompanied by the two young culprits,
entered the room.&nbsp; His eminently practical friend, on seeing
him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a reproachful look that
plainly said, &lsquo;Behold your Bounderby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; blustered Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; What is young Thomas in the
dumps about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were peeping at the circus,&rsquo; muttered Louisa,
haughtily, without lifting up her eyes, &lsquo;and father caught
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Mrs. Gradgrind,&rsquo; said her husband in a lofty
manner, &lsquo;I should as soon have expected to find my children
reading poetry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How can you, Louisa and Thomas!&nbsp; I wonder at
you.&nbsp; I declare you&rsquo;re enough to make one regret ever
having had a family at all.&nbsp; I have a great mind to say I
wish I hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> what would you have done,
I should like to know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these
cogent remarks.&nbsp; He frowned impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you
couldn&rsquo;t go and look at the shells and minerals and things
provided for you, instead of circuses!&rsquo; said Mrs.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know, as well as I do, no young
people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or
attend lectures about circuses.&nbsp; What can you possibly want
to know of circuses then?&nbsp; I am sure you have enough to do,
if that&rsquo;s what you want.&nbsp; With my head in its present
state, I couldn&rsquo;t remember the mere names of half the facts
you have got to attend to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the reason!&rsquo; pouted Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that&rsquo;s the reason, because it
can&rsquo;t be nothing of the sort,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go and be somethingological
directly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific
character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies
with this general injunction to choose their pursuit.</p>
<p>In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind&rsquo;s stock of facts in general was
woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high
matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons.&nbsp;
Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and,
secondly, she had &lsquo;no nonsense&rsquo; about her.&nbsp; By
nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free
from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at
the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.</p>
<p>The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband
and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady
again without collision between herself and any other fact.&nbsp;
So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bounderby,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair
to the fireside, &lsquo;you are always so interested in my young
people&mdash;particularly in Louisa&mdash;that I make no apology
for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this discovery.&nbsp;
I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the
education of the reason of my family.&nbsp; The reason is (as you
know) the only faculty to which education should be
addressed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet, Bounderby, it would appear from
this unexpected circumstance of to-day, though in itself a
trifling one, as if something had crept into Thomas&rsquo;s and
Louisa&rsquo;s minds which is&mdash;or rather, which is
not&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that I can express myself better
than by saying&mdash;which has never been intended to be
developed, and in which their reason has no part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There certainly is no reason in looking with interest
at a parcel of vagabonds,&rsquo; returned Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When I was a vagabond myself, nobody looked with any
interest at <i>me</i>; I know that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then comes the question; said the eminently practical
father, with his eyes on the fire, &lsquo;in what has this vulgar
curiosity its rise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in what.&nbsp; In idle
imagination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; said the eminently practical;
&lsquo;I confess, however, that the misgiving <i>has</i> crossed
me on my way home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In idle imagination, Gradgrind,&rsquo; repeated
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;A very bad thing for anybody, but a
cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa.&nbsp; I should ask Mrs.
Gradgrind&rsquo;s pardon for strong expressions, but that she
knows very well I am not a refined character.&nbsp; Whoever
expects refinement in <i>me</i> will be disappointed.&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t a refined bringing up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether,&rsquo; said Gradgrind, pondering with his
hands in his pockets, and his cavernous eyes on the fire,
&lsquo;whether any instructor or servant can have suggested
anything?&nbsp; Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading
anything?&nbsp; Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle
story-book can have got into the house?&nbsp; Because, in minds
that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the
cradle upwards, this is so curious, so
incomprehensible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop a bit!&rsquo; cried Bounderby, who all this time
had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very
furniture of the room with explosive humility.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have one of those strollers&rsquo; children in the
school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cecilia Jupe, by name,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, with
something of a stricken look at his friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, stop a bit!&rsquo; cried Bounderby again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How did she come there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first
time, only just now.&nbsp; She specially applied here at the
house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town,
and&mdash;yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are
right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, stop a bit!&rsquo; cried Bounderby, once
more.&nbsp; &lsquo;Louisa saw her when she came?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the
application to me.&nbsp; But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in
Mrs. Gradgrind&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;what passed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my poor health!&rsquo; returned Mrs.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;The girl wanted to come to the school,
and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa
and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr.
Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to
contradict them when such was the fact!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!&rsquo; said Mr.
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Turn this girl to the right about, and
there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am much of your opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do it at once,&rsquo; said Bounderby, &lsquo;has always
been my motto from a child.&nbsp; When I thought I would run away
from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did it at once.&nbsp; Do
you the same.&nbsp; Do this at once!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you walking?&rsquo; asked his friend.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have the father&rsquo;s address.&nbsp; Perhaps you would
not mind walking to town with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the least in the world,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;as long as you do it at once!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat&mdash;he always threw it
on, as expressing a man who had been far too busily employed in
making himself, to acquire any fashion of wearing his
hat&mdash;and with his hands in his pockets, sauntered out into
the hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never wear gloves,&rsquo; it was his
custom to say.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t climb up the ladder in
<i>them</i>.&mdash;Shouldn&rsquo;t be so high up, if I
had.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr.
Gradgrind went up-stairs for the address, he opened the door of
the children&rsquo;s study and looked into that serene
floor-clothed apartment, which, notwithstanding its book-cases
and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical
appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to
hair-cutting.&nbsp; Louisa languidly leaned upon the window
looking out, without looking at anything, while young Thomas
stood sniffing revengefully at the fire.&nbsp; Adam Smith and
Malthus, two younger Gradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody;
and little Jane, after manufacturing a good deal of moist
pipe-clay on her face with slate-pencil and tears, had fallen
asleep over vulgar fractions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right now, Louisa: it&rsquo;s all right,
young Thomas,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby; &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t
do so any more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer for it&rsquo;s being all
over with father.&nbsp; Well, Louisa, that&rsquo;s worth a kiss,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,&rsquo; returned
Louisa, when she had coldly paused, and slowly walked across the
room, and <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>ungraciously raised her cheek towards him, with her face
turned away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always my pet; ain&rsquo;t you, Louisa?&rsquo; said Mr.
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-bye, Louisa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the
cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning
red.&nbsp; She was still doing this, five minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you about, Loo?&rsquo; her brother sulkily
remonstrated.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll rub a hole in your
face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you
like, Tom.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t cry!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE KEYNOTE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Coketown</span>, to which Messrs.
Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a triumph of fact; it had
no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind
herself.&nbsp; Let us strike the key-note, Coketown, before
pursuing our tune.</p>
<p>It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been
red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood,
it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of
a savage.&nbsp; It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out
of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for
ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.&nbsp; It had a black canal
in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and
vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling
and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the
steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an
elephant in a state of melancholy madness.&nbsp; It contained
several large streets all very like one another, and many small
streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally
like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with
the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and
to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to-morrow, and
every year the counterpart of the last and the next.</p>
<p>These attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from
the work by which it was sustained; against them were to be set
off, comforts of life which found their way all over the world,
and elegancies of life which made, we will not ask how much of
the fine lady, who could scarcely bear to hear the place
mentioned.&nbsp; The rest of its features were voluntary, and
they were these.</p>
<p>You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely
workful.&nbsp; If the members of a religious persuasion built a
chapel there&mdash;as the members of eighteen religious
persuasions had done&mdash;they made it a pious warehouse of red
brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly ornamental
examples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.&nbsp; The
solitary exception was the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a
square steeple over the door, terminating in four short pinnacles
like florid wooden legs.&nbsp; All the public inscriptions in the
town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and
white.&nbsp; The jail might have been the infirmary, the
infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been
either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to
the contrary in the graces of their construction.&nbsp; Fact,
fact, fact, everywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact,
fact, fact, everywhere in the immaterial.&nbsp; The
M&rsquo;Choakumchild school was all fact, and the school of
design was all fact, and the relations between master and man
were all fact, and everything was fact between the lying-in
hospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn&rsquo;t state in
figures, or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and
saleable in the dearest, was not, and never should be, world
without end, Amen.</p>
<p>A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion,
of course got on well?&nbsp; Why no, not quite well.&nbsp;
No?&nbsp; Dear me!</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in
all respects like gold that had stood the fire.&nbsp; First, the
perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged to the eighteen
denominations?&nbsp; Because, whoever did, the labouring people
did not.&nbsp; It was very strange to walk through the streets on
a Sunday morning, and note how few of <i>them</i> the barbarous
jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad,
called away from their own quarter, from their own close rooms,
from the corners of their own streets, where they lounged
listlessly, gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a
thing with which they had no manner of concern.&nbsp; Nor was it
merely the stranger who noticed this, because there was a native
organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be heard
of in the House of Commons every session, indignantly petitioning
for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by
main force.&nbsp; Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained
that these same people <i>would</i> get drunk, and showed in
tabular statements that they did get drunk, and proved at tea
parties that no inducement, human or Divine (except a medal),
would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk.&nbsp;
Then came the chemist and druggist, with other tabular
statements, showing that when they didn&rsquo;t get drunk, they
took opium.&nbsp; Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail,
with more tabular statements, outdoing all the previous tabular
statements, and showing that the same people <i>would</i> resort
to low haunts, hidden from the public eye, where they heard low
singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined in it; and where
A. B., aged twenty-four next birthday, and committed for eighteen
months&rsquo; solitary, had himself said (not that he had ever
shown himself particularly worthy of belief) his ruin began, as
he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have
been a tip-top moral specimen.&nbsp; Then came Mr. Gradgrind and
Mr. Bounderby, the two gentlemen at this present moment walking
through Coketown, and both eminently practical, who could, on
occasion, furnish more tabular statements derived from their own
personal experience, and illustrated by cases they had known and
seen, from which it clearly appeared&mdash;in short, it was the
only clear thing in the case&mdash;that these same people were a
bad lot altogether, gentlemen; that do what you would for them
they were never thankful for it, gentlemen; that they were
restless, gentlemen; that they never knew what they wanted; that
they lived upon the best, and bought fresh butter; and insisted
on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but prime parts of meat, and
yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable.&nbsp; In short,
it was the moral of the old nursery fable:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was an old woman, and what do you think?<br
/>
She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;<br />
Victuals and drink were the whole of her diet,<br />
And yet this old woman would <span class="GutSmall">NEVER</span>
be quiet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy between
the case of the Coketown population and the case of the little
Gradgrinds?&nbsp; Surely, none of us in our sober senses and
acquainted with figures, are to be told at this time of day, that
one of the foremost elements in the existence of the Coketown
working-people had been for scores of years, deliberately set at
nought?&nbsp; That there was any Fancy in them demanding to be
brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in
convulsions?&nbsp; That exactly in the ratio as they worked long
and monotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical
relief&mdash;some relaxation, encouraging good humour and good
spirits, and giving them a vent&mdash;some recognized holiday,
though it were but for an honest dance to a stirring band of
music&mdash;some occasional light pie in which even
M&rsquo;Choakumchild had no finger&mdash;which craving must and
would be satisfied aright, or must and would inevitably go wrong,
until the laws of the Creation were repealed?</p>
<p>&lsquo;This man lives at Pod&rsquo;s End, and I don&rsquo;t
quite know Pod&rsquo;s End,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Which is it, Bounderby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no
more respecting it.&nbsp; So they stopped for a moment, looking
about.</p>
<p>Almost as they did so, there came running round the corner of
the street at a quick pace and with a frightened look, a girl
whom Mr. Gradgrind recognized.&nbsp; &lsquo;Halloa!&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop!&nbsp; Where are you going!
Stop!&rsquo;&nbsp; Girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating,
and made him a curtsey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are you tearing about the streets,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind, &lsquo;in this improper manner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was&mdash;I was run after, sir,&rsquo; the girl
panted, &lsquo;and I wanted to get away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Run after?&rsquo; repeated Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who would run after <i>you</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her,
by the colourless boy, Bitzer, who came round the corner with
such blind speed and so little anticipating a stoppage on the
pavement, that he brought himself up against Mr.
Gradgrind&rsquo;s waistcoat and rebounded into the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, boy?&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What are you doing?&nbsp; How dare you dash
against&mdash;everybody&mdash;in this manner?&rsquo;&nbsp; Bitzer
picked up his cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and
backing, and knuckling his forehead, pleaded that it was an
accident.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was this boy running after you, Jupe?&rsquo; asked Mr.
Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said the girl reluctantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t, sir!&rsquo; cried Bitzer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not till she run away from me.&nbsp; But the horse-riders
never mind what they say, sir; they&rsquo;re famous for it.&nbsp;
You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they
say,&rsquo; addressing Sissy.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as well
known in the town as&mdash;please, sir, as the multiplication
table isn&rsquo;t known to the horse-riders.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bitzer
tried Mr. Bounderby with this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He frightened me so,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;with
his cruel faces!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Bitzer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp;
An&rsquo;t you one of the rest!&nbsp; An&rsquo;t you a
horse-rider!&nbsp; I never looked at her, sir.&nbsp; I asked her
if she would know how to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to
tell her again, and she ran away, and I ran after her, sir, that
she might know how to answer when she was asked.&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of saying such mischief if you
hadn&rsquo;t been a horse-rider?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her calling seems to be pretty well known among
&rsquo;em,&rsquo; observed Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;d have had the whole school peeping in a row, in
a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly, I think so,&rsquo; returned his friend.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bitzer, turn you about and take yourself home. Jupe, stay
here a moment.&nbsp; Let me hear of your running in this manner
any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the master of the
school.&nbsp; You understand what I mean.&nbsp; Go
along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead
again, glanced at Sissy, turned about, and retreated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, girl,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;take this
gentleman and me to your father&rsquo;s; we are going
there.&nbsp; What have you got in that bottle you are
carrying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gin,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, no, sir!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the nine
oils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The what?&rsquo; cried Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The nine oils, sir, to rub father with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, with a loud short
laugh, &lsquo;what the devil do you rub your father with nine
oils for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s what our people aways use, sir, when they
get any hurts in the ring,&rsquo; replied the girl, looking over
her shoulder, to assure herself that her pursuer was gone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They bruise themselves very bad sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Serve &rsquo;em right,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;for being idle.&rsquo;&nbsp; She glanced up at his face,
with mingled astonishment and dread.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By George!&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;when I was
four or five years younger than you, I had worse bruises upon me
than ten oils, twenty oils, forty oils, would have rubbed
off.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em by posture-making, but by
being banged about.&nbsp; There was no rope-dancing for me; I
danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the
rope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a
man as Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; His character was not unkind, all
things considered; it might have been a very kind one indeed, if
he had only made some round mistake in the arithmetic that
balanced it, years ago.&nbsp; He said, in what he meant for a
reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, &lsquo;And
this is Pod&rsquo;s End; is it, Jupe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is it, sir, and&mdash;if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind,
sir&mdash;this is the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little
public-house, with dim red lights in it.&nbsp; As haggard and as
shabby, as if, for want of custom, it had itself taken to
drinking, and had gone the way all drunkards go, and was very
near the end of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s only crossing the bar, sir, and up the
stairs, if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind, and waiting there for a
moment till I get a candle.&nbsp; If you should hear a dog, sir,
it&rsquo;s only Merrylegs, and he only barks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merrylegs and nine oils, eh!&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
entering last with his metallic laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretty well
this, for a self-made man!&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SLEARY&rsquo;S HORSEMANSHIP</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of the public-house was
the Pegasus&rsquo;s Arms.&nbsp; The Pegasus&rsquo;s legs might
have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse
upon the sign-board, the Pegasus&rsquo;s Arms was inscribed in
Roman letters.&nbsp; Beneath that inscription again, in a flowing
scroll, the painter had touched off the lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good malt makes good beer,<br />
Walk in, and they&rsquo;ll draw it here;<br />
Good wine makes good brandy,<br />
Give us a call, and you&rsquo;ll find it handy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar,
was another Pegasus&mdash;a theatrical one&mdash;with real gauze
let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all over him, and his
ethereal harness made of red silk.</p>
<p>As it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it
had not grown light enough within to see the picture, Mr.
Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no offence from these
idealities.&nbsp; They followed the girl up some steep
corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in the dark
while she went on for a candle.&nbsp; They expected every moment
to hear Merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing
dog had not barked when the girl and the candle appeared
together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father is not in our room, sir,&rsquo; she said, with a
face of great surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
walking in, I&rsquo;ll find him directly.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for them, sped away
with a quick light step.&nbsp; It was a mean, shabbily furnished
room, with a bed in it.&nbsp; The white night-cap, embellished
with two peacock&rsquo;s feathers and a pigtail bolt upright, in
which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon enlivened the varied
performances with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts, hung
upon a nail; but no other portion of his wardrobe, or other token
of himself or his pursuits, was to be seen anywhere.&nbsp; As to
Merrylegs, that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal
who went aboard the ark, might have been accidentally shut out of
it, for any sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the
Pegasus&rsquo;s Arms.</p>
<p>They heard the doors of rooms above, opening and shutting as
Sissy went from one to another in quest of her father; and
presently they heard voices expressing surprise.&nbsp; She came
bounding down again in a great hurry, opened a battered and mangy
old hair trunk, found it empty, and looked round with her hands
clasped and her face full of terror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father must have gone down to the Booth, sir.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know why he should go there, but he must be there;
I&rsquo;ll bring him in a minute!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was gone
directly, without her bonnet; with her long, dark, childish hair
streaming behind her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does she mean!&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Back in a minute?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more than a mile
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the
door, and introducing himself with the words, &lsquo;By your
leaves, gentlemen!&rsquo; walked in with his hands in his
pockets.&nbsp; His face, close-shaven, thin, and sallow, was
shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed into a roll all
round his head, and parted up the centre.&nbsp; His legs were
very robust, but shorter than legs of good proportions should
have been.&nbsp; His chest and back were as much too broad, as
his legs were too short.&nbsp; He was dressed in a Newmarket coat
and tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl round his neck; smelt of
lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses&rsquo; provender, and
sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded
of the stable and the play-house.&nbsp; Where the one began, and
the other ended, nobody could have told with any precision.&nbsp;
This gentleman was mentioned in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W.
B. Childers, so justly celebrated for his daring vaulting act as
the Wild Huntsman of the North American Prairies; in which
popular performance, a diminutive boy with an old face, who now
accompanied him, assisted as his infant son: being carried upside
down over his father&rsquo;s shoulder, by one foot, and held by
the crown of his head, heels upwards, in the palm of his
father&rsquo;s hand, according to the violent paternal manner in
which wild huntsmen may be observed to fondle their
offspring.&nbsp; Made up with curls, wreaths, wings, white
bismuth, and carmine, this hopeful young person soared into so
pleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the
maternal part of the spectators; but in private, where his
characteristics were a precocious cutaway coat and an extremely
gruff voice, he became of the Turf, turfy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By your leaves, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. E. W. B.
Childers, glancing round the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was you, I
believe, that were wishing to see Jupe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;His
daughter has gone to fetch him, but I can&rsquo;t wait;
therefore, if you please, I will leave a message for him with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, my friend,&rsquo; Mr. Bounderby put in,
&lsquo;we are the kind of people who know the value of time, and
you are the kind of people who don&rsquo;t know the value of
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not,&rsquo; retorted Mr. Childers, after
surveying him from head to foot, &lsquo;the honour of knowing
<i>you</i>,&mdash;but if you mean that you can make more money of
your time than I can of mine, I should judge from your
appearance, that you are about right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when you have made it, you can keep it too, I
should think,&rsquo; said Cupid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kidderminster, stow that!&rsquo; said Mr.
Childers.&nbsp; (Master Kidderminster was Cupid&rsquo;s mortal
name.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he come here cheeking us for, then?&rsquo;
cried Master Kidderminster, showing a very irascible
temperament.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you want to cheek us, pay your ochre
at the doors and take it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kidderminster,&rsquo; said Mr. Childers, raising his
voice, &lsquo;stow that!&mdash;Sir,&rsquo; to Mr. Gradgrind,
&lsquo;I was addressing myself to you.&nbsp; You may or you may
not be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the
audience), that Jupe has missed his tip very often,
lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has&mdash;what has he missed?&rsquo; asked Mr.
Gradgrind, glancing at the potent Bounderby for assistance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Missed his tip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never
done &rsquo;em once,&rsquo; said Master Kidderminster.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was loose in his
ponging.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t do what he ought to do.&nbsp; Was short in
his leaps and bad in his tumbling,&rsquo; Mr. Childers
interpreted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;that is tip, is
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a general way that&rsquo;s missing his tip,&rsquo;
Mr. E. W. B. Childers answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners,
and Ponging, eh!&rsquo; ejaculated Bounderby, with his laugh of
laughs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Queer sort of company, too, for a man who
has raised himself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lower yourself, then,&rsquo; retorted Cupid.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh Lord! if you&rsquo;ve raised yourself so high as all
that comes to, let yourself down a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a very obtrusive lad!&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind, turning, and knitting his brows on him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if
we had known you were coming,&rsquo; retorted Master
Kidderminster, nothing abashed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity
you don&rsquo;t have a bespeak, being so particular.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re on the Tight-Jeff, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does this unmannerly boy mean,&rsquo; asked Mr.
Gradgrind, eyeing him in a sort of desperation, &lsquo;by
Tight-Jeff?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; Get out, get out!&rsquo; said Mr.
Childers, thrusting his young friend from the room, rather in the
prairie manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff, it
don&rsquo;t much signify: it&rsquo;s only tight-rope and
slack-rope.&nbsp; You were going to give me a message for
Jupe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; continued Mr. Childers, quickly, &lsquo;my
opinion is, he will never receive it.&nbsp; Do you know much of
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw the man in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I doubt if you ever <i>will</i> see him now.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s pretty plain to me, he&rsquo;s off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that he has deserted his
daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&nbsp; I mean,&rsquo; said Mr. Childers, with a nod,
&lsquo;that he has cut.&nbsp; He was goosed last night, he was
goosed the night before last, he was goosed to-day.&nbsp; He has
lately got in the way of being always goosed, and he can&rsquo;t
stand it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why has he been&mdash;so very much&mdash;Goosed?&rsquo;
asked Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the word out of himself, with great
solemnity and reluctance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used
up,&rsquo; said Childers.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has his points as a
Cackler still, but he can&rsquo;t get a living out of
<i>them</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Cackler!&rsquo; Bounderby repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here
we go again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,&rsquo;
said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, superciliously throwing the
interpretation over his shoulder, and accompanying it with a
shake of his long hair&mdash;which all shook at once.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, it&rsquo;s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that
man deeper, to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed,
than to go through with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; interrupted Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is good, Gradgrind!&nbsp; A man so fond of his
daughter, that he runs away from her!&nbsp; This is devilish
good!&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, young
man.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t always occupied my present station of
life.&nbsp; I know what these things are.&nbsp; You may be
astonished to hear it, but my mother&mdash;ran away from
<i>me</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all
astonished to hear it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was
born in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me.&nbsp; Do I
excuse her for it?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Have I ever excused her for
it?&nbsp; Not I.&nbsp; What do I call her for it?&nbsp; I call
her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world,
except my drunken grandmother.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no family
pride about me, there&rsquo;s no imaginative sentimental humbug
about me.&nbsp; I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of
Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour,
what I should call her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones
of Wapping.&nbsp; So, with this man.&nbsp; He is a runaway rogue
and a vagabond, that&rsquo;s what he is, in English.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me what he is or what he is
not, whether in English or whether in French,&rsquo; retorted Mr.
E. W. B. Childers, facing about.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am telling your
friend what&rsquo;s the fact; if you don&rsquo;t like to hear it,
you can avail yourself of the open air.&nbsp; You give it mouth
enough, you do; but give it mouth in your own building at
least,&rsquo; remonstrated E. W. B. with stern irony.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give it mouth in this building, till
you&rsquo;re called upon.&nbsp; You have got some building of
your own I dare say, now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps so,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bounderby, rattling his
money and laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if
you please?&rsquo; said Childers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because this
isn&rsquo;t a strong building, and too much of you might bring it
down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again, he turned from
him, as from a man finally disposed of, to Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour
ago, and then was seen to slip out himself, with his hat over his
eyes, and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm.&nbsp;
She will never believe it of him, but he has cut away and left
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;why will she
never believe it of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because those two were one.&nbsp; Because they were
never asunder.&nbsp; Because, up to this time, he seemed to dote
upon her,&rsquo; said Childers, taking a step or two to look into
the empty trunk.&nbsp; Both Mr. Childers and Master Kidderminster
walked in a curious manner; with their legs wider apart than the
general run of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being
stiff in the knees.&nbsp; This walk was common to all the male
members of Sleary&rsquo;s company, and was understood to express,
that they were always on horseback.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Sissy!&nbsp; He had better have apprenticed
her,&rsquo; said Childers, giving his hair another shake, as he
looked up from the empty box.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, he leaves her
without anything to take to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is creditable to you, who have never been
apprenticed, to express that opinion,&rsquo; returned Mr.
Gradgrind, approvingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> never apprenticed?&nbsp; I was apprenticed
when I was seven year old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Indeed?&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, rather
resentfully, as having been defrauded of his good opinion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice
young persons to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Idleness,&rsquo; Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud
laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, by the Lord Harry!&nbsp; Nor
I!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her father always had it in his head,&rsquo; resumed
Childers, feigning unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s
existence, &lsquo;that she was to be taught the deuce-and-all of
education.&nbsp; How it got into his head, I can&rsquo;t say; I
can only say that it never got out.&nbsp; He has been picking up
a bit of reading for her, here&mdash;and a bit of writing for
her, there&mdash;and a bit of ciphering for her, somewhere
else&mdash;these seven years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his
pockets, stroked his face and chin, and looked, with a good deal
of doubt and a little hope, at Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; From the
first he had sought to conciliate that gentleman, for the sake of
the deserted girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Sissy got into the school here,&rsquo; he pursued,
&lsquo;her father was as pleased as Punch.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
altogether make out why, myself, as we were not stationary here,
being but comers and goers anywhere.&nbsp; I suppose, however, he
had this move in his mind&mdash;he was always
half-cracked&mdash;and then considered her provided for.&nbsp; If
you should happen to have looked in to-night, for the purpose of
telling him that you were going to do her any little
service,&rsquo; said Mr. Childers, stroking his face again, and
repeating his look, &lsquo;it would be very fortunate and
well-timed; very fortunate and well-timed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary,&rsquo; returned Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I came to tell him that her connections made her not an
object for the school, and that she must not attend any
more.&nbsp; Still, if her father really has left her, without any
connivance on her part&mdash;Bounderby, let me have a word with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his
equestrian walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood
stroking his face, and softly whistling.&nbsp; While thus
engaged, he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s voice
as &lsquo;No.&nbsp; <i>I</i> say no.&nbsp; I advise you
not.&nbsp; I say by no means.&rsquo;&nbsp; While, from Mr.
Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone the words, &lsquo;But
even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which has been
the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.&nbsp;
Think of it, Bounderby, in that point of view.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the various members of Sleary&rsquo;s company
gradually gathered together from the upper regions, where they
were quartered, and, from standing about, talking in low voices
to one another and to Mr. Childers, gradually insinuated
themselves and him into the room.&nbsp; There were two or three
handsome young women among them, with their two or three
husbands, and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine
little children, who did the fairy business when required.&nbsp;
The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing
the father of another of the families on the top of a great pole;
the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those
fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the apex, and himself for
the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks, stand
upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins, ride
upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.&nbsp;
All the mothers could (and did) dance, upon the slack wire and
the tight-rope, and perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds;
none of them were at all particular in respect of showing their
legs; and one of them, alone in a Greek chariot, drove six in
hand into every town they came to.&nbsp; They all assumed to be
mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their
private dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic
arrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company
would have produced but a poor letter on any subject.&nbsp; Yet
there was a remarkable gentleness and childishness about these
people, a special inaptitude for any kind of sharp practice, and
an untiring readiness to help and pity one another, deserving
often of as much respect, and always of as much generous
construction, as the every-day virtues of any class of people in
the world.</p>
<p>Last of all appeared Mr. Sleary: a stout man as already
mentioned, with one fixed eye, and one loose eye, a voice (if it
can be called so) like the efforts of a broken old pair of
bellows, a flabby surface, and a muddled head which was never
sober and never drunk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thquire!&rsquo; said Mr. Sleary, who was troubled with
asthma, and whose breath came far too thick and heavy for the
letter s, &lsquo;Your thervant!&nbsp; Thith ith a bad piethe of
bithnith, thith ith.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve heard of my Clown and
hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He addressed Mr. Gradgrind, who answered
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Thquire,&rsquo; he returned, taking off his hat,
and rubbing the lining with his pocket-handkerchief, which he
kept inside for the purpose.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ith it your intenthion
to do anything for the poor girl, Thquire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall have something to propose to her when she comes
back,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glad to hear it, Thquire.&nbsp; Not that I want to get
rid of the child, any more than I want to thtand in her
way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willing to take her prentith, though at her
age ith late.&nbsp; My voithe ith a little huthky, Thquire, and
not eathy heard by them ath don&rsquo;t know me; but if
you&rsquo;d been chilled and heated, heated and chilled, chilled
and heated in the ring when you wath young, ath often ath I have
been, <i>your</i> voithe wouldn&rsquo;t have lathted out,
Thquire, no more than mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say not,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What thall it be, Thquire, while you wait?&nbsp; Thall
it be Therry?&nbsp; Give it a name, Thquire!&rsquo; said Mr.
Sleary, with hospitable ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing for me, I thank you,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t thay nothing, Thquire.&nbsp; What doth your
friend thay?&nbsp; If you haven&rsquo;t took your feed yet, have
a glath of bitterth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here his daughter Josephine&mdash;a pretty fair-haired girl of
eighteen, who had been tied on a horse at two years old, and had
made a will at twelve, which she always carried about with her,
expressive of her dying desire to be drawn to the grave by the
two piebald ponies&mdash;cried, &lsquo;Father, hush! she has come
back!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then came Sissy Jupe, running into the room as
she had run out of it.&nbsp; And when she saw them all assembled,
and saw their looks, and saw no father there, she broke into a
most deplorable cry, and took refuge on the bosom of the most
accomplished tight-rope lady (herself in the family-way), who
knelt down on the floor to nurse her, and to weep over her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ith an internal thame, upon my thoul it ith,&rsquo;
said Sleary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O my dear father, my good kind father, where are you
gone?&nbsp; You are gone to try to do me some good, I know!&nbsp;
You are gone away for my sake, I am sure!&nbsp; And how miserable
and helpless you will be without me, poor, poor father, until you
come back!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was so pathetic to hear her saying
many things of this kind, with her face turned upward, and her
arms stretched out as if she were trying to stop his departing
shadow and embrace it, that no one spoke a word until Mr.
Bounderby (growing impatient) took the case in hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, good people all,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this is
wanton waste of time.&nbsp; Let the girl understand the
fact.&nbsp; Let her take it from me, if you like, who have been
run away from, myself.&nbsp; Here, what&rsquo;s your name!&nbsp;
Your father has absconded&mdash;deserted you&mdash;and you
mustn&rsquo;t expect to see him again as long as you
live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They cared so little for plain Fact, these people, and were in
that advanced state of degeneracy on the subject, that instead of
being impressed by the speaker&rsquo;s strong common sense, they
took it in extraordinary dudgeon.&nbsp; The men muttered
&lsquo;Shame!&rsquo; and the women &lsquo;Brute!&rsquo; and
Sleary, in some haste, communicated the following hint, apart to
Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you what, Thquire.&nbsp; To thpeak plain to you,
my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort, and drop
it.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re a very good natur&rsquo;d people, my
people, but they&rsquo;re accuthtomed to be quick in their
movementh; and if you don&rsquo;t act upon my advithe, I&rsquo;m
damned if I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll pith you out
o&rsquo; winder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, Mr.
Gradgrind found an opening for his eminently practical exposition
of the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of no moment,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;whether this
person is to be expected back at any time, or the contrary.&nbsp;
He is gone away, and there is no present expectation of his
return.&nbsp; That, I believe, is agreed on all hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thath agreed, Thquire.&nbsp; Thick to
that!&rsquo;&nbsp; From Sleary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then.&nbsp; I, who came here to inform the father
of the poor girl, Jupe, that she could not be received at the
school any more, in consequence of there being practical
objections, into which I need not enter, to the reception there
of the children of persons so employed, am prepared in these
altered circumstances to make a proposal.&nbsp; I am willing to
take charge of you, Jupe, and to educate you, and provide for
you.&nbsp; The only condition (over and above your good
behaviour) I make is, that you decide now, at once, whether to
accompany me or remain here.&nbsp; Also, that if you accompany me
now, it is understood that you communicate no more with any of
your friends who are here present.&nbsp; These observations
comprise the whole of the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the thame time,&rsquo; said Sleary, &lsquo;I mutht
put in my word, Thquire, tho that both thides of the banner may
be equally theen.&nbsp; If you like, Thethilia, to be prentitht,
you know the natur of the work and you know your
companionth.&nbsp; Emma Gordon, in whothe lap you&rsquo;re a
lying at prethent, would be a mother to you, and Joth&rsquo;phine
would be a thithter to you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t pretend to be of
the angel breed myself, and I don&rsquo;t thay but what, when you
mith&rsquo;d your tip, you&rsquo;d find me cut up rough, and
thwear an oath or two at you.&nbsp; But what I thay, Thquire,
ith, that good tempered or bad tempered, I never did a horthe a
injury yet, no more than thwearing at him went, and that I
don&rsquo;t expect I thall begin otherwithe at my time of life,
with a rider.&nbsp; I never wath much of a Cackler, Thquire, and
I have thed my thay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind,
who received it with a grave inclination of his head, and then
remarked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only observation I will make to you, Jupe, in the
way of influencing your decision, is, that it is highly desirable
to have a sound practical education, and that even your father
himself (from what I understand) appears, on your behalf, to have
known and felt that much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The last words had a visible effect upon her.&nbsp; She
stopped in her wild crying, a little detached herself from Emma
Gordon, and turned her face full upon her patron.&nbsp; The whole
company perceived the force of the change, and drew a long breath
together, that plainly said, &lsquo;she will go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be sure you know your own mind, Jupe,&rsquo; Mr.
Gradgrind cautioned her; &lsquo;I say no more.&nbsp; Be sure you
know your own mind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When father comes back,&rsquo; cried the girl, bursting
into tears again after a minute&rsquo;s silence, &lsquo;how will
he ever find me if I go away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be quite at ease,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
calmly; he worked out the whole matter like a sum: &lsquo;you may
be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score.&nbsp; In such a case, your
father, I apprehend, must find out Mr.&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thleary.&nbsp; Thath my name, Thquire.&nbsp; Not
athamed of it.&nbsp; Known all over England, and alwayth paythe
ith way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must find out Mr. Sleary, who would then let him know
where you went.&nbsp; I should have no power of keeping you
against his wish, and he would have no difficulty, at any time,
in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown.&nbsp; I am well
known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well known,&rsquo; assented Mr. Sleary, rolling his
loose eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re one of the thort, Thquire,
that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe.&nbsp;
But never mind that at prethent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing
with her hands before her face, &lsquo;Oh, give me my clothes,
give me my clothes, and let me go away before I break my
heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes
together&mdash;it was soon done, for they were not many&mdash;and
to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with
them.&nbsp; Sissy sat all the time upon the ground, still
sobbing, and covering her eyes.&nbsp; Mr. Gradgrind and his
friend Bounderby stood near the door, ready to take her
away.&nbsp; Mr. Sleary stood in the middle of the room, with the
male members of the company about him, exactly as he would have
stood in the centre of the ring during his daughter
Josephine&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; He wanted nothing but his
whip.</p>
<p>The basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her,
and smoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.&nbsp; Then they
pressed about her, and bent over her in very natural attitudes,
kissing and embracing her: and brought the children to take leave
of her; and were a tender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women
altogether.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Jupe,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you are quite determined, come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the
company yet, and every one of them had to unfold his arms (for
they all assumed the professional attitude when they found
themselves near Sleary), and give her a parting kiss&mdash;Master
Kidderminster excepted, in whose young nature there was an
original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to have
harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.&nbsp; Mr.
Sleary was reserved until the last.&nbsp; Opening his arms wide
he took her by both her hands, and would have sprung her up and
down, after the riding-master manner of congratulating young
ladies on their dismounting from a rapid act; but there was no
rebound in Sissy, and she only stood before him crying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, my dear!&rsquo; said Sleary.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make your fortun, I hope, and none of our
poor folkth will ever trouble you, I&rsquo;ll pound it.&nbsp; I
with your father hadn&rsquo;t taken hith dog with him; ith a
ill-conwenienth to have the dog out of the billth.&nbsp; But on
thecond thoughth, he wouldn&rsquo;t have performed without hith
mathter, tho ith ath broad ath ith long!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye,
surveyed his company with his loose one, kissed her, shook his
head, and handed her to Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There the ith, Thquire,&rsquo; he said, sweeping her
with a professional glance as if she were being adjusted in her
seat, &lsquo;and the&rsquo;ll do you juthtithe.&nbsp; Good-bye,
Thethilia!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Cecilia!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-bye,
Sissy!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;God bless you, dear!&rsquo;&nbsp; In a
variety of voices from all the room.</p>
<p>But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine
oils in her bosom, and he now interposed with &lsquo;Leave the
bottle, my dear; ith large to carry; it will be of no uthe to you
now.&nbsp; Give it to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; she said, in another burst of
tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; Pray let me keep it for father
till he comes back!&nbsp; He will want it when he comes
back.&nbsp; He had never thought of going away, when he sent me
for it.&nbsp; I must keep it for him, if you please!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tho be it, my dear.&nbsp; (You thee how it ith,
Thquire!)&nbsp; Farewell, Thethilia!&nbsp; My latht wordth to you
ith thith, Thtick to the termth of your engagement, be obedient
to the Thquire, and forget uth.&nbsp; But if, when you&rsquo;re
grown up and married and well off, you come upon any
horthe-riding ever, don&rsquo;t be hard upon it, don&rsquo;t be
croth with it, give it a Bethpeak if you can, and think you might
do wurth.&nbsp; People mutht be amuthed, Thquire,
thomehow,&rsquo; continued Sleary, rendered more pursy than ever,
by so much talking; &lsquo;they can&rsquo;t be alwayth a working,
nor yet they can&rsquo;t be alwayth a learning.&nbsp; Make the
betht of uth; not the wurtht.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my living out
of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I conthider that I
lay down the philothophy of the thubject when I thay to you,
Thquire, make the betht of uth: not the wurtht!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs
and the fixed eye of Philosophy&mdash;and its rolling eye,
too&mdash;soon lost the three figures and the basket in the
darkness of the street.</p>

33</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MRS. SPARSIT</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bounderby</span> being a bachelor, an
elderly lady presided over his establishment, in consideration of
a certain annual stipend.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit was this
lady&rsquo;s name; and she was a prominent figure in attendance
on Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s car, as it rolled along in triumph with
the Bully of humility inside.</p>
<p>For, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days, but was
highly connected.&nbsp; She had a great aunt living in these very
times called Lady Scadgers.&nbsp; Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom
she was the relict, had been by the mother&rsquo;s side what Mrs.
Sparsit still called &lsquo;a Powler.&rsquo;&nbsp; Strangers of
limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed
not to know what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain
whether it might be a business, or a political party, or a
profession of faith.&nbsp; The better class of minds, however,
did not need to be informed that the Powlers were an ancient
stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly far back that it
was not surprising if they sometimes lost themselves&mdash;which
they had rather frequently done, as respected horse-flesh,
blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the Insolvent
Debtors&rsquo; Court.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother&rsquo;s side a
Powler, married this lady, being by the father&rsquo;s side a
Scadgers.&nbsp; Lady Scadgers (an immensely fat old woman, with
an inordinate appetite for butcher&rsquo;s meat, and a mysterious
leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen years)
contrived the marriage, at a period when Sparsit was just of age,
and chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on
two long slim props, and surmounted by no head worth
mentioning.&nbsp; He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle, but
owed it all before he came into it, and spent it twice over
immediately afterwards.&nbsp; Thus, when he died, at twenty-four
(the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he did
not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after
the honeymoon, in affluent circumstances.&nbsp; That bereaved
lady, fifteen years older than he, fell presently at deadly feud
with her only relative, Lady Scadgers; and, partly to spite her
ladyship, and partly to maintain herself, went out at a
salary.&nbsp; And here she was now, in her elderly days, with the
Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had
captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s tea as he took
his breakfast.</p>
<p>If Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive
Princess whom he took about as a feature in his
state-processions, he could not have made a greater flourish with
her than he habitually did.&nbsp; Just as it belonged to his
boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so it belonged to
it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the measure that he
would not allow his own youth to have been attended by a single
favourable circumstance, he brightened Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s
juvenile career with every possible advantage, and showered
waggon-loads of early roses all over that lady&rsquo;s
path.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet, sir,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;how
does it turn out after all?&nbsp; Why here she is at a hundred a
year (I give her a hundred, which she is pleased to term
handsome), keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of
Coketown!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third
parties took it up, and handled it on some occasions with
considerable briskness.&nbsp; It was one of the most exasperating
attributes of Bounderby, that he not only sang his own praises
but stimulated other men to sing them.&nbsp; There was a moral
infection of clap-trap in him.&nbsp; Strangers, modest enough
elsewhere, started up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in
quite a rampant way, of Bounderby.&nbsp; They made him out to be
the Royal arms, the Union-Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull, Habeas
Corpus, the Bill of Rights, An Englishman&rsquo;s house is his
castle, Church and State, and God save the Queen, all put
together.&nbsp; And as often (and it was very often) as an orator
of this kind brought into his peroration,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Princes and lords may flourish or may
fade,<br />
A breath can make them, as a breath has made,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;it was, for certain, more or less understood among the
company that he had heard of Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;you are
unusually slow, sir, with your breakfast this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;I am
thinking about Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s whim;&rsquo; Tom Gradgrind,
for a bluff independent manner of speaking&mdash;as if somebody
were always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to say
Thomas, and he wouldn&rsquo;t; &lsquo;Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s whim,
ma&rsquo;am, of bringing up the tumbling-girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The girl is now waiting to know,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, &lsquo;whether she is to go straight to the school, or
up to the Lodge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must wait, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; answered Bounderby,
&lsquo;till I know myself.&nbsp; We shall have Tom Gradgrind down
here presently, I suppose.&nbsp; If he should wish her to remain
here a day or two longer, of course she can,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course she can if you wish it, Mr.
Bounderby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told him I would give her a shake-down here, last
night, in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to
let her have any association with Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Mr. Bounderby?&nbsp; Very thoughtful of
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s Coriolanian nose underwent
a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her black eyebrows
contracted as she took a sip of tea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s tolerably clear to <i>me</i>,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, &lsquo;that the little puss can get small good out of
such companionship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind, Mr.
Bounderby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m speaking of
Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your observation being limited to &ldquo;little
puss,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;and there being two
little girls in question, I did not know which might be indicated
by that expression.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Louisa, Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite another father to Louisa,
sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit took a little more tea; and, as
she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup,
rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking the
infernal gods.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had said I was another father to Tom&mdash;young
Tom, I mean, not my friend Tom Gradgrind&mdash;you might have
been nearer the mark.&nbsp; I am going to take young Tom into my
office.&nbsp; Going to have him under my wing,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed?&nbsp; Rather young for that, is he not,
sir?&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s &lsquo;sir,&rsquo; in
addressing Mr. Bounderby, was a word of ceremony, rather exacting
consideration for herself in the use, than honouring him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take him at once; he is to
finish his educational cramming before then,&rsquo; said
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the Lord Harry, he&rsquo;ll have
enough of it, first and last!&nbsp; He&rsquo;d open his eyes,
that boy would, if he knew how empty of learning <i>my</i> young
maw was, at his time of life.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which, by the by, he
probably did know, for he had heard of it often enough.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s extraordinary the difficulty I have on
scores of such subjects, in speaking to any one on equal
terms.&nbsp; Here, for example, I have been speaking to you this
morning about tumblers.&nbsp; Why, what do <i>you</i> know about
tumblers?&nbsp; At the time when, to have been a tumbler in the
mud of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize in
the lottery to me, you were at the Italian Opera.&nbsp; You were
coming out of the Italian Opera, ma&rsquo;am, in white satin and
jewels, a blaze of splendour, when I hadn&rsquo;t a penny to buy
a link to light you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I certainly, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a
dignity serenely mournful, &lsquo;was familiar with the Italian
Opera at a very early age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Egad, ma&rsquo;am, so was I,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;&mdash;with the wrong side of it.&nbsp; A hard bed the
pavement of its Arcade used to make, I assure you.&nbsp; People
like you, ma&rsquo;am, accustomed from infancy to lie on Down
feathers, have no idea <i>how</i> hard a paving-stone is, without
trying it.&nbsp; No, no, it&rsquo;s of no use my talking to
<i>you</i> about tumblers.&nbsp; I should speak of foreign
dancers, and the West End of London, and May Fair, and lords and
ladies and honourables.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, with decent
resignation, &lsquo;it is not necessary that you should do
anything of that kind.&nbsp; I hope I have learnt how to
accommodate myself to the changes of life.&nbsp; If I have
acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences,
and can scarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit for that,
since I believe it is a general sentiment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said her patron,
&lsquo;perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do
like to hear, in his own unpolished way, what Josiah Bounderby,
of Coketown, has gone through.&nbsp; But you must confess that
you were born in the lap of luxury, yourself.&nbsp; Come,
ma&rsquo;am, you know you were born in the lap of
luxury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit with a
shake of her head, &lsquo;deny it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table, and stand with
his back to the fire, looking at her; she was such an enhancement
of his position.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you were in crack society.&nbsp; Devilish high
society,&rsquo; he said, warming his legs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an
affectation of humility the very opposite of his, and therefore
in no danger of jostling it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of
it,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of
social widowhood upon her.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is unquestionably
true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally
embraced his legs in his great satisfaction and laughed
aloud.&nbsp; Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced, he
received the former with a shake of the hand, and the latter with
a kiss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?&rsquo; asked Mr.
Gradgrind.</p>
<p>Certainly.&nbsp; So Jupe was sent there.&nbsp; On coming in,
she curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby, and to his friend Tom Gradgrind,
and also to Louisa; but in her confusion unluckily omitted Mrs.
Sparsit.&nbsp; Observing this, the blustrous Bounderby had the
following remarks to make:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I tell you what, my girl.&nbsp; The name of that
lady by the teapot, is Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; That lady acts as
mistress of this house, and she is a highly connected lady.&nbsp;
Consequently, if ever you come again into any room in this house,
you will make a short stay in it if you don&rsquo;t behave
towards that lady in your most respectful manner.&nbsp; Now, I
don&rsquo;t care a button what you do to <i>me</i>, because I
don&rsquo;t affect to be anybody.&nbsp; So far from having high
connections I have no connections at all, and I come of the scum
of the earth.&nbsp; But towards that lady, I do care what you do;
and you shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall
not come here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope, Bounderby,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, in a
conciliatory voice, &lsquo;that this was merely an
oversight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests, Mrs. Sparsit,&rsquo;
said Bounderby, &lsquo;that this was merely an oversight.&nbsp;
Very likely.&nbsp; However, as you are aware, ma&rsquo;am, I
don&rsquo;t allow of even oversights towards you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very good indeed, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs.
Sparsit, shaking her head with her State humility.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is not worth speaking of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself
with tears in her eyes, was now waved over by the master of the
house to Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; She stood looking intently at him,
and Louisa stood coldly by, with her eyes upon the ground, while
he proceeded thus:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house;
and, when you are not in attendance at the school, to employ you
about Mrs. Gradgrind, who is rather an invalid.&nbsp; I have
explained to Miss Louisa&mdash;this is Miss Louisa&mdash;the
miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to
expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and
is not to be referred to any more.&nbsp; From this time you begin
your history.&nbsp; You are, at present, ignorant, I
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&lsquo;Yes, sir, very,&rsquo; she answered,
curtseying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be
strictly educated; and you will be a living proof to all who come
into communication with you, of the advantages of the training
you will receive.&nbsp; You will be reclaimed and formed.&nbsp;
You have been in the habit now of reading to your father, and
those people I found you among, I dare say?&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind, beckoning her nearer to him before he said so, and
dropping his voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to father and Merrylegs, sir.&nbsp; At least I
mean to father, when Merrylegs was always there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
with a passing frown.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t ask about
him.&nbsp; I understand you to have been in the habit of reading
to your father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, yes, sir, thousands of times.&nbsp; They were the
happiest&mdash;O, of all the happy times we had together,
sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was only now when her sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked
at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what,&rsquo; asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower
voice, &lsquo;did you read to your father, Jupe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the
Hunchback, and the Genies,&rsquo; she sobbed out; &lsquo;and
about&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;that is
enough.&nbsp; Never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense
any more.&nbsp; Bounderby, this is a case for rigid training, and
I shall observe it with interest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;I have
given you my opinion already, and I shouldn&rsquo;t do as you
do.&nbsp; But, very well, very well.&nbsp; Since you are bent
upon it, <i>very</i> well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with
them to Stone Lodge, and on the way Louisa never spoke one word,
good or bad.&nbsp; And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily
pursuits.&nbsp; And Mrs. Sparsit got behind her eyebrows and
meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the evening.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NEVER WONDER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us strike the key-note again,
before pursuing the tune.</p>
<p>When she was half a dozen years younger, Louisa had been
overheard to begin a conversation with her brother one day, by
saying &lsquo;Tom, I wonder&rsquo;&mdash;upon which Mr.
Gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped forth into the
light and said, &lsquo;Louisa, never wonder!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of
educating the reason without stooping to the cultivation of the
sentiments and affections.&nbsp; Never wonder.&nbsp; By means of
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, settle
everything somehow, and never wonder.&nbsp; Bring to me, says
M&rsquo;Choakumchild, yonder baby just able to walk, and I will
engage that it shall never wonder.</p>
<p>Now, besides very many babies just able to walk, there
happened to be in Coketown a considerable population of babies
who had been walking against time towards the infinite world,
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years and more.&nbsp; These
portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any
human society, the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched
one another&rsquo;s faces and pulled one another&rsquo;s hair by
way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their
improvement&mdash;which they never did; a surprising
circumstance, when the happy adaptation of the means to the end
is considered.&nbsp; Still, although they differed in every other
particular, conceivable and inconceivable (especially
inconceivable), they were pretty well united on the point that
these unlucky infants were never to wonder.&nbsp; Body number
one, said they must take everything on trust.&nbsp; Body number
two, said they must take everything on political economy.&nbsp;
Body number three, wrote leaden little books for them, showing
how the good grown-up baby invariably got to the Savings-bank,
and the bad grown-up baby invariably got transported.&nbsp; Body
number four, under dreary pretences of being droll (when it was
very melancholy indeed), made the shallowest pretences of
concealing pitfalls of knowledge, into which it was the duty of
these babies to be smuggled and inveigled.&nbsp; But, all the
bodies agreed that they were never to wonder.</p>
<p>There was a library in Coketown, to which general access was
easy.&nbsp; Mr. Gradgrind greatly tormented his mind about what
the people read in this library: a point whereon little rivers of
tabular statements periodically flowed into the howling ocean of
tabular statements, which no diver ever got to any depth in and
came up sane.&nbsp; It was a disheartening circumstance, but a
melancholy fact, that even these readers persisted in
wondering.&nbsp; They wondered about human nature, human
passions, human hopes and fears, the struggles, triumphs and
defeats, the cares and joys and sorrows, the lives and deaths of
common men and women!&nbsp; They sometimes, after fifteen
hours&rsquo; work, sat down to read mere fables about men and
women, more or less like themselves, and about children, more or
less like their own.&nbsp; They took De Foe to their bosoms,
instead of Euclid, and seemed to be on the whole more comforted
by Goldsmith than by Cocker.&nbsp; Mr. Gradgrind was for ever
working, in print and out of print, at this eccentric sum, and he
never could make out how it yielded this unaccountable
product.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sick of my life, Loo.&nbsp; I, hate it altogether,
and I hate everybody except you,&rsquo; said the unnatural young
Thomas Gradgrind in the hair-cutting chamber at twilight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t hate Sissy, Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe.&nbsp; And she
hates me,&rsquo; said Tom, moodily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she does not, Tom, I am sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must,&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;She must just
hate and detest the whole set-out of us.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll
bother her head off, I think, before they have done with
her.&nbsp; Already she&rsquo;s getting as pale as wax, and as
heavy as&mdash;I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Young Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting astride of a
chair before the fire, with his arms on the back, and his sulky
face on his arms.&nbsp; His sister sat in the darker corner by
the fireside, now looking at him, now looking at the bright
sparks as they dropped upon the hearth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to me,&rsquo; said Tom, tumbling his hair all manner
of ways with his sulky hands, &lsquo;I am a Donkey, that&rsquo;s
what <i>I</i> am.&nbsp; I am as obstinate as one, I am more
stupid than one, I get as much pleasure as one, and I should like
to kick like one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not me, I hope, Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Loo; I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt <i>you</i>.&nbsp; I made
an exception of you at first.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
this&mdash;jolly old&mdash;Jaundiced Jail,&rsquo; Tom had paused
to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the
parental roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the
strong alliteration of this one, &lsquo;would be without
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Tom?&nbsp; Do you really and truly say
so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course I do.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of
talking about it!&rsquo; returned Tom, chafing his face on his
coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison
with his spirit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, Tom,&rsquo; said his sister, after silently
watching the sparks awhile, &lsquo;as I get older, and nearer
growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate
it is for me that I can&rsquo;t reconcile you to home better than
I am able to do.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what other girls
know.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t play to you, or sing to you.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t talk to you so as to lighten your mind, for I never
see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be
a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when you are
tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no more do I.&nbsp; I am as bad as you in that
respect; and I am a Mule too, which you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; If
father was determined to make me either a Prig or a Mule, and I
am not a Prig, why, it stands to reason, I must be a Mule.&nbsp;
And so I am,&rsquo; said Tom, desperately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity,&rsquo; said Louisa, after
another pause, and speaking thoughtfully out of her dark corner:
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s a great pity, Tom.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
unfortunate for both of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; You,&rsquo; said Tom; &lsquo;you are a girl,
Loo, and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t miss anything in you.&nbsp; You are the only pleasure
I have&mdash;you can brighten even this place&mdash;and you can
always lead me as you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a dear brother, Tom; and while you think I can
do such things, I don&rsquo;t so much mind knowing better.&nbsp;
Though I do know better, Tom, and am very sorry for
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She came and kissed him, and went back into her
corner again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much
about,&rsquo; said Tom, spitefully setting his teeth, &lsquo;and
all the Figures, and all the people who found them out: and I
wish I could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them, and
blow them all up together!&nbsp; However, when I go to live with
old Bounderby, I&rsquo;ll have my revenge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your revenge, Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean, I&rsquo;ll enjoy myself a little, and go about
and see something, and hear something.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
recompense myself for the way in which I have been brought
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t disappoint yourself beforehand,
Tom.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby thinks as father thinks, and is a great
deal rougher, and not half so kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Tom, laughing; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind that.&nbsp; I shall very well know how to manage and smooth
old Bounderby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their shadows were defined upon the wall, but those of the
high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall
and on the ceiling, as if the brother and sister were overhung by
a dark cavern.&nbsp; Or, a fanciful imagination&mdash;if such
treason could have been there&mdash;might have made it out to be
the shadow of their subject, and of its lowering association with
their future.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is your great mode of smoothing and managing,
Tom?&nbsp; Is it a secret?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;if it is a secret,
it&rsquo;s not far off.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you.&nbsp; You are his
little pet, you are his favourite; he&rsquo;ll do anything for
you.&nbsp; When he says to me what I don&rsquo;t like, I shall
say to him, &ldquo;My sister Loo will be hurt and disappointed,
Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; She always used to tell me she was sure you
would be easier with me than this.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll
bring him about, or nothing will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After waiting for some answering remark, and getting none, Tom
wearily relapsed into the present time, and twined himself
yawning round and about the rails of his chair, and rumpled his
head more and more, until he suddenly looked up, and asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you gone to sleep, Loo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Tom.&nbsp; I am looking at the fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I
could find,&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Another of the
advantages, I suppose, of being a girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom,&rsquo; enquired his sister, slowly, and in a
curious tone, as if she were reading what she asked in the fire,
and it was not quite plainly written there, &lsquo;do you look
forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s one thing to be said of it,&rsquo;
returned Tom, pushing his chair from him, and standing up;
&lsquo;it will be getting away from home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is one thing to be said of it,&rsquo; Louisa
repeated in her former curious tone; &lsquo;it will be getting
away from home.&nbsp; Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave
you, Loo, and to leave you here.&nbsp; But I must go, you know,
whether I like it or not; and I had better go where I can take
with me some advantage of your influence, than where I should
lose it altogether.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Tom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The answer was so long in coming, though there was no
indecision in it, that Tom went and leaned on the back of her
chair, to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her, from her
point of view, and see what he could make of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except that it is a fire,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;it
looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks.&nbsp;
What do you see in it?&nbsp; Not a circus?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything in it, Tom,
particularly.&nbsp; But since I have been looking at it, I have
been wondering about you and me, grown up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wondering again!&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have such unmanageable thoughts,&rsquo; returned his
sister, &lsquo;that they <i>will</i> wonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I beg of you, Louisa,&rsquo; said Mrs. Gradgrind,
who had opened the door without being heard, &lsquo;to do nothing
of that description, for goodness&rsquo; sake, you inconsiderate
girl, or I shall never hear the last of it from your
father.&nbsp; And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor
head continually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you
have been, and whose education has cost what yours has, should be
found encouraging his sister to wonder, when he knows his father
has expressly said that she is not to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa denied Tom&rsquo;s participation in the offence; but
her mother stopped her with the conclusive answer, &lsquo;Louisa,
don&rsquo;t tell me, in my state of health; for unless you had
been encouraged, it is morally and physically impossible that you
could have done it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at
the red sparks dropping out of the fire, and whitening and
dying.&nbsp; It made me think, after all, how short my life would
be, and how little I could hope to do in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost
energetic.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand there
and tell me such stuff, Louisa, to <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>my face, when you know very well that
if it was ever to reach your father&rsquo;s ears I should never
hear the last of it.&nbsp; After all the trouble that has been
taken with you!&nbsp; After the lectures you have attended, and
the experiments you have seen!&nbsp; After I have heard you
myself, when the whole of my right side has been benumbed, going
on with your master about combustion, and calcination, and
calorification, and I may say every kind of ation that could
drive a poor invalid distracted, to hear you talking in this
absurd way about sparks and ashes!&nbsp; I wish,&rsquo; whimpered
Mrs. Gradgrind, taking a chair, and discharging her strongest
point before succumbing under these mere shadows of facts,
&lsquo;yes, I really <i>do</i> wish that I had never had a
family, and then you would have known what it was to do without
me!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SISSY&rsquo;S PROGRESS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Sissy Jupe</span> had not an easy time of
it, between Mr. M&rsquo;Choakumchild and Mrs. Gradgrind, and was
not without strong impulses, in the first months of her
probation, to run away.&nbsp; It hailed facts all day long so
very hard, and life in general was opened to her as such a
closely ruled ciphering-book, that assuredly she would have run
away, but for only one restraint.</p>
<p>It is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the
result of no arithmetical process, was self-imposed in defiance
of all calculation, and went dead against any table of
probabilities that any Actuary would have drawn up from the
premises.&nbsp; The girl believed that her father had not
deserted her; she lived in the hope that he would come back, and
in the faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining
where she was.</p>
<p>The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this
consolation, rejecting the superior comfort of knowing, on a
sound arithmetical basis, that her father was an unnatural
vagabond, filled Mr. Gradgrind with pity.&nbsp; Yet, what was to
be done?&nbsp; M&rsquo;Choakumchild reported that she had a very
dense head for figures; that, once possessed with a general idea
of the globe, she took the smallest conceivable interest in its
exact measurements; that she was extremely slow in the
acquisition of dates, unless some pitiful incident happened to be
connected therewith; that she would burst into tears on being
required (by the mental process) immediately to name the cost of
two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps at fourteen-pence
halfpenny; that she was as low down, in the school, as low could
be; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of
Political Economy, she had only yesterday been set right by a
prattler three feet high, for returning to the question,
&lsquo;What is the first principle of this science?&rsquo; the
absurd answer, &lsquo;To do unto others as I would that they
should do unto me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind observed, shaking his head, that all this was
very bad; that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at
the mill of knowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book,
report, and tabular statements A to Z; and that Jupe &lsquo;must
be kept to it.&rsquo;&nbsp; So Jupe was kept to it, and became
low-spirited, but no wiser.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a fine thing to be you, Miss Louisa!&rsquo;
she said, one night, when Louisa had endeavoured to make her
perplexities for next day something clearer to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should know so much, Miss Louisa.&nbsp; All that is
difficult to me now, would be so easy then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might not be the better for it, Sissy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, &lsquo;I should
not be the worse, Miss Louisa.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which Miss Louisa
answered, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There had been so little communication between these
two&mdash;both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously
round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human
interference, and because of the prohibition relative to
Sissy&rsquo;s past career&mdash;that they were still almost
strangers.&nbsp; Sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed
to Louisa&rsquo;s face, was uncertain whether to say more or to
remain silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant
with her than I can ever be,&rsquo; Louisa resumed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are pleasanter to yourself, than <i>I</i> am to
<i>my</i>self.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, if you please, Miss Louisa,&rsquo; Sissy pleaded,
&lsquo;I am&mdash;O so stupid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would
be wiser by-and-by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Sissy, half crying,
&lsquo;what a stupid girl I am.&nbsp; All through school hours I
make mistakes.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. M&rsquo;Choakumchild call me
up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t help them.&nbsp; They seem to come natural to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. and Mrs. M&rsquo;Choakumchild never make any
mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&rsquo; she eagerly returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
know everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me some of your mistakes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am almost ashamed,&rsquo; said Sissy, with
reluctance.&nbsp; &lsquo;But to-day, for instance, Mr.
M&rsquo;Choakumchild was explaining to us about Natural
Prosperity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;National, I think it must have been,&rsquo; observed
Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it was.&mdash;But isn&rsquo;t it the same?&rsquo;
she timidly asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better say, National, as he said so,&rsquo;
returned Louisa, with her dry reserve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;National Prosperity.&nbsp; And he said, Now, this
schoolroom is a Nation.&nbsp; And in this nation, there are fifty
millions of money.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t this a prosperous
nation?&nbsp; Girl number twenty, isn&rsquo;t this a prosperous
nation, and a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you in a thriving state?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; asked Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Louisa, I said I didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I
thought I couldn&rsquo;t know whether it was a prosperous nation
or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or not, unless I
knew who had got the money, and whether any of it was mine.&nbsp;
But that had nothing to do with it.&nbsp; It was not in the
figures at all,&rsquo; said Sissy, wiping her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a great mistake of yours,&rsquo; observed
Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now.&nbsp; Then Mr.
M&rsquo;Choakumchild said he would try me again.&nbsp; And he
said, This schoolroom is an immense town, and in it there are a
million of inhabitants, and only five-and-twenty are starved to
death in the streets, in the course of a year.&nbsp; What is your
remark on that proportion?&nbsp; And my remark was&mdash;for I
couldn&rsquo;t think of a better one&mdash;that I thought it must
be just as hard upon those who were starved, whether the others
were a million, or a million million.&nbsp; And that was wrong,
too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Mr. M&rsquo;Choakumchild said he would try me once
more.&nbsp; And he said, Here are the
stutterings&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Statistics,&rsquo; said Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss Louisa&mdash;they always remind me of
stutterings, and that&rsquo;s another of my mistakes&mdash;of
accidents upon the sea.&nbsp; And I find (Mr.
M&rsquo;Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred
thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five
hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death.&nbsp; What is the
percentage?&nbsp; And I said, Miss;&rsquo; here Sissy fairly
sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest
error; &lsquo;I said it was nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, Sissy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, Miss&mdash;to the relations and friends of the
people who were killed.&nbsp; I shall never learn,&rsquo; said
Sissy.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the worst of all is, that although my
poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so
anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I
don&rsquo;t like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped
abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her
face.&nbsp; Then she asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did your father know so much himself, that he wished
you to be well taught too, Sissy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her
sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa
added, &lsquo;No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no
harm could be found in such an innocent question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Miss Louisa,&rsquo; answered Sissy, upon this
encouragement, shaking her head; &lsquo;father knows very little
indeed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as much as he can do to write; and
it&rsquo;s more than people in general can do to read his
writing.&nbsp; Though it&rsquo;s plain to <i>me</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father says she was quite a scholar.&nbsp; She died
when I was born.&nbsp; She was;&rsquo; Sissy made the terrible
communication nervously; &lsquo;she was a dancer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did your father love her?&rsquo;&nbsp; Louisa asked
these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar
to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and
hiding in solitary places.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes!&nbsp; As dearly as he loves me.&nbsp; Father
loved me, first, for her sake.&nbsp; He carried me about with him
when I was quite a baby.&nbsp; We have never been asunder from
that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only for my good.&nbsp; Nobody understands him as I do;
nobody knows him as I do.&nbsp; When he left me for my
good&mdash;he never would have left me for his own&mdash;I know
he was almost broken-hearted with the trial.&nbsp; He will not be
happy for a single minute, till he comes back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me more about him,&rsquo; said Louisa, &lsquo;I
will never ask you again.&nbsp; Where did you live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place
to live in. Father&rsquo;s a;&rsquo; Sissy whispered the awful
word, &lsquo;a clown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To make the people laugh?&rsquo; said Louisa, with a
nod of intelligence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; But they wouldn&rsquo;t laugh sometimes, and
then father cried.&nbsp; Lately, they very often wouldn&rsquo;t
laugh, and he used to come home despairing.&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s
not like most.&nbsp; Those who didn&rsquo;t know him as well as I
do, and didn&rsquo;t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he
was not quite right.&nbsp; Sometimes they played tricks upon him;
but they never knew how he felt them, and shrunk up, when he was
alone with me.&nbsp; He was far, far timider than they
thought!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you were his comfort through everything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, with the tears rolling down her face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I hope so, and father said I was.&nbsp; It was because he
grew so scared and trembling, and because he felt himself to be a
poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to be his words),
that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be different
from him.&nbsp; I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and
he was very fond of that.&nbsp; They were wrong books&mdash;I am
never to speak of them here&mdash;but we didn&rsquo;t know there
was any harm in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he liked them?&rsquo; said Louisa, with a searching
gaze on Sissy all this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O very much!&nbsp; They kept him, many times, from what
did him real harm.&nbsp; And often and often of a night, he used
to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would
let the lady go on with the story, or would have her head cut off
before it was finished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your father was always kind?&nbsp; To the
last?&rsquo; asked Louisa contravening the great principle, and
wondering very much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always, always!&rsquo; returned Sissy, clasping her
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kinder and kinder than I can tell.&nbsp; He
was angry only one night, and that was not to me, but
Merrylegs.&nbsp; Merrylegs;&rsquo; she whispered the awful fact;
&lsquo;is his performing dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why was he angry with the dog?&rsquo; Louisa
demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, soon after they came home from performing, told
Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand
across them&mdash;which is one of his tricks.&nbsp; He looked at
father, and didn&rsquo;t do it at once.&nbsp; Everything of
father&rsquo;s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn&rsquo;t
pleased the public at all.&nbsp; He cried out that the very dog
knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him.&nbsp; Then he
beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, &ldquo;Father,
father!&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t hurt the creature who is so fond
of you!&nbsp; O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down
crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked
his face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her,
took her hand, and sat down beside her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Finish by telling me how your father left you,
Sissy.&nbsp; Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the
end.&nbsp; The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Miss Louisa,&rsquo; said Sissy, covering her eyes,
and sobbing yet; &lsquo;I came home from the school that
afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the
booth.&nbsp; And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as if he
was in pain.&nbsp; And I said, &ldquo;Have you hurt yourself,
father?&rdquo; (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he
said, &ldquo;A little, my darling.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when I came
to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was
crying.&nbsp; The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face;
and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but &ldquo;My
darling;&rdquo; and &ldquo;My love!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a
coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but
himself, and not much of that at present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,&rsquo; observed
his sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have no occasion to go away; but
don&rsquo;t interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! very well!&rsquo; returned Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only
father has brought old Bounderby home, and I want you to come
into the drawing-room.&nbsp; Because if you come, there&rsquo;s a
good chance of old Bounderby&rsquo;s asking me to dinner; and if
you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;to
make sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy resumed in a lower voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;At last poor
father said that he had given no satisfaction again, and never
did give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame and
disgrace, and I should have done better without him all
along.&nbsp; I said all the affectionate things to him that came
into my heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him,
and told him all about the school and everything that had been
said and done there.&nbsp; When I had no more left to tell, he
put his arms round my neck, and kissed me a great many
times.&nbsp; Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used,
for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best place,
which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after
kissing me again, he let me go.&nbsp; When I had gone
down-stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more
company to him yet, and looked in at the door, and said,
&ldquo;Father dear, shall I take Merrylegs?&rdquo;&nbsp; Father
shook his head and said, &ldquo;No, Sissy, no; take nothing
that&rsquo;s known to be mine, my darling;&rdquo; and I left him
sitting by the fire.&nbsp; Then the thought must have come upon
him, poor, poor father! of going away to try something for my
sake; for when I came back, he was gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say!&nbsp; Look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!&rsquo;
Tom remonstrated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no more to tell, Miss Louisa.&nbsp; I
keep the nine oils ready for him, and I know he will come
back.&nbsp; Every letter that I see in Mr. Gradgrind&rsquo;s hand
takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for I think it comes
from father, or from Mr. Sleary about father.&nbsp; Mr. Sleary
promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and
I trust to him to keep his word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!&rsquo; said Tom,
with an impatient whistle.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be off if you
don&rsquo;t look sharp!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind
in the presence of his family, and said in a faltering way,
&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir, for being
troublesome&mdash;but&mdash;have you had any letter yet about
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Louisa would suspend the occupation of the
moment, whatever it was, and look for the reply as earnestly as
Sissy did.&nbsp; And when Mr. Gradgrind regularly answered,
&lsquo;No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,&rsquo; the trembling of
Sissy&rsquo;s lip would be repeated in Louisa&rsquo;s face, and
her eyes would follow Sissy with compassion to the door.&nbsp;
Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these occasions by remarking, when
she was gone, that if Jupe had been properly trained from an
early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound
principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.&nbsp; Yet
it did seem (though not to him, for he saw nothing of it) as if
fantastic hope could take as strong a hold as Fact.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>This
observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter.&nbsp; As
to Tom, he was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of
calculation which is usually at work on number one.&nbsp; As to
Mrs. Gradgrind, if she said anything on the subject, she would
come a little way out of her wrappers, like a feminine dormouse,
and say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious bless me, how my poor head is vexed and
worried by that girl Jupe&rsquo;s so perseveringly asking, over
and over again, about her tiresome letters!&nbsp; Upon my word
and honour I seem to be fated, and destined, and ordained, to
live in the midst of things that I am never to hear the last
of.&nbsp; It really is a most extraordinary circumstance that it
appears as if I never was to hear the last of
anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At about this point, Mr. Gradgrind&rsquo;s eye would fall upon
her; and under the influence of that wintry piece of fact, she
would become torpid again.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">entertain</span> a weak idea that the
English people are as hard-worked as any people upon whom the sun
shines.&nbsp; I acknowledge to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy, as a
reason why I would give them a little more play.</p>
<p>In the hardest working part of Coketown; in the innermost
fortifications of that ugly citadel, where Nature was as strongly
bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in; at the
heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close
streets upon streets, which had come into existence piecemeal,
every piece in a violent hurry for some one man&rsquo;s purpose,
and the whole an unnatural family, shouldering, and trampling,
and pressing one another to death; in the last close nook of this
great exhausted receiver, where the chimneys, for want of air to
make a draught, were built in an immense variety of stunted and
crooked shapes, as though every house put out a sign of the kind
of people who might be expected to be born in it; among the
multitude of Coketown, generically called &lsquo;the
Hands,&rsquo;&mdash;a race who would have found more favour with
some people, if Providence had seen fit to make them only hands,
or, like the lower creatures of the seashore, only hands and
stomachs&mdash;lived a certain Stephen Blackpool, forty years of
age.</p>
<p>Stephen looked older, but he had had a hard life.&nbsp; It is
said that every life has its roses and thorns; there seemed,
however, to have been a misadventure or mistake in
Stephen&rsquo;s case, whereby somebody else had become possessed
of his roses, and he had become possessed of the same somebody
else&rsquo;s thorns in addition to his own.&nbsp; He had known,
to use his words, a peck of trouble.&nbsp; He was usually called
Old Stephen, in a kind of rough homage to the fact.</p>
<p>A rather stooping man, with a knitted brow, a pondering
expression of face, and a hard-looking head sufficiently
capacious, on which his iron-grey hair lay long and thin, Old
Stephen might have passed for a particularly intelligent man in
his condition.&nbsp; Yet he was not.&nbsp; He took no place among
those remarkable &lsquo;Hands,&rsquo; who, piecing together their
broken intervals of leisure through many years, had mastered
difficult sciences, and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely
things.&nbsp; He held no station among the Hands who could make
speeches and carry on debates.&nbsp; Thousands of his compeers
could talk much better than he, at any time.&nbsp; He was a good
power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect integrity.&nbsp; What
more he was, or what else he had in him, if anything, let him
show for himself.</p>
<p>The lights in the great factories, which looked, when they
were illuminated, like Fairy palaces&mdash;or the travellers by
express-train said so&mdash;were all extinguished; and the bells
had rung for knocking off for the night, and had ceased again;
and the Hands, men and women, boy and girl, were clattering
home.&nbsp; Old Stephen was standing in the street, with the old
sensation upon him which the stoppage of the machinery always
produced&mdash;the sensation of its having worked and stopped in
his own head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet I don&rsquo;t see Rachael, still!&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>It was a wet night, and many groups of young women passed him,
with their shawls drawn over their bare heads and held close
under their chins to keep the rain out.&nbsp; He knew Rachael
well, for a glance at any one of these groups was sufficient to
show him that she was not there.&nbsp; At last, there were no
more to come; and then he turned away, saying in a tone of
disappointment, &lsquo;Why, then, ha&rsquo; missed
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, he had not gone the length of three streets, when he saw
another of the shawled figures in advance of him, at which he
looked so keenly that perhaps its mere shadow indistinctly
reflected on the wet pavement&mdash;if he could have seen it
without the figure itself moving along from lamp to lamp,
brightening and fading as it went&mdash;would have been enough to
tell him who was there.&nbsp; Making his pace at once much
quicker and much softer, he darted on until he was very near this
figure, then fell into his former walk, and called
&lsquo;Rachael!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned, being then in the brightness of a lamp; and
raising her hood a little, showed a quiet oval face, dark and
rather delicate, irradiated by a pair of very gentle eyes, and
further set off by the perfect order of her shining black
hair.&nbsp; It was not a face in its first bloom; she was a woman
five and thirty years of age.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, lad!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis thou?&rsquo;&nbsp; When she
had said this, with a smile which would have been quite
expressed, though nothing of her had been seen but her pleasant
eyes, she replaced her hood again, and they went on together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought thou wast ahind me, Rachael?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Early t&rsquo;night, lass?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Times I&rsquo;m a little early, Stephen!
&rsquo;times a little late.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m never to be counted
on, going home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor going t&rsquo;other way, neither, &rsquo;t seems to
me, Rachael?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Stephen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with some disappointment in his face, but
with a respectful and patient conviction that she must be right
in whatever she did.&nbsp; The expression was not lost upon her;
she laid her hand lightly on his arm a moment as if to thank him
for it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are such true friends, lad, and such old friends,
and getting to be such old folk, now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Rachael, thou&rsquo;rt as young as ever thou
wast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of us would be puzzled how to get old, Stephen,
without &rsquo;t other getting so too, both being alive,&rsquo;
she answered, laughing; &lsquo;but, anyways, we&rsquo;re such old
friends, and t&rsquo; hide a word of honest truth fro&rsquo; one
another would be a sin and a pity.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis better not to
walk too much together.&nbsp; &rsquo;Times, yes!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twould be hard, indeed, if &rsquo;twas not to be at
all,&rsquo; she said, with a cheerfulness she sought to
communicate to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis hard, anyways, Rachael.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Try to think not; and &rsquo;twill seem
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve tried a long time, and &rsquo;ta&rsquo;nt
got better.&nbsp; But thou&rsquo;rt right; &rsquo;t might mak fok
talk, even of thee.&nbsp; Thou hast been that to me, Rachael,
through so many year: thou hast done me so much good, and
heartened of me in that cheering way, that thy word is a law to
me.&nbsp; Ah, lass, and a bright good law!&nbsp; Better than some
real ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fret about them, Stephen,&rsquo; she answered
quickly, and not without an anxious glance at his face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let the laws be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, with a slow nod or two.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let &rsquo;em be.&nbsp; Let everything be.&nbsp; Let all
sorts alone.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a muddle, and that&rsquo;s
aw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always a muddle?&rsquo; said Rachael, with another
gentle touch upon his arm, as if to recall him out of the
thoughtfulness, in which he was biting the long ends of his loose
neckerchief as he walked along.&nbsp; The touch had its
instantaneous effect.&nbsp; He let them fall, turned a smiling
face upon her, and said, as he broke into a good-humoured laugh,
&lsquo;Ay, Rachael, lass, awlus a muddle.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
where I stick.&nbsp; I come to the muddle many times and agen,
and I never get beyond it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had walked some distance, and were near their own
homes.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s was the first reached.&nbsp; It
was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite
undertaker (who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly
pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a black ladder, in order that
those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow
stairs might slide out of this working world by the
windows.&nbsp; She stopped at the corner, and putting her hand in
his, wished him good night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good night, dear lass; good night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went, with her neat figure and her sober womanly step,
down the dark street, and he stood looking after her until she
turned into one of the small houses.&nbsp; There was not a
flutter of her coarse shawl, perhaps, but had its interest in
this man&rsquo;s eyes; not a tone of her voice but had its echo
in his innermost heart.</p>
<p>When she was lost to his view, he pursued his homeward way,
glancing up sometimes at the sky, where the clouds were sailing
fast and wildly.&nbsp; But, they were broken now, and the rain
had ceased, and the moon shone,&mdash;looking down the high
chimneys of Coketown on the deep furnaces below, and casting
Titanic shadows of the steam-engines at rest, upon the walls
where they were lodged.&nbsp; The man seemed to have brightened
with the night, as he went on.</p>
<p>His home, in such another street as the first, saving that it
was narrower, was over a little shop.&nbsp; How it came to pass
that any people found it worth their while to sell or buy the
wretched little toys, mixed up in its window with cheap
newspapers and pork (there was a leg to be raffled for
to-morrow-night), matters not here.&nbsp; He took his end of
candle from a shelf, lighted it at another end of candle on the
counter, without disturbing the mistress of the shop who was
asleep in her little room, and went upstairs into his
lodging.</p>
<p>It was a room, not unacquainted with the black ladder under
various tenants; but as neat, at present, as such a room could
be.&nbsp; A few books and writings were on an old bureau in a
corner, the furniture was decent and sufficient, and, though the
atmosphere was tainted, the room was clean.</p>
<p>Going to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round
three-legged table standing there, he stumbled against
something.&nbsp; As he recoiled, looking down at it, it raised
itself up into the form of a woman in a sitting attitude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s mercy, woman!&rsquo; he cried, falling
farther off from the figure.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hast thou come back
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a woman!&nbsp; A disabled, drunken creature, barely able
to preserve her sitting posture by steadying herself with one
begrimed hand on the floor, while the other was so purposeless in
trying to <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>push away her tangled hair from her face, that it only
blinded her the more with the dirt upon it.&nbsp; A creature so
foul to look at, in her tatters, stains and splashes, but so much
fouler than that in her moral infamy, that it was a shameful
thing even to see her.</p>
<p>After an impatient oath or two, and some stupid clawing of
herself with the hand not necessary to her support, she got her
hair away from her eyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of
him.&nbsp; Then she sat swaying her body to and fro, and making
gestures with her unnerved arm, which seemed intended as the
accompaniment to a fit of laughter, though her face was stolid
and drowsy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eigh, lad?&nbsp; What, yo&rsquo;r there?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Some hoarse sounds meant for this, came mockingly out of her at
last; and her head dropped forward on her breast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Back agen?&rsquo; she screeched, after some minutes, as
if he had that moment said it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; And back
agen.&nbsp; Back agen ever and ever so often.&nbsp; Back?&nbsp;
Yes, back.&nbsp; Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roused by the unmeaning violence with which she cried it out,
she scrambled up, and stood supporting herself with her shoulders
against the wall; dangling in one hand by the string, a
dunghill-fragment of a bonnet, and trying to look scornfully at
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll sell thee off again, and I&rsquo;ll sell
thee off again, and I&rsquo;ll sell thee off a score of
times!&rsquo; she cried, with something between a furious menace
and an effort at a defiant dance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come awa&rsquo;
from th&rsquo; bed!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was sitting on the side of
it, with his face hidden in his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come awa!
from &rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis mine, and I&rsquo;ve a right to
t&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she staggered to it, he avoided her with a shudder, and
passed&mdash;his face still hidden&mdash;to the opposite end of
the room.&nbsp; She threw herself upon the bed heavily, and soon
was snoring hard.&nbsp; He sunk into a chair, and moved but once
all that night.&nbsp; It was to throw a covering over her; as if
his hands were not enough to hide her, even in the darkness.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NO WAY OUT</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fairy palaces burst into
illumination, before pale morning showed the monstrous serpents
of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown.&nbsp; A clattering of
clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and all the
melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the
day&rsquo;s monotony, were at their heavy exercise again.</p>
<p>Stephen bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and steady.&nbsp;
A special contrast, as every man was in the forest of looms where
Stephen worked, to the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of
mechanism at which he laboured.&nbsp; Never fear, good people of
an anxious turn of mind, that Art will consign Nature to
oblivion.&nbsp; Set anywhere, side by side, the work of <span
class="smcap">God</span> and the work of man; and the former,
even though it be a troop of Hands of very small account, will
gain in dignity from the comparison.</p>
<p>So many hundred Hands in this Mill; so many hundred horse
Steam Power.&nbsp; It is known, to the force of a single pound
weight, what the engine will do; but, not all the calculators of
the National Debt can tell me the capacity for good or evil, for
love or hatred, for patriotism or discontent, for the
decomposition of virtue into vice, or the reverse, at any single
moment in the soul of one of these its quiet servants, with the
composed faces and the regulated actions.&nbsp; There is no
mystery in it; there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of
them, for ever.&mdash;Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic
for material objects, and to govern these awful unknown
quantities by other means!</p>
<p>The day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even against
the flaming lights within.&nbsp; The lights were turned out, and
the work went on.&nbsp; The rain fell, and the Smoke-serpents,
submissive to the curse of all that tribe, trailed themselves
upon the earth.&nbsp; In the waste-yard outside, the steam from
the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the shining
heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of
mist and rain.</p>
<p>The work went on, until the noon-bell rang.&nbsp; More
clattering upon the pavements.&nbsp; The looms, and wheels, and
Hands all out of gear for an hour.</p>
<p>Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold
wet streets, haggard and worn.&nbsp; He turned from his own class
and his own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he
walked along, towards the hill on which his principal employer
lived, in a red house with black outside shutters, green inside
blinds, a black street door, up two white steps, <span
class="smcap">Bounderby</span> (in letters very like himself)
upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen door-handle underneath
it, like a brazen full-stop.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch.&nbsp; So Stephen had
expected.&nbsp; Would his servant say that one of the Hands
begged leave to speak to him?&nbsp; Message in return, requiring
name of such Hand.&nbsp; Stephen Blackpool.&nbsp; There was
nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might come
in.</p>
<p>Stephen Blackpool in the parlour.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby (whom he
just knew by sight), at lunch on chop and sherry.&nbsp; Mrs.
Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with
one foot in a cotton stirrup.&nbsp; It was a part, at once of
Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s dignity and service, not to lunch.&nbsp; She
supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own
stately person she considered lunch a weakness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Stephen,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with <i>you</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen made a bow.&nbsp; Not a servile one&mdash;these Hands
will never do that!&nbsp; Lord bless you, sir, you&rsquo;ll never
catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty
years!&mdash;and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit,
tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, you know,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, taking some
sherry, &lsquo;we have never had any difficulty with you, and you
have never been one of the unreasonable ones.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t expect to be set up in a coach and six, and to be fed
on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a good many of
&rsquo;em do!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby always represented this
to be the sole, immediate, and direct object of any Hand who was
not entirely satisfied; &lsquo;and therefore I know already that
you have not come here to make a complaint.&nbsp; Now, you know,
I am certain of that, beforehand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, sure I ha&rsquo; not coom for nowt o&rsquo;
th&rsquo; kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwithstanding his
previous strong conviction.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a steady Hand, and I was not
mistaken.&nbsp; Now, let me hear what it&rsquo;s all about.&nbsp;
As it&rsquo;s not that, let me hear what it is.&nbsp; What have
you got to say?&nbsp; Out with it, lad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I can go, Mr. Bounderby, if you wish it,&rsquo; said that
self-sacrificing lady, making a feint of taking her foot out of
the stirrup.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby stayed her, by holding a mouthful of chop in
suspension before swallowing it, and putting out his left
hand.&nbsp; Then, withdrawing his hand and swallowing his
mouthful of chop, he said to Stephen:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you know, this good lady is a born lady, a high
lady.&nbsp; You are not to suppose because she keeps my house for
me, that she hasn&rsquo;t been very high up the tree&mdash;ah, up
at the top of the tree!&nbsp; Now, if you have got anything to
say that can&rsquo;t be said before a born lady, this lady will
leave the room.&nbsp; If what you have got to say <i>can</i> be
said before a born lady, this lady will stay where she
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I hope I never had nowt to say, not fitten for a
born lady to year, sin&rsquo; I were born mysen&rsquo;,&rsquo;
was the reply, accompanied with a slight flush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, pushing away his
plate, and leaning back.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fire away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha&rsquo; coom,&rsquo; Stephen began, raising his
eyes from the floor, after a moment&rsquo;s consideration,
&lsquo;to ask yo yor advice.&nbsp; I need &rsquo;t
overmuch.&nbsp; I were married on Eas&rsquo;r Monday nineteen
year sin, long and dree.&nbsp; She were a young lass&mdash;pretty
enow&mdash;wi&rsquo; good accounts of herseln.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp;
She went bad&mdash;soon.&nbsp; Not along of me.&nbsp; Gonnows I
were not a unkind husband to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard all this before,&rsquo; said Mr.
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;She took to drinking, left off working,
sold the furniture, pawned the clothes, and played old
Gooseberry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I were patient wi&rsquo; her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;The more fool you, I think,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
in confidence to his wine-glass.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;I were very patient wi&rsquo; her.&nbsp; I tried to
wean her fra &rsquo;t ower and ower agen.&nbsp; I tried this, I
tried that, I tried t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; gone home,
many&rsquo;s the time, and found all vanished as I had in the
world, and her without a sense left to bless herseln lying on
bare ground.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; dun &rsquo;t not once, not
twice&mdash;twenty time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Every line in his face deepened as he said it, and put in its
affecting evidence of the suffering he had undergone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From bad to worse, from worse to worsen.&nbsp; She left
me.&nbsp; She disgraced herseln everyways, bitter and bad.&nbsp;
She coom back, she coom back, she coom back.&nbsp; What could I
do t&rsquo; hinder her?&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; walked the streets
nights long, ere ever I&rsquo;d go home.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; gone
t&rsquo; th&rsquo; brigg, minded to fling myseln ower, and
ha&rsquo; no more on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; bore that much,
that I were owd when I were young.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit, easily ambling along with her netting-needles,
raised the Coriolanian eyebrows and shook her head, as much as to
say, &lsquo;The great know trouble as well as the small.&nbsp;
Please to turn your humble eye in My direction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha&rsquo; paid her to keep awa&rsquo; fra&rsquo;
me.&nbsp; These five year I ha&rsquo; paid her.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo;
gotten decent fewtrils about me agen.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; lived
hard and sad, but not ashamed and fearfo&rsquo; a&rsquo; the
minnits o&rsquo; my life.&nbsp; Last night, I went home.&nbsp;
There she lay upon my har-stone!&nbsp; There she is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the strength of his misfortune, and the energy of his
distress, he fired for the moment like a proud man.&nbsp; In
another moment, he stood as he had stood all the time&mdash;his
usual stoop upon him; his pondering face addressed to Mr.
Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half shrewd, half
perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something
very difficult; his hat held tight in his left hand, which rested
on his hip; his right arm, with a rugged propriety and force of
action, very earnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so
when it always paused, a little bent, but not withdrawn, as he
paused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was acquainted with all this, you know,&rsquo; said
Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;except the last clause, long ago.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a bad job; that&rsquo;s what it is.&nbsp; You had
better have been satisfied as you were, and not have got
married.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s too late to say
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of
years?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hear what this lady asks.&nbsp; Was it an unequal
marriage in point of years, this unlucky job of yours?&rsquo;
said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not e&rsquo;en so.&nbsp; I were one-and-twenty myseln;
she were twenty nighbut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, sir?&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief,
with great placidity.&nbsp; &lsquo;I inferred, from its being so
miserable a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in
point of years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long
way that had an odd sheepishness about it.&nbsp; He fortified
himself with a little more sherry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you go on?&rsquo; he then
asked, turning rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha&rsquo; coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded
o&rsquo; this woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen infused a yet deeper
gravity into the mixed expression of his attentive face.&nbsp;
Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having received a
moral shock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said Bounderby, getting up to
lean his back against the chimney-piece.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are
you talking about?&nbsp; You took her for better for
worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mun&rsquo; be ridden o&rsquo; her.&nbsp; I cannot
bear &rsquo;t nommore.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; lived under &rsquo;t so
long, for that I ha&rsquo; had&rsquo;n the pity and comforting
words o&rsquo; th&rsquo; best lass living or dead.&nbsp; Haply,
but for her, I should ha&rsquo; gone battering mad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wishes to be free, to marry the female of whom he
speaks, I fear, sir,&rsquo; observed Mrs. Sparsit in an
undertone, and much dejected by the immorality of the people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&nbsp; The lady says what&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; I
do.&nbsp; I were a coming to &rsquo;t.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; read
i&rsquo; th&rsquo; papers that great folk (fair faw &rsquo;em
a&rsquo;!&nbsp; I wishes &rsquo;em no hurt!) are not bonded
together for better for worst so fast, but that they can be set
free fro&rsquo; <i>their</i> misfortnet marriages, an&rsquo;
marry ower agen.&nbsp; When they dunnot agree, for that their
tempers is ill-sorted, they has rooms o&rsquo; one kind an&rsquo;
another in their houses, above a bit, and they can live
asunders.&nbsp; We fok ha&rsquo; only one room, and we
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; When that won&rsquo;t do, they ha&rsquo; gowd
an&rsquo; other cash, an&rsquo; they can say &ldquo;This for
yo&rsquo; an&rsquo; that for me,&rdquo; an&rsquo; they can go
their separate ways.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Spite o&rsquo;
all that, they can be set free for smaller wrongs than
mine.&nbsp; So, I mun be ridden o&rsquo; this woman, and I want
t&rsquo; know how?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No how,&rsquo; returned Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I do her any hurt, sir, there&rsquo;s a law to
punish me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course there is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I flee from her, there&rsquo;s a law to punish
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course there is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I marry t&rsquo;oother dear lass, there&rsquo;s a
law to punish me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course there is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I was to live wi&rsquo; her an&rsquo; not marry
her&mdash;saying such a thing could be, which it never could or
would, an&rsquo; her so good&mdash;there&rsquo;s a law to punish
me, in every innocent child belonging to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course there is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, a&rsquo; God&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; said Stephen
Blackpool, &lsquo;show me the law to help me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hem!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a sanctity in this relation of
life,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;it
must be kept up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No no, dunnot say that, sir.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tan&rsquo;t
kep&rsquo; up that way.&nbsp; Not that way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
kep&rsquo; down that way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a weaver, I were in a
fact&rsquo;ry when a chilt, but I ha&rsquo; gotten een to see
wi&rsquo; and eern to year wi&rsquo;.&nbsp; I read in th&rsquo;
papers every &rsquo;Sizes, every Sessions&mdash;and you read
too&mdash;I know it!&mdash;with dismay&mdash;how th&rsquo;
supposed unpossibility o&rsquo; ever getting unchained from one
another, at any price, on any terms, brings blood upon this land,
and brings many common married fok to battle, murder, and sudden
death.&nbsp; Let us ha&rsquo; this, right understood.&nbsp;
Mine&rsquo;s a grievous case, an&rsquo; I want&mdash;if yo will
be so good&mdash;t&rsquo; know the law that helps me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I tell you what!&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
putting his hands in his pockets.&nbsp; &lsquo;There <i>is</i>
such a law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen, subsiding into his quiet manner, and never wandering
in his attention, gave a nod.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s not for you at all.&nbsp; It costs
money.&nbsp; It costs a mint of money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much might that be?&rsquo; Stephen calmly
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;d have to go to Doctors&rsquo; Commons
with a suit, and you&rsquo;d have to go to a court of Common Law
with a suit, and you&rsquo;d have to go to the House of Lords
with a suit, and you&rsquo;d have to get an Act of Parliament to
enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it was a
case of very plain sailing), I suppose from a thousand to fifteen
hundred pound,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps
twice the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no other law?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why then, sir,&rsquo; said Stephen, turning white, and
motioning with that right hand of his, as if he gave everything
to the four winds, &lsquo;&rsquo;<i>tis</i> a muddle.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis just a muddle a&rsquo;toogether, an&rsquo; the sooner
I am dead, the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the
people.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pooh, pooh!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you talk nonsense, my
good fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;about things you
don&rsquo;t understand; and don&rsquo;t you call the Institutions
of your country a muddle, or you&rsquo;ll get yourself into a
real muddle one of these fine mornings.&nbsp; The institutions of
your country are not your piece-work, and the only thing you have
got to do, is, to mind your piece-work.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t
take your wife <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>for fast and for loose; but for better for worse.&nbsp;
If she has turned out worse&mdash;why, all we have got to say is,
she might have turned out better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a muddle,&rsquo; said Stephen, shaking his
head as he moved to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a&rsquo; a
muddle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what!&rsquo; Mr. Bounderby
resumed, as a valedictory address.&nbsp; &lsquo;With what I shall
call your unhallowed opinions, you have been quite shocking this
lady: who, as I have already told you, is a born lady, and who,
as I have not already told you, has had her own marriage
misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds&mdash;tens
of Thousands of Pounds!&rsquo; (he repeated it with great
relish).&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, you have always been a steady Hand
hitherto; but my opinion is, and so I tell you plainly, that you
are turning into the wrong road.&nbsp; You have been listening to
some mischievous stranger or other&mdash;they&rsquo;re always
about&mdash;and the best thing you can do is, to come out of
that.&nbsp; Now you know;&rsquo; here his countenance expressed
marvellous acuteness; &lsquo;I can see as far into a grindstone
as another man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because I had
my nose well kept to it when I was young.&nbsp; I see traces of
the turtle soup, and venison, and gold spoon in this.&nbsp; Yes,
I do!&rsquo; cried Mr. Bounderby, shaking his head with obstinate
cunning.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the Lord Harry, I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen
said, &lsquo;Thank you, sir, I wish you good day.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall,
as if he were going to explode himself into it; and Mrs. Sparsit
still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup, looking quite cast
down by the popular vices.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE OLD WOMAN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Stephen</span> descended the two white
steps, shutting the black door with the brazen door-plate, by the
aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he gave a parting polish
with the sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot hand clouded
it.&nbsp; He crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the
ground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he felt a
touch upon his arm.</p>
<p>It was not the touch he needed most at such a moment&mdash;the
touch that could calm the wild waters of his soul, as the
uplifted hand of the sublimest love and patience could abate the
raging of the sea&mdash;yet it was a woman&rsquo;s hand
too.&nbsp; It was an old woman, tall and shapely still, though
withered by time, on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and
turned.&nbsp; She was very cleanly and plainly dressed, had
country mud upon her shoes, and was newly come from a
journey.&nbsp; The flutter of her manner, in the unwonted noise
of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the
heavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered
gloves, to which her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman
from the country, in her plain holiday clothes, come into
Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence.&nbsp; Remarking
this at a glance, with the quick observation of his class,
Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face&mdash;his face, which,
like the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with
eyes and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired
the concentrated look with which we are familiar in the
countenances of the deaf&mdash;the better to hear what she asked
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, sir,&rsquo; said the old woman,
&lsquo;didn&rsquo;t I see you come out of that gentleman&rsquo;s
house?&rsquo; pointing back to Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to
mistake the person in following?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, missus,&rsquo; returned Stephen, &lsquo;it were
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll excuse an old woman&rsquo;s
curiosity&mdash;have you seen the gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, missus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how did he look, sir?&nbsp; Was he portly, bold,
outspoken, and hearty?&rsquo;&nbsp; As she straightened her own
figure, and held up her head in adapting her action to her words,
the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old woman before,
and had not quite liked her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; he returned, observing her more
attentively, &lsquo;he were all that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And healthy,&rsquo; said the old woman, &lsquo;as the
fresh wind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; returned Stephen.&nbsp; &lsquo;He were
ett&rsquo;n and drinking&mdash;as large and as loud as a
Hummobee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo; said the old woman, with infinite
content.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He certainly never had seen this old woman before.&nbsp; Yet
there was a vague remembrance in his mind, as if he had more than
once dreamed of some old woman like her.</p>
<p>She walked along at his side, and, gently accommodating
himself to her humour, he said Coketown was a busy place, was it
not?&nbsp; To which she answered &lsquo;Eigh sure!&nbsp; Dreadful
busy!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he said, she came from the country, he
saw?&nbsp; To which she answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Parliamentary, this morning.&nbsp; I came forty mile
by Parliamentary this morning, and I&rsquo;m going back the same
forty mile this afternoon.&nbsp; I walked nine mile to the
station this morning, and if I find nobody on the road to give me
a lift, I shall walk the nine mile back to-night.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s pretty well, sir, at my age!&rsquo; said the chatty
old woman, her eye brightening with exultation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Deed &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t do&rsquo;t
too often, missus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no.&nbsp; Once a year,&rsquo; she answered, shaking
her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I spend my savings so, once every
year.&nbsp; I come regular, to tramp about the streets, and see
the gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to see &rsquo;em?&rsquo; returned Stephen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough for me,&rsquo; she replied, with
great earnestness and interest of manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ask no
more!&nbsp; I have been standing about, on this side of the way,
to see that gentleman,&rsquo; turning her head back towards Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s again, &lsquo;come out.&nbsp; But, he&rsquo;s
late this year, and I have not seen him.&nbsp; You came out
instead.&nbsp; Now, if I am obliged to go back without a glimpse
of him&mdash;I only want a glimpse&mdash;well!&nbsp; I have seen
you, and you have seen him, and I must make that do.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Saying this, she looked at Stephen as if to fix his features in
her mind, and her eye was not so bright as it had been.</p>
<p>With a large allowance for difference of tastes, and with all
submission to the patricians of Coketown, this seemed so
extraordinary a source of interest to take so much trouble about,
that it perplexed him.&nbsp; But they were passing the church
now, and as his eye caught the clock, he quickened his pace.</p>
<p>He was going to his work? the old woman said, quickening hers,
too, quite easily.&nbsp; Yes, time was nearly out.&nbsp; On his
telling her where he worked, the old woman became a more singular
old woman than before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo;t you happy?&rsquo; she asked him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;there&rsquo;s awmost nobbody but has their
troubles, missus.&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered evasively, because the
old woman appeared to take it for granted that he would be very
happy indeed, and he had not the heart to disappoint her.&nbsp;
He knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the
old woman had lived so long, and could count upon his having so
little, why so much the better for her, and none the worse for
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay!&nbsp; You have your troubles at home, you
mean?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Times.&nbsp; Just now and then,&rsquo; he answered,
slightly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, working under such a gentleman, they don&rsquo;t
follow you to the Factory?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, no; they didn&rsquo;t follow him there, said
Stephen.&nbsp; All correct there.&nbsp; Everything accordant
there.&nbsp; (He did not go so far as to say, for her pleasure,
that there was a sort of Divine Right there; but, I have heard
claims almost as magnificent of late years.)</p>
<p>They were now in the black by-road near the place, and the
Hands were crowding in.&nbsp; The bell was ringing, and the
Serpent was a Serpent of many coils, and the Elephant was getting
ready.&nbsp; The strange old woman was delighted with the very
bell.&nbsp; It was the beautifullest bell she had ever heard, she
said, and sounded grand!</p>
<p>She asked him, when he stopped good-naturedly to shake hands
with her before going in, how long he had worked there?</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dozen year,&rsquo; he told her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must kiss the hand,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that has
worked in this fine factory for a dozen year!&rsquo;&nbsp; And
she lifted it, though he would have prevented her, and put it to
her lips.&nbsp; What harmony, besides her age and her simplicity,
surrounded her, he did not know, but even in this fantastic
action there was a something neither out of time nor place: a
something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as
serious, or done with such a natural and touching air.</p>
<p>He had been at his loom full half an hour, thinking about this
old woman, when, having occasion to move round the loom for its
adjustment, he glanced through a window which was in his corner,
and saw her still looking up at the pile of building, lost in
admiration.&nbsp; Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet, and of
her two long journeys, she was gazing at it, as if the heavy
thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to
her.</p>
<p>She was gone by and by, and the day went after her, and the
lights sprung up again, and the Express whirled in full sight of
the Fairy Palace over the arches near: little felt amid the
jarring of the machinery, and scarcely heard above its crash and
rattle.&nbsp; Long before then his thoughts had gone back to the
dreary room above the little shop, and to the shameful figure
heavy on the bed, but heavier on his heart.</p>
<p>Machinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse;
stopped.&nbsp; The bell again; the glare of light and heat
dispelled; the factories, looming heavy in the black wet
night&mdash;their tall chimneys rising up into the air like
competing Towers of Babel.</p>
<p>He had spoken to Rachael only last night, it was true, and had
walked with her a little way; but he had his new misfortune on
him, in which no one else could give him a moment&rsquo;s relief,
and, for the sake of it, and because he knew himself to want that
softening of his anger which no voice but hers could effect, he
felt he might so far disregard what she had said as to wait for
her again.&nbsp; He waited, but she had eluded him.&nbsp; She was
gone.&nbsp; On no other night in the year could he so ill have
spared her patient face.</p>
<p>O!&nbsp; Better to have no home in which to lay his head, than
to have a home and dread to go to it, through such a cause.&nbsp;
He ate and drank, for he was exhausted&mdash;but he little knew
or cared what; and he wandered about in the chill rain, thinking
and thinking, and brooding and brooding.</p>
<p>No word of a new marriage had ever passed between them; but
Rachael had taken great pity on him years ago, and to her alone
he had opened his closed heart all this time, on the subject of
his <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>miseries; and he knew very well that if he were free to
ask her, she would take him.&nbsp; He thought of the home he
might at that moment have been seeking with pleasure and pride;
of the different man he might have been that night; of the
lightness then in his now heavy-laden breast; of the then
restored honour, self-respect, and tranquillity all torn to
pieces.&nbsp; He thought of the waste of the best part of his
life, of the change it made in his character for the worse every
day, of the dreadful nature of his existence, bound hand and
foot, to a dead woman, and tormented by a demon in her
shape.&nbsp; He thought of Rachael, how young when they were
first brought together in these circumstances, how mature now,
how soon to grow old.&nbsp; He thought of the number of girls and
women she had seen marry, how many homes with children in them
she had seen grow up around her, how she had contentedly pursued
her own lone quiet path&mdash;for him&mdash;and how he had
sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed face, that
smote him with remorse and despair.&nbsp; He set the picture of
her up, beside the infamous image of last night; and thought,
Could it be, that the whole earthly course of one so gentle,
good, and self-denying, was subjugate to such a wretch as
that!</p>
<p>Filled with these thoughts&mdash;so filled that he had an
unwholesome sense of growing larger, of being placed in some new
and diseased relation towards the objects among which he passed,
of seeing the iris round every misty light turn red&mdash;he went
home for shelter.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">RACHAEL</span></h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">candle</span> faintly burned in the
window, to which the black ladder had often been raised for the
sliding away of all that was most precious in this world to a
striving wife and a brood of hungry babies; and Stephen added to
his other thoughts the stern reflection, that of all the
casualties of this existence upon earth, not one was dealt out
with so unequal a hand as Death.&nbsp; The inequality of Birth
was nothing to it.&nbsp; For, say that the child of a King and
the child of a Weaver were born to-night in the same moment, what
was that disparity, to the death of any human creature who was
serviceable to, or beloved by, another, while this abandoned
woman lived on!</p>
<p>From the outside of his home he gloomily passed to the inside,
with suspended breath and with a slow footstep.&nbsp; He went up
to his door, opened it, and so into the room.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Quiet
and peace were there.&nbsp; Rachael was there, sitting by the
bed.</p>
<p>She turned her head, and the light of her face shone in upon
the midnight of his mind.&nbsp; She sat by the bed, watching and
tending his wife.&nbsp; That is to say, he saw that some one lay
there, and he knew too well it must be she; but Rachael&rsquo;s
hands had put a curtain up, so that she was screened from his
eyes.&nbsp; Her disgraceful garments were removed, and some of
Rachael&rsquo;s were in the room.&nbsp; Everything was in its
place and order as he had always kept it, the little fire was
newly trimmed, and the hearth was freshly swept.&nbsp; It
appeared to him that he saw all this in Rachael&rsquo;s face, and
looked at nothing besides.&nbsp; While looking at it, it was shut
out from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes; but
not before he had seen how earnestly she looked at him, and how
her own eyes were filled too.</p>
<p>She turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that
all was quiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheerful voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you have come at last, Stephen.&nbsp; You are
very late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha&rsquo; been walking up an&rsquo; down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis too bad a night for
that.&nbsp; The rain falls very heavy, and the wind has
risen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wind?&nbsp; True.&nbsp; It was blowing hard.&nbsp; Hark to
the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise!&nbsp; To
have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was
blowing!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen.&nbsp;
Landlady came round for me at dinner-time.&nbsp; There was some
one here that needed looking to, she said.&nbsp; And &lsquo;deed
she was right.&nbsp; All wandering and lost, Stephen.&nbsp;
Wounded too, and bruised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head
before her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for
that she worked with me when we were girls both, and for that you
courted her and married her when I was her
friend&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low
groan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure
and certain that &rsquo;tis far too merciful to let her die, or
even so much as suffer, for want of aid.&nbsp; Thou knowest who
said, &ldquo;Let him who is without sin among you cast the first
stone at her!&rdquo;&nbsp; There have been plenty to do
that.&nbsp; Thou art not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen,
when she is brought so low.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Rachael, Rachael!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward
thee!&rsquo; she said, in compassionate accents.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am thy poor friend, with all my heart and mind.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the
neck of the self-made outcast.&nbsp; She dressed them now, still
without showing her.&nbsp; She steeped a piece of linen in a
basin, into which she poured some liquid from a bottle, and laid
it with a gentle hand upon the sore.&nbsp; The three-legged table
had been drawn close to the bedside, and on it there were two
bottles.&nbsp; This was one.</p>
<p>It was not so far off, but that Stephen, following her hands
with his eyes, could read what was printed on it in large
letters.&nbsp; He turned of a deadly hue, and a sudden horror
seemed to fall upon him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will stay here, Stephen,&rsquo; said Rachael, quietly
resuming her seat, &lsquo;till the bells go Three.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis to be done again at three, and then she may be left
till morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But thy rest agen to-morrow&rsquo;s work, my
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I slept sound last night.&nbsp; I can wake many nights,
when I am put to it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis thou who art in need of
rest&mdash;so white and tired.&nbsp; Try to sleep in the chair
there, while I watch.&nbsp; Thou hadst no sleep last night, I can
well believe.&nbsp; To-morrow&rsquo;s work is far harder for thee
than for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He heard the thundering and surging out of doors, and it
seemed to him as if his late angry mood were going about trying
to get at him.&nbsp; She had cast it out; she would keep it out;
he trusted to her to defend him from himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She don&rsquo;t know me, Stephen; she just drowsily
mutters and stares.&nbsp; I have spoken to her times and again,
but she don&rsquo;t notice!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as well so.&nbsp;
When she comes to her right mind once more, I shall have done
what I can, and she never the wiser.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long, Rachael, is &rsquo;t looked for, that
she&rsquo;ll be so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doctor said she would haply come to her mind
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His eyes fell again on the bottle, and a tremble passed over
him, causing him to shiver in every limb.&nbsp; She thought he
was chilled with the wet.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;it was not that.&nbsp; He had had a fright.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fright?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay! coming in.&nbsp; When I were walking.&nbsp;
When I were thinking.&nbsp; When I&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; It seized
him again; and he stood up, holding by the mantel-shelf, as he
pressed his dank cold hair down with a hand that shook as if it
were palsied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was coming to him, but he stretched out his arm to stop
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t, please; don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Let
me see thee setten by the bed.&nbsp; Let me see thee, a&rsquo; so
good, and so forgiving.&nbsp; Let me see thee as I see thee when
I coom in.&nbsp; I can never see thee better than so.&nbsp;
Never, never, never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had a violent fit of trembling, and then sunk into his
chair.&nbsp; After a time he controlled himself, and, resting
with an elbow on one knee, and his head upon that hand, could
look towards Rachael.&nbsp; Seen across the dim candle with his
moistened eyes, she looked as if she had a glory shining round
her head.&nbsp; He could have believed she had.&nbsp; He did
believe it, as the noise without shook the window, rattled at the
door below, and went about the house clamouring and
lamenting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When she gets better, Stephen, &rsquo;tis to be hoped
she&rsquo;ll leave thee to thyself again, and do thee no more
hurt.&nbsp; Anyways we will hope so now.&nbsp; And now I shall
keep silence, for I want thee to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, more to please her than to rest his weary
head; but, by slow degrees as he listened to the great noise of
the wind, he ceased to hear it, or it changed into the working of
his loom, or even into the voices of the day (his own included)
saying what had been really said.&nbsp; Even this imperfect
consciousness faded away at last, and he dreamed a long, troubled
dream.</p>
<p>He thought that he, and some one on whom his heart had long
been set&mdash;but she was not Rachael, and that surprised him,
even in the midst of his imaginary happiness&mdash;stood in the
church being married.&nbsp; While the ceremony was performing,
and while he recognized among the witnesses some whom he knew to
be living, and many whom he knew to be dead, darkness came on,
succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light.&nbsp; It broke
from one line in the table of commandments at the altar, and
illuminated the building with the words.&nbsp; They were sounded
through the church, too, as if there were voices in the fiery
letters.&nbsp; Upon this, the whole appearance before him and
around him changed, and nothing was left as it had been, but
himself and the clergyman.&nbsp; They stood in the daylight
before a crowd so vast, that if all the people in the world could
have been brought together into one space, they could not have
looked, he thought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him, and
there was not one pitying or friendly eye among the millions that
were fastened on his face.&nbsp; He stood on a raised stage,
under his own loom; and, looking up at the shape the loom took,
and hearing the burial service distinctly read, he knew that he
was there to suffer death.&nbsp; In an instant what he stood on
fell below him, and he was gone.</p>
<p>&mdash;Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life, and
to places that he knew, he was unable to consider; but he was
back in those places by some means, and with this condemnation
upon him, that he was never, in this world or the next, through
all the unimaginable ages of eternity, to look on Rachael&rsquo;s
face or hear her voice.&nbsp; Wandering to and fro, unceasingly,
without hope, and in search of he knew not what (he only knew
that he was doomed to seek it), he was the subject of a nameless,
horrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular shape which
everything took.&nbsp; Whatsoever he looked at, grew into that
form sooner or later.&nbsp; The object of his miserable existence
was to prevent its recognition by any one among the various
people he encountered.&nbsp; Hopeless labour!&nbsp; If he led
them out of rooms where it was, if he shut up drawers and closets
where it stood, if he drew the curious from places where he knew
it to be secreted, and got them out into the streets, the very
chimneys of the mills assumed that shape, and round them was the
printed word.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing again, the rain was beating on the
house-tops, and the larger spaces through which he had strayed
contracted to the four walls of his room.&nbsp; Saving that the
fire had died out, it was as his eyes had closed upon it.&nbsp;
Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze, in the chair by the
bed.&nbsp; She sat wrapped in her shawl, perfectly still.&nbsp;
The table stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on
it, in its real proportions and appearance, was the shape so
often repeated.</p>
<p>He thought he saw the curtain move.&nbsp; He looked again, and
he was sure it moved.&nbsp; He saw a hand come forth and grope
about a little.&nbsp; Then the curtain moved more perceptibly,
and the woman in the bed put it back, and sat up.</p>
<p>With her woful eyes, so haggard and wild, so heavy and large,
she looked all round the room, and passed the corner where he
slept in his chair.&nbsp; Her eyes returned to that corner, and
she put her hand over them as a shade, while she looked into
it.&nbsp; Again they went all round the room, scarcely heeding
Rachael if at all, and returned to that corner.&nbsp; He thought,
as she once more shaded them&mdash;not so much looking at him, as
looking for him with a brutish instinct that he was
there&mdash;that no single trace was left in those debauched
features, or in the mind that went along with them, of the woman
he had married eighteen years before.&nbsp; But that he had seen
her come to this by inches, he never could have believed her to
be the same.</p>
<p>All this time, as if a spell were on him, he was motionless
and powerless, except to watch her.</p>
<p>Stupidly dozing, or communing with her incapable self about
nothing, she sat for a little while with her hands at her ears,
and her head resting on them.&nbsp; Presently, she resumed her
staring round the room.&nbsp; And now, for the first time, her
eyes stopped at the table with the bottles on it.</p>
<p>Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner, with the
defiance of last night, and moving very cautiously and softly,
stretched out her greedy hand.&nbsp; She drew a mug into the bed,
and sat for a while considering which of the two bottles she
should choose.&nbsp; Finally, she laid her insensate grasp upon
the bottle that had swift and certain death in it, and, before
his eyes, pulled out the cork with her teeth.</p>
<p>Dream or reality, he had no voice, nor had he power to
stir.&nbsp; If this be real, and her allotted time be not yet
come, wake, Rachael, wake!</p>
<p>She thought of that, too.&nbsp; She looked at Rachael, and
very slowly, very cautiously, poured out the contents.&nbsp; The
draught was at her lips.&nbsp; A moment and she would be past all
help, let the whole world wake and come about her with its utmost
power.&nbsp; But in that moment Rachael started up with a
suppressed cry.&nbsp; The creature struggled, struck her, seized
her by the hair; but Rachael had the cup.</p>
<p>Stephen broke out of his chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rachael, am I
wakin&rsquo; or dreamin&rsquo; this dreadfo&rsquo;
night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis all well, Stephen.&nbsp; I have been asleep,
myself.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis near three.&nbsp; Hush!&nbsp; I hear the
bells.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the
window.&nbsp; They listened, and it struck three.&nbsp; Stephen
looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the disorder of her
hair, and the red marks of fingers on her forehead, and felt
assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been
awake.&nbsp; She held the cup in her hand even now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it must be near three,&rsquo; she said,
calmly pouring from the cup into the basin, and steeping the
linen as before.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am thankful I stayed!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis done now, when I have put this on.&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
And now she&rsquo;s quiet again.&nbsp; The few drops in the basin
I&rsquo;ll pour away, for &rsquo;tis bad stuff to leave about,
though ever so little of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; As she spoke, she
drained the basin into the ashes of the fire, and broke the
bottle on the hearth.</p>
<p>She had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with her
shawl before going out into the wind and rain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;lt let me walk wi&rsquo; thee at this hour,
Rachael?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Stephen.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but a minute, and
I&rsquo;m home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;rt not fearfo&rsquo;;&rsquo; he said it in a
low voice, as they went out at the door; &lsquo;to leave me alone
wi&rsquo; her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she looked at him, saying, &lsquo;Stephen?&rsquo; he went
down on his knee before her, on the poor mean stairs, and put an
end of her shawl to his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou art an Angel.&nbsp; Bless thee, bless
thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am, as I have told thee, Stephen, thy poor
friend.&nbsp; Angels are not like me.&nbsp; Between them, and a
working woman fu&rsquo; of faults, there is a deep gulf
set.&nbsp; My little sister is among them, but she is
changed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes for a moment as she said the words; and
then they fell again, in all their gentleness and mildness, on
his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou changest me from bad to good.&nbsp; Thou
mak&rsquo;st me humbly wishfo&rsquo; to be more like thee, and
fearfo&rsquo; to lose thee when this life is ower, and a&rsquo;
the muddle cleared awa&rsquo;.&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;rt an Angel; it
may be, thou hast saved my soul alive!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, on his knee at her feet, with her shawl
still in <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>his hand, and the reproof on her lips died away when she
saw the working of his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I coom home desp&rsquo;rate.&nbsp; I coom home
wi&rsquo;out a hope, and mad wi&rsquo; thinking that when I said
a word o&rsquo; complaint I was reckoned a unreasonable
Hand.&nbsp; I told thee I had had a fright.&nbsp; It were the
Poison-bottle on table.&nbsp; I never hurt a livin&rsquo;
creetur; but happenin&rsquo; so suddenly upon &rsquo;t, I thowt,
&ldquo;How can <i>I</i> say what I might ha&rsquo; done to
myseln, or her, or both!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put her two hands on his mouth, with a face of terror, to
stop him from saying more.&nbsp; He caught them in his unoccupied
hand, and holding them, and still clasping the border of her
shawl, said hurriedly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I see thee, Rachael, setten by the bed.&nbsp; I
ha&rsquo; seen thee, aw this night.&nbsp; In my troublous sleep I
ha&rsquo; known thee still to be there.&nbsp; Evermore I will see
thee there.&nbsp; I nevermore will see her or think o&rsquo; her,
but thou shalt be beside her.&nbsp; I nevermore will see or think
o&rsquo; anything that angers me, but thou, so much better than
me, shalt be by th&rsquo; side on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And so I will
try t&rsquo; look t&rsquo; th&rsquo; time, and so I will try
t&rsquo; trust t&rsquo; th&rsquo; time, when thou and me at last
shall walk together far awa&rsquo;, beyond the deep gulf, in
th&rsquo; country where thy little sister is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He kissed the border of her shawl again, and let her go.&nbsp;
She bade him good night in a broken voice, and went out into the
street.</p>
<p>The wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon
appear, and still blew strongly.&nbsp; It had cleared the sky
before it, and the rain had spent itself or travelled elsewhere,
and the stars were bright.&nbsp; He stood bare-headed in the
road, watching her quick disappearance.&nbsp; As the shining
stars were to the heavy candle in the window, so was Rachael, in
the rugged fancy of this man, to the common experiences of his
life.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GREAT MANUFACTURER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> went on in Coketown like its
own machinery: so much material wrought up, so much fuel
consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.&nbsp; But,
less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its
varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and
made the only stand that ever <i>was</i> made in the place
against its direful uniformity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa is becoming,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
&lsquo;almost a young woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Time, with his innumerable horse-power, worked away, not
minding what anybody said, and presently turned out young Thomas
a foot taller than when his father had last taken particular
notice of him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thomas is becoming,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
&lsquo;almost a young man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Time passed Thomas on in the mill, while his father was
thinking about it, and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a
stiff shirt-collar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;the period
has arrived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Time, sticking to him, passed him on into Bounderby&rsquo;s
Bank, made him an inmate of Bounderby&rsquo;s house, necessitated
the purchase of his first razor, and exercised him diligently in
his calculations relative to number one.</p>
<p>The same great manufacturer, always with an immense variety of
work on hand, in every stage of development, passed Sissy onward
in his mill, and worked her up into a very pretty article
indeed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear, Jupe,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;that
your continuance at the school any longer would be
useless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid it would, sir,&rsquo; Sissy answered with a
curtsey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot disguise from you, Jupe,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind, knitting his brow, &lsquo;that the result of your
probation there has disappointed me; has greatly disappointed
me.&nbsp; You have not acquired, under Mr. and Mrs.
M&rsquo;Choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact
knowledge which I looked for.&nbsp; You are extremely deficient
in your facts.&nbsp; Your acquaintance with figures is very
limited.&nbsp; You are altogether backward, and below the
mark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry, sir,&rsquo; she returned; &lsquo;but I know
it is quite true.&nbsp; Yet I have tried hard, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;yes, I believe
you have tried hard; I have observed you, and I can find no fault
in that respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir.&nbsp; I have thought sometimes;&rsquo;
Sissy very timid here; &lsquo;that perhaps I tried to learn too
much, and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less,
I might have&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Jupe, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, shaking his
head in his profoundest and most eminently practical way.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No.&nbsp; The course you pursued, you pursued according to
the system&mdash;the system&mdash;and there is no more to be said
about it.&nbsp; I can only suppose that the circumstances of your
early life were too unfavourable to the development of your
reasoning powers, and that we began too late.&nbsp; Still, as I
have said already, I am disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment, sir,
of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon
you, and of your protection of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shed tears,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shed tears.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t complain of you.&nbsp; You are an affectionate,
earnest, good young woman&mdash;and&mdash;and we must make that
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir, very much,&rsquo; said Sissy, with a
grateful curtsey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally
pervading way) you are serviceable in the family also; so I
understand from Miss Louisa, and, indeed, so I have observed
myself.&nbsp; I therefore hope,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
&lsquo;that you can make yourself happy in those
relations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have nothing to wish, sir,
if&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand you,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind; &lsquo;you
still refer to your father.&nbsp; I have heard from Miss Louisa
that you still preserve that bottle.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; If your
training in the science of arriving at exact results had been
more successful, you would have been wiser on these points.&nbsp;
I will say no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her;
otherwise he held her calculating powers in such very slight
estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion.&nbsp;
Somehow or other, he had become possessed by an idea that there
was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a
tabular form.&nbsp; Her capacity of definition might be easily
stated at a very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at
nothing; yet he was not sure that if he had been required, for
example, to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return,
he would have quite known how to divide her.</p>
<p>In some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the
processes of Time are very rapid.&nbsp; Young Thomas and Sissy
being both at such a stage of their working up, these changes
were effected in a year or two; while Mr. Gradgrind himself
seemed stationary in his course, and underwent no alteration.</p>
<p>Except one, which was apart from his necessary progress
through the mill.&nbsp; Time hustled him into a little noisy and
rather dirty machinery, in a by-comer, and made him Member of
Parliament for Coketown: one of the respected members for ounce
weights and measures, one of the representatives of the
multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable gentlemen, dumb
honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame honourable
gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other
consideration.&nbsp; Else wherefore live we in a Christian land,
eighteen hundred and odd years after our Master?</p>
<p>All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and
reserved, and so much given to watching the bright ashes at
twilight as they fell into the grate, and became extinct, that
from the period when her father had said she was almost a young
woman&mdash;which seemed but yesterday&mdash;she had scarcely
attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young
woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite a young woman,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
musing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Soon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than
usual for several days, and seemed much engrossed by one
subject.&nbsp; On a certain night, when he was going out, and
Louisa came to bid him good-bye before his departure&mdash;as he
was not to be home until late and she would not see him again
until the morning&mdash;he held her in his arms, looking at her
in his kindest manner, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Louisa, you are a woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night
when she was found at the Circus; then cast down her eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;I must speak
with you alone and seriously.&nbsp; Come to me in my room after
breakfast to-morrow, will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your hands are rather cold, Louisa.&nbsp; Are you not
well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite well, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And cheerful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him again, and smiled in her peculiar
manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am as cheerful, father, as I usually am,
or usually have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; So,
he kissed her and went away; and Louisa returned to the serene
apartment of the hair-cutting character, and leaning her elbow on
her hand, looked again at the short-lived sparks that so soon
subsided into ashes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you there, Loo?&rsquo; said her brother, looking in
at the door.&nbsp; He was quite a young gentleman of pleasure
now, and not quite a prepossessing one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Tom,&rsquo; she answered, rising and embracing
him, &lsquo;how long it is since you have been to see
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I have been otherwise engaged, Loo, in the
evenings; and in the daytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at
it rather.&nbsp; But I touch him up with you when he comes it too
strong, and so we preserve an understanding.&nbsp; I say!&nbsp;
Has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday,
Loo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Tom.&nbsp; But he told me to-night that he wished
to do so in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I mean,&rsquo; said
Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know where he is
to-night?&rsquo;&mdash;with a very deep expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s with old
Bounderby.&nbsp; They are having a regular confab together up at
the Bank.&nbsp; Why at the Bank, do you think?&nbsp; Well,
I&rsquo;ll tell you again.&nbsp; To keep Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s
ears as far off as possible, I expect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With her hand upon her brother&rsquo;s shoulder, Louisa still
stood looking at the fire.&nbsp; Her brother glanced at her face
with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with
his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&lsquo;You are very fond of me, an&rsquo;t you,
Loo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals
go by without coming to see me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sister of mine,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;when you
say that, you are near my thoughts.&nbsp; We might be so much
oftener together&mdash;mightn&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; Always together,
almost&mdash;mightn&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; It would do me a great deal
of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what,
Loo.&nbsp; It would be a splendid thing for me.&nbsp; It would be
uncommonly jolly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny.&nbsp; He
could make nothing of her face.&nbsp; He pressed her in his arm,
and kissed her cheek.&nbsp; She returned the kiss, but still
looked at the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, Loo!&nbsp; I thought I&rsquo;d come, and just
hint to you what was going on: though I supposed you&rsquo;d most
likely guess, even if you didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
stay, because I&rsquo;m engaged to some fellows to-night.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t forget how fond you are of me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear Tom, I won&rsquo;t forget.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a capital girl,&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good-bye, Loo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave him an affectionate good-night, and went out with him
to the door, whence the fires of Coketown could be seen, making
the distance lurid.&nbsp; She stood there, looking steadfastly
towards them, and listening to his departing steps.&nbsp; They
retreated quickly, as glad to get away from Stone Lodge; and she
stood there yet, when he was gone and all was quiet.&nbsp; It
seemed as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in
the fiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of woof
Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all,
would weave from the threads he had already spun into a
woman.&nbsp; But his factory is a secret place, his work is
noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FATHER AND DAUGHTER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Mr. Gradgrind did not take
after Blue Beard, his room was quite a blue chamber in its
abundance of blue books.&nbsp; Whatever they could prove (which
is usually anything you like), they proved there, in an army
constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits.&nbsp; In
that charmed apartment, the most complicated social questions
were cast up, got into exact totals, and finally settled&mdash;if
those concerned could only have been brought to know it.&nbsp; As
if an astronomical observatory should be made without any
windows, and the astronomer within should arrange the starry
universe solely by pen, ink, and paper, so Mr. Gradgrind, in
<i>his</i> Observatory (and there are many like it), had no need
to cast an eye upon the teeming myriads of human beings around
him, but could settle all their destinies on a slate, and wipe
out all their tears with one dirty little bit of sponge.</p>
<p>To this Observatory, then: a stern room, with a deadly
statistical clock in it, which measured every second with a beat
like a rap upon a coffin-lid; Louisa repaired on the appointed
morning.&nbsp; A window looked towards Coketown; and when she sat
down near her father&rsquo;s table, she saw the high chimneys and
the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy distance
gloomily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Louisa,&rsquo; said her father, &lsquo;I
prepared you last night to give me your serious attention in the
conversation we are now going to have together.&nbsp; You have
been so well trained, and you do, I am happy to say, so much
justice to the education you have received, that I have perfect
confidence in your good sense.&nbsp; You are not impulsive, you
are not romantic, you are accustomed to view everything from the
strong dispassionate ground of reason and calculation.&nbsp; From
that ground alone, I know you will view and consider what I am
going to communicate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He waited, as if he would have been glad that she said
something.&nbsp; But she said never a word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of
marriage that has been made to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again he waited, and again she answered not one word.&nbsp;
This so far surprised him, as to induce him gently to repeat,
&lsquo;a proposal of marriage, my dear.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which she
returned, without any visible emotion whatever:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hear you, father.&nbsp; I am attending, I assure
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, breaking into a smile,
after being for the moment at a loss, &lsquo;you are even more
dispassionate than I expected, Louisa.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, you are
not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to
make?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot say that, father, until I hear it.&nbsp;
Prepared or unprepared, I wish to hear it all from you.&nbsp; I
wish to hear you state it to me, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Strange to relate, Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this
moment as his daughter was.&nbsp; He took a paper-knife in his
hand, turned it over, laid it down, took it up again, and even
then had to look along the blade of it, considering how to go
on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you say, my dear Louisa, is perfectly
reasonable.&nbsp; I have undertaken then to let you know
that&mdash;in short, that Mr. Bounderby has informed me that he
has long watched your progress with particular interest and
pleasure, and has long hoped that the time might ultimately
arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage.&nbsp; That
time, to which he has so long, and certainly with great
constancy, looked forward, is now come.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby has
made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make
it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it
into your favourable consideration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Silence between them.&nbsp; The deadly statistical clock very
hollow.&nbsp; The distant smoke very black and heavy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said Louisa, &lsquo;do you think I love
Mr. Bounderby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected
question.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, my child,&rsquo; he returned,
&lsquo;I&mdash;really&mdash;cannot take upon myself to
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice
as before, &lsquo;do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Louisa, no.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I ask
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she still pursued, &lsquo;does Mr.
Bounderby ask me to love him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;it
is difficult to answer your question&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, my dear.&nbsp; Because;&rsquo; here was
something to demonstrate, and it set him up again; &lsquo;because
the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in which we
use the expression.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do you the
injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending
to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (I am using synonymous terms)
sentimental.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up
under his eyes, to very little purpose, if he could so far forget
what is due to your good sense, not to say to his, as to address
you from any such ground.&nbsp; Therefore, perhaps the expression
itself&mdash;I merely suggest this to you, my dear&mdash;may be a
little misplaced.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would you advise me to use in its stead,
father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, my dear Louisa,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
completely recovered by this time, &lsquo;I would advise you
(since you ask me) to consider this question, as you have been
accustomed to consider every other question, simply as one of
tangible Fact.&nbsp; The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass
such subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that
have no existence, properly viewed&mdash;really no
existence&mdash;but it is no compliment to you to say, that you
know better.&nbsp; Now, what are the Facts of this case?&nbsp;
You are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr.
Bounderby is, we will say in round numbers, fifty.&nbsp; There is
some disparity in your respective years, but in your means and
positions there is none; on the contrary, there is a great
suitability.&nbsp; Then the question arises, Is this one
disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a
marriage?&nbsp; In considering this question, it is not
unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage, so
far as they have yet been obtained, in England and Wales.&nbsp; I
find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion of
these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal
ages, and that the elder of these contracting parties is, in
rather more than three-fourths of these instances, the
bridegroom.&nbsp; It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence
of this law, that among the natives of the British possessions in
India, also in a considerable part of China, and among the
Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet furnished
us by travellers, yield similar results.&nbsp; The disparity I
have mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and
(virtually) all but disappears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you recommend, father,&rsquo; asked Louisa, her
reserved composure not in the least affected by these gratifying
results, &lsquo;that I should substitute for the term I used just
now?&nbsp; For the misplaced expression?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa,&rsquo; returned her father, &lsquo;it appears
to me that nothing can be plainer.&nbsp; Confining yourself
rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is:
Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him?&nbsp; Yes, he does.&nbsp;
The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him?&nbsp; I
think nothing can be plainer than that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I marry him?&rsquo; repeated Louisa, with great
deliberation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Precisely.&nbsp; And it is satisfactory to me, as your
father, my dear Louisa, to know that you do not come to the
consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind,
and habits of life, that belong to many young women.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, father,&rsquo; she returned, &lsquo;I do
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I now leave you to judge for yourself,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have stated the case, as such cases are
usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it, as the
case of your mother and myself was stated in its time.&nbsp; The
rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly.&nbsp;
As he now leaned back in his chair, and bent his deep-set eyes
upon her in his turn, perhaps he might have seen one wavering
moment in her, when she was impelled to throw herself upon his
breast, and give him the pent-up confidences of her heart.&nbsp;
But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a bound the artificial
barriers he had for many years been erecting, between himself and
all those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the utmost
cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be sounded
shall blow even algebra to wreck.&nbsp; The barriers were too
many and too high for such a leap.&nbsp; With his unbending,
utilitarian, matter-of-fact face, he hardened her again; and the
moment shot away into the plumbless depths of the past, to mingle
with all the lost opportunities that are drowned there.</p>
<p>Removing her eyes from him, she sat so long looking silently
towards the town, that he said, at length: &lsquo;Are you
consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works, Louisa?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There seems to be nothing there but languid and
monotonous smoke.&nbsp; Yet when the night comes, Fire bursts
out, father!&rsquo; she answered, turning quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I know that, Louisa.&nbsp; I do not see the
application of the remark.&rsquo;&nbsp; To do him justice he did
not, at all.</p>
<p>She passed it away with a slight motion of her hand, and
concentrating her attention upon him again, said, &lsquo;Father,
I have often thought that life is very short.&rsquo;&mdash;This
was so distinctly one of his subjects that he interposed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is short, no doubt, my dear.&nbsp; Still, the
average duration of human life is proved to have increased of
late years.&nbsp; The calculations of various life assurance and
annuity offices, among other figures which cannot go wrong, have
established the fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I speak of my own life, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O indeed?&nbsp; Still,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
&lsquo;I need not point out to you, Louisa, that it is governed
by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can,
and the little I am fit for.&nbsp; What does it
matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last
four words; replying, &lsquo;How, matter?&nbsp; What matter, my
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby,&rsquo; she went on in a steady, straight
way, without regarding this, &lsquo;asks me to marry him.&nbsp;
The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him?&nbsp;
That is so, father, is it not?&nbsp; You have told me so,
father.&nbsp; Have you not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be so.&nbsp; Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take
me thus, I am satisfied to accept his proposal.&nbsp; Tell him,
father, as soon as you please, that this was my answer.&nbsp;
Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I should wish him
to know what I said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quite right, my dear,&rsquo; retorted her father
approvingly, &lsquo;to be exact.&nbsp; I will observe your very
proper request.&nbsp; Have you any wish in reference to the
period of your marriage, my child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None, father.&nbsp; What does it matter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and
taken her hand.&nbsp; But, her repetition of these words seemed
to strike with some little discord on his ear.&nbsp; He paused to
look at her, and, still holding her hand, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you
one question, because the possibility implied in it appeared to
me to be too remote.&nbsp; But perhaps I ought to do so.&nbsp;
You have never entertained in secret any other
proposal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she returned, almost scornfully,
&lsquo;what other proposal can have been made to <i>me</i>?&nbsp;
Whom have I seen?&nbsp; Where have I been?&nbsp; What are my
heart&rsquo;s experiences?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Louisa,&rsquo; returned Mr. Gradgrind,
reassured and satisfied.&nbsp; &lsquo;You correct me
justly.&nbsp; I merely wished to discharge my duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do <i>I</i> know, father,&rsquo; said Louisa in
her quiet manner, &lsquo;of tastes and fancies; of aspirations
and affections; of all that part of my nature in which such light
things might have been nourished?&nbsp; What escape have I had
from problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that
could be grasped?&rsquo;&nbsp; As she said it, she unconsciously
closed her hand, as if upon a solid object, and slowly opened it
as though she were releasing dust or ash.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; assented her eminently practical
parent, &lsquo;quite true, quite true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, father,&rsquo; she pursued, &lsquo;what a strange
question to ask <i>me</i>!&nbsp; The baby-preference that even I
have heard of as common among children, has never had its
innocent resting-place in my breast.&nbsp; You have been so
careful of me, that I never had a child&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; You
have trained me so well, that I never dreamed a child&rsquo;s
dream.&nbsp; You have dealt so wisely with me, father, from my
cradle to this hour, that I never had a child&rsquo;s belief or a
child&rsquo;s fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his success, and by this
testimony to it.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear Louisa,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;you abundantly repay my care.&nbsp; Kiss me, my dear
girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, his daughter kissed him.&nbsp; Detaining her in his
embrace, he said, &lsquo;I may assure you now, my favourite
child, that I am made happy by the sound decision at which you
have arrived.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man; and
what little disparity can be said to exist between you&mdash;if
any&mdash;is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has
acquired.&nbsp; It has always been my object so to educate you,
as that you might, while still in your early youth, be (if I may
so express myself) almost any age.&nbsp; Kiss me once more,
Louisa.&nbsp; Now, let us go and find your mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the
esteemed lady with no nonsense about her, was recumbent as usual,
while Sissy worked beside her.&nbsp; She gave some feeble signs
of returning animation when they entered, and presently the faint
transparency was presented in a sitting attitude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Gradgrind,&rsquo; said her husband, who had waited
for the achievement of this feat with some impatience,
&lsquo;allow me to present to you Mrs. Bounderby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mrs. Gradgrind, &lsquo;so you have
settled it!&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m sure I hope your health may be
good, Louisa; for if your head begins to split as soon as you are
married, which was the case with mine, I cannot consider that you
are to be envied, though I have no doubt you think you are, as
all girls do.&nbsp; However, I give you <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>joy, my
dear&mdash;and I hope you may now turn all your ological studies
to good account, I am sure I do!&nbsp; I must give you a kiss of
congratulation, Louisa; but don&rsquo;t touch my right shoulder,
for there&rsquo;s something running down it all day long.&nbsp;
And now you see,&rsquo; whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, adjusting her
shawls after the affectionate ceremony, &lsquo;I shall be
worrying myself, morning, noon, and night, to know what I am to
call him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Gradgrind,&rsquo; said her husband, solemnly,
&lsquo;what do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever I am to call him, Mr. Gradgrind, when he is
married to Louisa!&nbsp; I must call him something.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s impossible,&rsquo; said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a mingled
sense of politeness and injury, &lsquo;to be constantly
addressing him and never giving him a name.&nbsp; I cannot call
him Josiah, for the name is insupportable to me.&nbsp; You
yourself wouldn&rsquo;t hear of Joe, you very well know.&nbsp; Am
I to call my own son-in-law, Mister!&nbsp; Not, I believe, unless
the time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled
upon by my relations.&nbsp; Then, what am I to call
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the
remarkable emergency, Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the
time being, after delivering the following codicil to her remarks
already executed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is,&mdash;and I
ask it with a fluttering in my chest, which actually extends to
the soles of my feet,&mdash;that it may take place soon.&nbsp;
Otherwise, I know it is one of those subjects I shall never hear
the last of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby, Sissy had
suddenly turned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in
sorrow, in doubt, in a multitude of emotions, towards
Louisa.&nbsp; Louisa had known it, and seen it, without looking
at her.&nbsp; From that moment she was impassive, proud and
cold&mdash;held Sissy at a distance&mdash;changed to her
altogether.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HUSBAND AND WIFE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s</span> first
disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was occasioned by the
necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; He could not
make up his mind how to do that, or what the consequences of the
step might be.&nbsp; Whether she would instantly depart, bag and
baggage, to Lady Scadgers, or would positively refuse to budge
from the premises; whether she would be plaintive or abusive,
tearful or tearing; whether she would break her heart, or break
the looking-glass; Mr. Bounderby could not all foresee.&nbsp;
However, as it must be done, he had no choice but to do it; so,
after attempting several letters, and failing in them all, he
resolved to do it by word of mouth.</p>
<p>On his way home, on the evening he set aside for this
momentous purpose, he took the precaution of stepping into a
chemist&rsquo;s shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest
smelling-salts.&nbsp; &lsquo;By George!&rsquo; said Mr.
Bounderby, &lsquo;if she takes it in the fainting way, I&rsquo;ll
have the skin off her nose, at all events!&rsquo;&nbsp; But, in
spite of being thus forearmed, he entered his own house with
anything but a courageous air; and appeared before the object of
his misgivings, like a dog who was conscious of coming direct
from the pantry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good evening, Mr. Bounderby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good evening, ma&rsquo;am, good evening.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He drew up his chair, and Mrs. Sparsit drew back hers, as who
should say, &lsquo;Your fireside, sir.&nbsp; I freely admit
it.&nbsp; It is for you to occupy it all, if you think
proper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go to the North Pole, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo;
said Mr. Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned,
though short of her former position.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her, as, with the points of a
stiff, sharp pair of scissors, she picked out holes for some
inscrutable ornamental purpose, in a piece of cambric.&nbsp; An
operation which, taken in connexion with the bushy eyebrows and
the Roman nose, suggested with some liveliness the idea of a hawk
engaged upon the eyes of a tough little bird.&nbsp; She was so
steadfastly occupied, that many minutes elapsed before she looked
up from her work; when she did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her
attention with a hitch of his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
putting his hands in his pockets, and assuring himself with his
right hand that the cork of the little bottle was ready for use,
&lsquo;I have no occasion to say to you, that you are not only a
lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; returned the lady, &lsquo;this is indeed
not the first time that you have honoured me with similar
expressions of your good opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;I am going to astonish you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir?&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit,
interrogatively, and in the most tranquil manner possible.&nbsp;
She generally wore mittens, and she now laid down her work, and
smoothed those mittens.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;to marry Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
hope you may be happy, Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; Oh, indeed I hope you
may be happy, sir!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she said it with such great
condescension as well as with such great compassion for him, that
Bounderby,&mdash;far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her
workbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug,&mdash;corked
up the smelling-salts tight in his pocket, and thought,
&lsquo;Now confound this woman, who could have even guessed that
she would take it in this way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish with all my heart, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, in a highly superior manner; somehow she seemed, in a
moment, to have established a right to pity him ever afterwards;
&lsquo;that you may be in all respects very happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; returned Bounderby, with some
resentment in his tone: which was clearly lowered, though in
spite of himself, &lsquo;I am obliged to you.&nbsp; I hope I
shall be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Do</i> you, sir!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, with
great affability.&nbsp; &lsquo;But naturally you do; of course
you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s part,
succeeded.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her work and
occasionally gave a small cough, which sounded like the cough of
conscious strength and forbearance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; resumed Bounderby,
&lsquo;under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be
agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you
would be very welcome here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of
that!&rsquo; Mrs. Sparsit shook her head, still in her highly
superior manner, and a little changed the small
cough&mdash;coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose
within her, but had better be coughed down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;there are apartments at the Bank, where a born and bred
lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than
otherwise; and if the same terms&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir.&nbsp; You were so good as to
promise that you would always substitute the phrase, annual
compliment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, annual compliment.&nbsp; If the same
annual compliment would be acceptable there, why, I see nothing
to part us, unless you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
proposal is like yourself, and if the position I shall assume at
the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in
the social scale&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course it is,&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If it was not, ma&rsquo;am, you don&rsquo;t suppose that I
should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have
moved in.&nbsp; Not that <i>I</i> care for such society, you
know!&nbsp; But <i>you</i> do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have your own private apartments, and
you&rsquo;ll have your coals and your candles, and all the rest
of it, and you&rsquo;ll have your maid to attend upon you, and
you&rsquo;ll have your light porter to protect you, and
you&rsquo;ll be what I take the liberty of considering precious
comfortable,&rsquo; said Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;say no
more.&nbsp; In yielding up my trust here, I shall not be freed
from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence:&rsquo; she
might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate article in a
savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: &lsquo;and I would
rather receive it from your hand, than from any other.&nbsp;
Therefore, sir, I accept your offer gratefully, and with many
sincere acknowledgments for past favours.&nbsp; And I hope,
sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, concluding in an impressively
compassionate manner, &lsquo;I fondly hope that Miss Gradgrind
may be all you desire, and deserve!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more.&nbsp;
It was in vain for Bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in
any of his explosive ways; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have
compassion on him, as a Victim.&nbsp; She was polite, obliging,
cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the more obliging, the
more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary altogether,
she; the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim, he.&nbsp; She had that
tenderness for his melancholy fate, that his great red
countenance used to break out into cold perspirations when she
looked at him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight
weeks&rsquo; time, and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone
Lodge as an accepted wooer.&nbsp; Love was made on these
occasions in the form of bracelets; and, on all occasions during
the period of betrothal, took a manufacturing aspect.&nbsp;
Dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were
made, settlements were made, and an extensive assortment of Facts
did appropriate honour to the contract.&nbsp; The business was
all Fact, from first to last.&nbsp; The Hours did not go through
any of those rosy performances, which foolish poets have ascribed
to them at such times; neither did the clocks go any faster, or
any slower, than at other seasons.&nbsp; The deadly statistical
recorder in the Gradgrind observatory knocked every second on the
head as it was born, and buried it with his accustomed
regularity.</p>
<p>So the day came, as all other days come to people who will
only stick to reason; and when it came, there were married in the
church of the florid wooden legs&mdash;that popular order of
architecture&mdash;Josiah Bounderby Esquire of Coketown, to
Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas Gradgrind Esquire of Stone
Lodge, M.P. for that borough.&nbsp; And when they were united in
holy matrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge
aforesaid.</p>
<p>There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious
occasion, who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was
made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what
quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and
all about it.&nbsp; The bridesmaids, down to little Jane
Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit helpmates
for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of
the company.</p>
<p>After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the
following terms:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of
Coketown.&nbsp; Since you have done my wife and myself the honour
of drinking our healths and happiness, I suppose I must
acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and know what I
am, and what my extraction was, you won&rsquo;t expect a speech
from a man who, when he sees a Post, says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
Post,&rdquo; and when he sees a Pump, says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
Pump,&rdquo; and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump, or a
Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick.&nbsp; If you want a
speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind,
is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it.&nbsp; I
am not your man.&nbsp; However, if I feel a little independent
when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I
thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter when I was a
ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a
pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be
excused.&nbsp; So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you
don&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; I <i>do</i> feel
independent.&nbsp; Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned,
that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; I am very glad to be so.&nbsp; It has long been
my wish to be so.&nbsp; I have watched her bringing-up, and I
believe she is worthy of me.&nbsp; At the same time&mdash;not to
deceive you&mdash;I believe I am worthy of her.&nbsp; So, I thank
you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards
us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the
present company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good
a wife as I have found.&nbsp; And I hope every spinster may find
as good a husband as my wife has found.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after which oration, as they were going on a nuptial
trip to Lyons, in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the
opportunity of seeing how the Hands got on in those parts, and
whether they, too, required to be fed with gold spoons; the happy
pair departed for the railroad.&nbsp; The bride, in passing
down-stairs, dressed for her journey, found Tom waiting for
her&mdash;flushed, either with his feelings, or the vinous part
of the breakfast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate
sister, Loo!&rsquo; whispered Tom.</p>
<p>She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better
nature that day, and was a little shaken in her reserved
composure for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old Bounderby&rsquo;s quite ready,&rsquo; said
Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Time&rsquo;s up.&nbsp; Good-bye!&nbsp; I shall
be on the look-out for you, when you come back.&nbsp; I say, my
dear Loo!&nbsp; <span class="smcap">An&rsquo;t</span> it
uncommonly jolly now!&rsquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EFFECTS IN THE BANK</span></h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">sunny</span> midsummer day.&nbsp; There
was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown.</p>
<p>Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in
a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun&rsquo;s
rays.&nbsp; You only knew the town was there, because you knew
there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect
without a town.&nbsp; A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly
tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of
Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose
and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with
sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of
darkness:&mdash;Coketown in the distance was suggestive of
itself, though not a brick of it could be seen.</p>
<p>The wonder was, it was there at all.&nbsp; It had been ruined
so often, that it was amazing how it had borne so many
shocks.&nbsp; Surely there never was such fragile china-ware as
that of which the millers of Coketown were made.&nbsp; Handle
them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with such ease
that you might suspect them of having been flawed before.&nbsp;
They were ruined, when they were required to send labouring
children to school; they were ruined when inspectors were
appointed to look into their works; they were ruined, when such
inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite
justified in chopping people up with their machinery; they were
utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not
always make quite so much smoke.&nbsp; Besides Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s gold spoon which was generally received in
Coketown, another prevalent fiction was very popular there.&nbsp;
It took the form of a threat.&nbsp; Whenever a Coketowner felt he
was ill-used&mdash;that is to say, whenever he was not left
entirely alone, and it was proposed to hold him accountable for
the consequences of any of his acts&mdash;he was sure to come out
with the awful menace, that he would &lsquo;sooner pitch his
property into the Atlantic.&rsquo;&nbsp; This had terrified the
Home Secretary within an inch of his life, on several
occasions.</p>
<p>However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that
they never had pitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but,
on the contrary, had been kind enough to take mighty good care of
it.&nbsp; So there it was, in the haze yonder; and it increased
and multiplied.</p>
<p>The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun
was so bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour
drooping over Coketown, and could not be looked at
steadily.&nbsp; Stokers emerged from low underground doorways
into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and palings,
wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals.&nbsp; The
whole town seemed to be frying in oil.&nbsp; There was a stifling
smell of hot oil everywhere.&nbsp; The steam-engines shone with
it, the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it, the mills
throughout their many stories oozed and trickled it.&nbsp; The
atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the
simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled
languidly in the desert.&nbsp; But no temperature made the
melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane.&nbsp; Their
wearisome heads went up and down at the same rate, in hot weather
and cold, wet weather and dry, fair weather and foul.&nbsp; The
measured motion of their shadows on the walls, was the substitute
Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods; while,
for the summer hum of insects, it could offer, all the year
round, from the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the
whirr of shafts and wheels.</p>
<p>Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny day, making the
passenger more sleepy and more hot as he passed the humming walls
of the mills.&nbsp; Sun-blinds, and sprinklings of water, a
little cooled the main streets and the shops; but the mills, and
the courts and alleys, baked at a fierce heat.&nbsp; Down upon
the river that was black and thick with dye, some Coketown boys
who were at large&mdash;a rare sight there&mdash;rowed a crazy
boat, which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged
along, while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells.&nbsp;
But the sun itself, however beneficent, generally, was less kind
to Coketown than hard frost, and rarely looked intently into any
of its closer regions without engendering more death than
life.&nbsp; So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil eye,
when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the
things it looks upon to bless.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank, on
the shadier side of the frying street.&nbsp; Office-hours were
over: and at that period of the day, in warm weather, she usually
embellished with her genteel presence, a managerial board-room
over the public office.&nbsp; Her own private sitting-room was a
story higher, at the window of which post of observation she was
ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he came across
the road, with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a
Victim.&nbsp; He had been married now a year; and Mrs. Sparsit
had never released him from her determined pity a moment.</p>
<p>The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the
town.&nbsp; It was another red brick house, with black outside
shutters, green inside blinds, a black street-door up two white
steps, a brazen door-plate, and a brazen door-handle full
stop.&nbsp; It was a size larger than Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s
house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes
smaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to
pattern.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide
among the desks and writing implements, she shed a feminine, not
to say also aristocratic, grace upon the office.&nbsp; Seated,
with her needlework or netting apparatus, at the window, she had
a self-laudatory sense of correcting, by her ladylike deportment,
the rude business aspect of the place.&nbsp; With this impression
of her interesting character upon her, Mrs. Sparsit considered
herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy.&nbsp; The townspeople who,
in their passing and repassing, saw her there, regarded her as
the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.</p>
<p>What those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they
did.&nbsp; Gold and silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if
divulged would bring vague destruction upon vague persons
(generally, however, people whom she disliked), were the chief
items in her ideal catalogue thereof.&nbsp; For the rest, she
knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the
office furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three
locks, against the door of which strong chamber the light porter
laid his head every night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared at
cockcrow.&nbsp; Further, she was lady paramount over certain
vaults in the basement, sharply spiked off from communication
with the predatory world; and over the relics of the current
day&rsquo;s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out pens,
fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that
nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs.
Sparsit tried.&nbsp; Lastly, she was guardian over a little
armoury of cutlasses and carbines, arrayed in vengeful order
above one of the official chimney-pieces; and over that
respectable tradition never to be separated from a place of
business claiming to be wealthy&mdash;a row of
fire-buckets&mdash;vessels calculated to be of no physical
utility on any occasion, but observed to exercise a fine moral
influence, almost equal to bullion, on most beholders.</p>
<p>A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs.
Sparsit&rsquo;s empire.&nbsp; The deaf serving-woman was rumoured
to be wealthy; and a saying had for years gone about among the
lower orders of Coketown, that she would be murdered some night
when the Bank was shut, for the sake of her money.&nbsp; It was
generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some time,
and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and
her situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned
much offence and disappointment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s tea was just set for her on a pert little
table, with its tripod of legs in an attitude, which she
insinuated after office-hours, into the company of the stern,
leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode the middle of the
room.&nbsp; The light porter placed the tea-tray on it, knuckling
his forehead as a form of homage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Bitzer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank <i>you</i>, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; returned the
light porter.&nbsp; He was a very light porter indeed; as light
as in the days when he blinkingly defined a horse, for girl
number twenty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All is shut up, Bitzer?&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All is shut up, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her
tea, &lsquo;is the news of the day?&nbsp; Anything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I can&rsquo;t say that I have heard
anything particular.&nbsp; Our people are a bad lot, ma&rsquo;am;
but that is no news, unfortunately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are the restless wretches doing now?&rsquo; asked
Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merely going on in the old way, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is much to be regretted,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit,
making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in
the strength of her severity, &lsquo;that the united masters
allow of any such class-combinations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bitzer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set
their faces against employing any man who is united with any
other man,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have done that, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; returned
Bitzer; &lsquo;but it rather fell through,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not pretend to understand these things,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, &lsquo;my lot having been
signally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit, as a
Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any such
dissensions.&nbsp; I only know that these people must be
conquered, and that it&rsquo;s high time it was done, once for
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; returned Bitzer, with a
demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s oracular
authority.&nbsp; &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t put it clearer, I am
sure, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential
chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and
seen that she was going to ask him something, he made a pretence
of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady
went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into
the street.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a very busy day, my lady.&nbsp; About an average
day.&rsquo;&nbsp; He now and then slided into my lady, instead of
ma&rsquo;am, as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs.
Sparsit&rsquo;s personal dignity and claims to reverence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clerks,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully
brushing an imperceptible crumb of bread and butter from her
left-hand mitten, &lsquo;are trustworthy, punctual, and
industrious, of course?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, pretty fair, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; With
the usual exception.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He held the respectable office of general spy and informer in
the establishment, for which volunteer service he received a
present at Christmas, over and above his weekly wage.&nbsp; He
had grown into an extremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young
man, who was safe to rise in the world.&nbsp; His mind was so
exactly regulated, that he had no affections or passions.&nbsp;
All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest
calculation; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit
habitually observed of him, that he was a young man of the
steadiest principle she had ever known.&nbsp; Having satisfied
himself, on his father&rsquo;s death, that his mother had a right
of settlement in Coketown, this excellent young economist had
asserted that right for her with such a steadfast adherence to
the principle of the case, that she had been shut up in the
workhouse ever since.&nbsp; It must be admitted that he allowed
her half a pound of tea a year, which was weak in him: first,
because all gifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the
recipient, and secondly, because his only reasonable transaction
in that commodity would have been to buy it for as little as he
could possibly give, and sell it for as much as he could possibly
get; it having been clearly ascertained by philosophers that in
this is comprised the whole duty of man&mdash;not a part of
man&rsquo;s duty, but the whole.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty fair, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; With the usual
exception, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; repeated Bitzer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head
over her tea-cup, and taking a long gulp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Thomas, ma&rsquo;am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much,
ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t like his ways at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bitzer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive
manner, &lsquo;do you recollect my having said anything to you
respecting names?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite
true that you did object to names being used, and they&rsquo;re
always best avoided.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please to remember that I have a charge here,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Sparsit, with her air of state.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hold a
trust here, Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; However improbable
both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago,
that he would ever become my patron, making me an annual
compliment, I cannot but regard him in that light.&nbsp; From Mr.
Bounderby I have received every acknowledgment of my social
station, and every recognition of my family descent, that I could
possibly expect.&nbsp; More, far more.&nbsp; Therefore, to my
patron I will be scrupulously true.&nbsp; And I do not consider,
I will not consider, I cannot consider,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit,
with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality,
&lsquo;that I <i>should</i> be scrupulously true, if I allowed
names to be mentioned under this roof, that are
unfortunately&mdash;most unfortunately&mdash;no doubt of
that&mdash;connected with his.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged
pardon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Bitzer,&rsquo; continued Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;say
an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must
excuse me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With the usual exception, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bitzer, trying back, &lsquo;of an individual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit repeated the
ejaculation, the shake of the head over her tea-cup, and the long
gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it
had been interrupted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An individual, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bitzer,
&lsquo;has never been what he ought to have been, since he first
came into the place.&nbsp; He is a dissipated, extravagant
idler.&nbsp; He is not worth his salt, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; He
wouldn&rsquo;t get it either, if he hadn&rsquo;t a friend and
relation at court, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, with another
melancholy shake of her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only hope, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; pursued Bitzer,
&lsquo;that his friend and relation may not supply him with the
means of carrying on.&nbsp; Otherwise, ma&rsquo;am, we know out
of whose pocket <i>that</i> money comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with
another melancholy shake of her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is to be pitied, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; The last party I
have alluded to, is to be pitied, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bitzer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Bitzer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have always pitied the delusion, always.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to an individual, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bitzer,
dropping his voice and drawing nearer, &lsquo;he is as
improvident as any of the people in this town.&nbsp; And you know
what <i>their</i> improvidence is, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; No one
could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence
does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They would do well,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit,
&lsquo;to take example by you, Bitzer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; But, since you do refer
to me, now look at me, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I have put by a little,
ma&rsquo;am, already.&nbsp; That gratuity which I receive at
Christmas, ma&rsquo;am: I never touch it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
even go the length of my wages, though they&rsquo;re not high,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t they do as I have done,
ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; What one person can do, another can
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This, again, was among the fictions of Coketown.&nbsp; Any
capitalist there, who had made sixty thousand pounds out of
sixpence, always professed to wonder why the sixty thousand
nearest Hands didn&rsquo;t each make sixty thousand pounds out of
sixpence, and more or less reproached them every one for not
accomplishing the little feat.&nbsp; What I did you can do.&nbsp;
Why don&rsquo;t you go and do it?</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to their wanting recreations, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
said Bitzer, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s stuff and nonsense.&nbsp; <i>I</i>
don&rsquo;t want recreations.&nbsp; I never did, and I never
shall; I don&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em.&nbsp; As to their combining
together; there are many of them, I have no doubt, that by
watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now
and then, whether in money or good will, and improve their
livelihood.&nbsp; Then, why don&rsquo;t they improve it,
ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the first consideration of a
rational creature, and it&rsquo;s what they pretend to
want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretend indeed!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma&rsquo;am, till
it becomes quite nauseous, concerning their wives and
families,&rsquo; said Bitzer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why look at me,
ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want a wife and family.&nbsp;
Why should they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they are improvident,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; returned Bitzer,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s where it is.&nbsp; If they were more
provident and less perverse, ma&rsquo;am, what would they
do?&nbsp; They would say, &ldquo;While my hat covers my
family,&rdquo; or &ldquo;while my bonnet covers my
family,&rdquo;&mdash;as the case might be,
ma&rsquo;am&mdash;&ldquo;I have only one to feed, and
that&rsquo;s the person I most like to feed.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating
muffin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bitzer, knuckling
his forehead again, in return for the favour of Mrs.
Sparsit&rsquo;s improving conversation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would you
wish a little more hot water, ma&rsquo;am, or is there anything
else that I could fetch you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing just now, Bitzer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wish to
disturb you at your meals, ma&rsquo;am, particularly tea, knowing
your partiality for it,&rsquo; said Bitzer, craning a little to
look over into the street from where he stood; &lsquo;but
there&rsquo;s a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or
so, ma&rsquo;am, and he has come across as if he was going to
knock.&nbsp; That <i>is</i> his knock, ma&rsquo;am, no
doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his
head again, confirmed himself with, &lsquo;Yes,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who it can be,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A stranger, ma&rsquo;am, evidently.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of
the evening, unless he comes upon some business for which he is
too late, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit,
&lsquo;but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr.
Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it.&nbsp; If to see him
is any part of the duty I have accepted, I will see him.&nbsp;
Use your own discretion, Bitzer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s
magnanimous words, repeated his knock so loudly that the light
porter hastened down to open the door; while Mrs. Sparsit took
the precaution of concealing her little table, with all its
appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and then decamped up-stairs,
that she might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, ma&rsquo;am, the gentleman would wish to
see you,&rsquo; said Bitzer, with his light eye at Mrs.
Sparsit&rsquo;s keyhole.&nbsp; So, Mrs. Sparsit, who had improved
the interval by touching up her cap, took her classical features
down-stairs again, and entered the board-room in the manner of a
Roman matron going outside the city walls to treat with an
invading general.</p>
<p>The visitor having strolled to the window, and being then
engaged in looking carelessly out, was as unmoved by this
impressive entry as man could possibly be.&nbsp; He stood
whistling to himself with all imaginable coolness, with his hat
still on, and a certain air of exhaustion upon him, in part
arising from excessive summer, and in part from excessive
gentility.&nbsp; For it was to be seen with half an eye that he
was a thorough gentleman, made to the model of the time; weary of
everything, and putting no more faith in anything than
Lucifer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe, sir,&rsquo; quoth Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;you
wished to see me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he said, turning and removing
his hat; &lsquo;pray excuse me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; thought Mrs. Sparsit, as she made a
stately bend.&nbsp; &lsquo;Five and thirty, good-looking, good
figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding, well-dressed, dark
hair, bold eyes.&rsquo;&nbsp; All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in
her womanly way&mdash;like the Sultan who put his head in the
pail of water&mdash;merely in dipping down and coming up
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please to be seated, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; Allow me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He placed a
chair for her, but remained himself carelessly lounging against
the table.&nbsp; &lsquo;I left my servant at the railway looking
after the luggage&mdash;very heavy train and vast quantity of it
in the van&mdash;and strolled on, looking about me.&nbsp;
Exceedingly odd place.&nbsp; Will you allow me to ask you if
it&rsquo;s <i>always</i> as black as this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In general much blacker,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit,
in her uncompromising way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it possible!&nbsp; Excuse me: you are not a native,
I think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was once my good or ill fortune, as it may be&mdash;before I
became a widow&mdash;to move in a very different sphere.&nbsp; My
husband was a Powler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg your pardon, really!&rsquo; said the
stranger.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit repeated, &lsquo;A Powler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Powler Family,&rsquo; said the stranger, after
reflecting a few moments.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit signified
assent.&nbsp; The stranger seemed a little more fatigued than
before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be very much bored here?&rsquo; was the
inference he drew from the communication.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the servant of circumstances, sir,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;and I have long adapted myself to the
governing power of my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very philosophical,&rsquo; returned the stranger,
&lsquo;and very exemplary and laudable, and&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
It seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the sentence,
so he played with his watch-chain wearily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I be permitted to ask, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, &lsquo;to what I am indebted for the favour
of&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Assuredly,&rsquo; said the stranger.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much
obliged to you for reminding me.&nbsp; I am the bearer of a
letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby, the banker.&nbsp;
Walking through this extraordinarily black town, while they were
getting dinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom I met;
one of the working people; who appeared to have been taking a
shower-bath of something fluffy, which I assume to be the raw
material&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit inclined her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;Raw material&mdash;where Mr. Bounderby, the
banker, might reside.&nbsp; Upon which, misled no doubt by the
word Banker, he directed me to the Bank.&nbsp; Fact being, I
presume, that Mr. Bounderby the Banker does <i>not</i> reside in
the edifice in which I have the honour of offering this
explanation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;he does
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I had no intention of delivering my
letter at the present moment, nor have I. But strolling on to the
Bank to kill time, and having the good fortune to observe at the
window,&rsquo; towards which he languidly waved his hand, then
slightly bowed, &lsquo;a lady of a very superior and agreeable
appearance, I considered that I could not do better than take the
liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker
<i>does</i> live.&nbsp; Which I accordingly venture, with all
suitable apologies, to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently
relieved, to Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s thinking, by a certain
gallantry at ease, which offered her homage too.&nbsp; Here he
was, for instance, at this moment, all but sitting on the table,
and yet lazily bending over her, as if he acknowledged an
attraction in her that made her charming&mdash;in her way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Banks, I know, are always suspicious, and officially
must be,&rsquo; said the stranger, whose lightness and smoothness
of speech were pleasant likewise; suggesting matter far more
sensible and humorous than it ever contained&mdash;which was
perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this numerous sect,
whosoever may have been that great man: &lsquo;therefore I may
observe that my letter&mdash;here it is&mdash;is from the member
for this place&mdash;Gradgrind&mdash;whom I have had the pleasure
of knowing in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such
confirmation was quite unnecessary, and gave Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s address, with all needful clues and directions
in aid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thousand thanks,&rsquo; said the stranger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Of course you know the Banker well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
my dependent relation towards him, I have known him ten
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite an eternity!&nbsp; I think he married
Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her
mouth, &lsquo;he had that&mdash;honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Is</i> she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse my impertinent curiosity,&rsquo; pursued the
stranger, fluttering over Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s eyebrows, with a
propitiatory air, &lsquo;but you know the family, and know the
world.&nbsp; I am about to know the family, and may have much to
do with them.&nbsp; Is the lady so very alarming?&nbsp; Her
father gives her such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that
I have a burning desire to know.&nbsp; Is she absolutely
unapproachable?&nbsp; Repellently and stunningly clever?&nbsp; I
see, by your meaning smile, you think not.&nbsp; You have poured
balm into my anxious soul.&nbsp; As to age, now.&nbsp;
Forty?&nbsp; Five and thirty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright.&nbsp; &lsquo;A chit,&rsquo;
said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not twenty when she was
married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,&rsquo; returned the
stranger, detaching himself from the table, &lsquo;that I never
was so astonished in my life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent of his
capacity of being impressed.&nbsp; He looked at his informant for
full a quarter of a minute, and appeared to have the surprise in
his mind all the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;I assure you, Mrs.
Powler,&rsquo; he then said, much exhausted, &lsquo;that the
father&rsquo;s manner prepared me for a grim and stony
maturity.&nbsp; I am obliged to you, of all things, for
correcting so absurd a mistake.&nbsp; Pray excuse my
intrusion.&nbsp; Many thanks.&nbsp; Good day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in the window
curtain, saw him languishing down the street on the shady side of
the way, observed of all the town.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&lsquo;What do you think of the gentleman,
Bitzer?&rsquo; she asked the light porter, when he came to take
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spends a deal of money on his dress,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be admitted,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit,
&lsquo;that it&rsquo;s very tasteful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; returned Bitzer, &lsquo;if
that&rsquo;s worth the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides which, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; resumed Bitzer,
while he was polishing the table, &lsquo;he looks to me as if he
gamed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s immoral to game,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bitzer,
&lsquo;because the chances are against the players.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from
working, or whether it was that her hand was out, she did no work
that night.&nbsp; She sat at the window, when the sun began to
sink behind the smoke; she sat there, when the smoke was burning
red, when the colour faded from it, when darkness seemed to rise
slowly out of the ground, and creep upward, upward, up to the
house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of the
factory chimneys, up to the sky.&nbsp; Without a candle in the
room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her,
not thinking much of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys,
the barking of dogs, the rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices
of passengers, the shrill street cries, the clogs upon the
pavement when it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of
shop-shutters.&nbsp; Not until the light porter announced that
her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse
herself from her reverie, and convey her dense black
eyebrows&mdash;by that time creased with meditation, as if they
needed ironing out-up-stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, you Fool!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was
alone at her supper.&nbsp; Whom she meant, she did not say; but
she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Gradgrind party wanted
assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces.&nbsp; They went
about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits more
hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out
everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for
anything?</p>
<p>Moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime
height were attractive to many of the Gradgrind school.&nbsp;
They liked fine gentlemen; they pretended that they did not, but
they did.&nbsp; They became exhausted in imitation of them; and
they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they served out,
with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political
economy, on which they regaled their disciples.&nbsp; There never
before was seen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus
produced.</p>
<p>Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the
Gradgrind school, there was one of a good family and a better
appearance, with a happy turn of humour which had told immensely
with the House of Commons on the occasion of his entertaining it
with his (and the Board of Directors) view of a railway accident,
in which the most careful officers ever known, employed by the
most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by the finest
mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole in action on the
best line ever constructed, had killed five people and wounded
thirty-two, by a casualty without which the excellence of the
whole system would have been positively incomplete.&nbsp; Among
the slain was a cow, and among the scattered articles unowned, a
widow&rsquo;s cap.&nbsp; And the honourable member had so tickled
the House (which has a delicate sense of humour) by putting the
cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any serious reference
to the Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest, and brought the railway off with
Cheers and Laughter.</p>
<p>Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better
appearance than himself, who had tried life as a Cornet of
Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had afterwards tried it in the
train of an English minister abroad, and found it a bore; and had
then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored there; and had then
gone yachting about the world, and got bored everywhere.&nbsp; To
whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one
day, &lsquo;Jem, there&rsquo;s a good opening among the hard Fact
fellows, and they want men.&nbsp; I wonder you don&rsquo;t go in
for statistics.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jem, rather taken by the novelty of
the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to
&lsquo;go in&rsquo; for statistics as for anything else.&nbsp;
So, he went in.&nbsp; He coached himself up with a blue-book or
two; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows,
and said, &lsquo;If you want to bring in, for any place, a
handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech, look after
my brother Jem, for he&rsquo;s your man.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a few
dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of
political sages approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him
down to Coketown, to become known there and in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to
Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand;
superscribed, &lsquo;Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker,
Coketown.&nbsp; Specially to introduce James Harthouse,
Esquire.&nbsp; Thomas Gradgrind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James
Harthouse&rsquo;s card, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went
down to the Hotel.&nbsp; There he found Mr. James Harthouse
looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that
he was already half-disposed to &lsquo;go in&rsquo; for something
else.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name, sir,&rsquo; said his visitor, &lsquo;is Josiah
Bounderby, of Coketown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely
looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coketown, sir,&rsquo; said Bounderby, obstinately
taking a chair, &lsquo;is not the kind of place you have been
accustomed to.&nbsp; Therefore, if you will allow me&mdash;or
whether you will or not, for I am a plain man&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
tell you something about it before we go any further.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harthouse would be charmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rsquo; said
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t promise it.&nbsp; First of
all, you see our smoke.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s meat and drink to
us.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the healthiest thing in the world in all
respects, and particularly for the lungs.&nbsp; If you are one of
those who want us to consume it, I differ from you.&nbsp; We are
not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than
we wear &rsquo;em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in
Great Britain and Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By way of &lsquo;going in&rsquo; to the fullest extent, Mr.
Harthouse rejoined, &lsquo;Mr. Bounderby, I assure you I am
entirely and completely of your way of thinking.&nbsp; On
conviction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear it,&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our
mills, no doubt.&nbsp; You have?&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll state the fact of it to you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
pleasantest work there is, and it&rsquo;s the lightest work there
is, and it&rsquo;s the best-paid work there is.&nbsp; More than
that, we couldn&rsquo;t improve the mills themselves, unless we
laid down Turkey carpets on the floors.&nbsp; Which we&rsquo;re
not a-going to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lastly,&rsquo; said Bounderby, &lsquo;as to our
Hands.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a Hand in this town, sir, man,
woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life.&nbsp; That
object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold
spoon.&nbsp; Now, they&rsquo;re not a-going&mdash;none of
&rsquo;em&mdash;ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a
gold spoon.&nbsp; And now you know the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree
instructed and refreshed, by this condensed epitome of the whole
Coketown question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you see,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;it
suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man,
particularly with a public man, when I make his
acquaintance.&nbsp; I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr.
Harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall
respond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom
Gradgrind&rsquo;s letter of introduction.&nbsp; You are a man of
family.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you deceive yourself by supposing for a
moment that I am a man of family.&nbsp; I am a bit of dirty
riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag, and
bobtail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If anything could have exalted Jem&rsquo;s interest in Mr.
Bounderby, it would have been this very circumstance.&nbsp; Or,
so he told him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So now,&rsquo; said Bounderby, &lsquo;we may shake
hands on equal terms.&nbsp; I say, equal terms, because although
I know what I am, and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted
myself out of, better than any man does, I am as proud as you
are.&nbsp; I am just as proud as you are.&nbsp; Having now
asserted my independence in a proper manner, I may come to how do
you find yourself, and I hope you&rsquo;re pretty
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The better, Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as they shook
hands, for the salubrious air of Coketown.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby
received the answer with favour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you know,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;or perhaps you
don&rsquo;t know, I married Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me, I
shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s
daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby,&rsquo; said Jem, &lsquo;you anticipate
my dearest wishes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went out without further discourse; and Mr. Bounderby
piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him,
to the private red brick dwelling, with the black outside
shutters, the green inside blinds, and the black street door up
the two white steps.&nbsp; In the drawing-room of which mansion,
there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr.
James Harthouse had ever seen.&nbsp; She was so constrained, and
yet so careless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and
proud, and yet so sensitively ashamed of her husband&rsquo;s
braggart humility&mdash;from which she shrunk as if every example
of it were a cut or a blow; that it was quite a new sensation to
observe her.&nbsp; In face she was no less remarkable than in
manner.&nbsp; Her features were handsome; but their natural play
was so locked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their
genuine expression.&nbsp; Utterly indifferent, perfectly
self-reliant, never at a loss, and yet never at her ease, with
her figure in company with them there, and her mind apparently
quite alone&mdash;it was of no use &lsquo;going in&rsquo; yet
awhile to comprehend this girl, for she baffled all
penetration.</p>
<p>From the mistress of the house, the visitor glanced to the
house itself.&nbsp; There was no mute sign of a woman in the
room.&nbsp; No graceful little adornment, no fanciful little
device, however trivial, anywhere expressed her influence.&nbsp;
Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich, there
the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and
unrelieved by the least trace of any womanly occupation.&nbsp; As
Mr. Bounderby stood in the midst of his household gods, so those
unrelenting divinities occupied their places around Mr.
Bounderby, and they were worthy of one another, and well
matched.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This, sir,&rsquo; said Bounderby, &lsquo;is my wife,
Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s eldest daughter.&nbsp; Loo,
Mr. James Harthouse.&nbsp; Mr. Harthouse has joined your
father&rsquo;s muster-roll.&nbsp; If he is not Tom
Gradgrind&rsquo;s colleague before long, I believe we shall at
least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring
towns.&nbsp; You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my
junior.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what she saw in me to marry me,
but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn&rsquo;t
have married me.&nbsp; She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir,
political and otherwise.&nbsp; If you want to cram for anything,
I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than
Loo Bounderby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more
likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said his host.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you&rsquo;re in the complimentary line, you&rsquo;ll get on here,
for you&rsquo;ll meet with no competition.&nbsp; I have never
been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don&rsquo;t
profess to understand the art of paying &rsquo;em.&nbsp; In fact,
despise &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But, your bringing-up was different from
mine; mine was a real thing, by George!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a
gentleman, and I don&rsquo;t pretend to be one.&nbsp; I am Josiah
Bounderby of Coketown, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.&nbsp;
However, though I am not influenced by manners and station, Loo
Bounderby may be.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t my
advantages&mdash;disadvantages you would call &rsquo;em, but I
call &rsquo;em advantages&mdash;so you&rsquo;ll not waste your
power, I dare say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby,&rsquo; said Jem, turning with a smile to
Louisa, &lsquo;is a noble animal in a comparatively natural
state, quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack
like myself works.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,&rsquo; she quietly
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is natural that you should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen
so much of the world, and thought, &lsquo;Now, how am I to take
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what
Mr. Bounderby has said, to the service of your country.&nbsp; You
have made up your mind,&rsquo; said Louisa, still standing before
him where she had first stopped&mdash;in all the singular
contrariety of her self-possession, and her being obviously very
ill at ease&mdash;&lsquo;to show the nation the way out of all
its difficulties.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby,&rsquo; he returned, laughing,
&lsquo;upon my honour, no.&nbsp; I will make no such pretence to
you.&nbsp; I have seen a little, here and there, up and down; I
have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and as
some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in for
your respected father&rsquo;s opinions&mdash;really because I
have no choice of opinions, and may as well back them as anything
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you none of your own?&rsquo; asked Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not so much as the slightest predilection
left.&nbsp; I assure you I attach not the least importance to any
opinions.&nbsp; The result of the varieties of boredom I have
undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction is too industrious
a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject), that
any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set, and
just as much harm as any other set.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an
English family with a charming Italian motto.&nbsp; What will be,
will be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only truth going!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty&mdash;a vice
so dangerous, so deadly, and so common&mdash;seemed, he observed,
a little to impress her in his favour.&nbsp; He followed up the
advantage, by saying in his pleasantest manner: a manner to which
she might attach as much or as little meaning as she pleased:
&lsquo;The side that can prove anything in a line of units, tens,
hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford
the most fun, and to give a man the best chance.&nbsp; I am quite
as much attached to it as if I believed it.&nbsp; I am quite
ready to go in for it, to the same extent as if I believed
it.&nbsp; And what more could I possibly do, if I did believe
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a singular politician,&rsquo; said Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me; I have not even that merit.&nbsp; We are the
largest party in the state, I assure you, Mrs. Bounderby, if we
all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence,
interposed here with a project for postponing the family dinner
till half-past six, and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the
meantime on a round of visits to the voting and interesting
notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity.&nbsp; The round of
visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of
his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a
considerable accession of boredom.</p>
<p>In the evening, he found the dinner-table laid for four, but
they sat down only three.&nbsp; It was an appropriate occasion
for Mr. Bounderby to discuss the flavour of the hap&rsquo;orth of
stewed eels he had purchased in the streets at eight years old;
and also of the inferior water, specially used for laying the
dust, with which he had washed down that repast.&nbsp; He
likewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the
calculation that he (Bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least
three horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.&nbsp;
These recitals, Jem, in a languid manner, received with
&lsquo;charming!&rsquo; every now and then; and they probably
would have decided him to &lsquo;go in&rsquo; for Jerusalem again
to-morrow morning, had he been less curious respecting
Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there nothing,&rsquo; he thought, glancing at her as
she sat at the head of the table, where her youthful figure,
small and slight, but <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>very graceful, looked as pretty as
it looked misplaced; &lsquo;is there nothing that will move that
face?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes!&nbsp; By Jupiter, there was something, and here it was,
in an unexpected shape.&nbsp; Tom appeared.&nbsp; She changed as
the door opened, and broke into a beaming smile.</p>
<p>A beautiful smile.&nbsp; Mr. James Harthouse might not have
thought so much of it, but that he had wondered so long at her
impassive face.&nbsp; She put out her hand&mdash;a pretty little
soft hand; and her fingers closed upon her brother&rsquo;s, as if
she would have carried them to her lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay?&rsquo; thought the visitor.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
whelp is the only creature she cares for.&nbsp; So,
so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whelp was presented, and took his chair.&nbsp; The
appellation was not flattering, but not unmerited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I was your age, young Tom,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;I was punctual, or I got no dinner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you were my age,&rsquo; resumed Tom, &lsquo;you
hadn&rsquo;t a wrong balance to get right, and hadn&rsquo;t to
dress afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that now,&rsquo; said Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; grumbled Tom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t begin with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby,&rsquo; said Harthouse, perfectly
hearing this under-strain as it went on; &lsquo;your
brother&rsquo;s face is quite familiar to me.&nbsp; Can I have
seen him abroad?&nbsp; Or at some public school,
perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she resumed, quite interested, &lsquo;he has
never been abroad yet, and was educated here, at home.&nbsp; Tom,
love, I am telling Mr. Harthouse that he never saw you
abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No such luck, sir,&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>There was little enough in him to brighten her face, for he
was a sullen young fellow, and ungracious in his manner even to
her.&nbsp; So much the greater must have been the solitude of her
heart, and her need of some one on whom to bestow it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So much the more is this whelp the only creature she has
ever cared for,&rsquo; thought Mr. James Harthouse, turning it
over and over.&nbsp; &lsquo;So much the more.&nbsp; So much the
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Both in his sister&rsquo;s presence, and after she had left
the room, the whelp took no pains to hide his contempt for Mr.
Bounderby, whenever he could indulge it without the observation
of that independent man, by making wry faces, or shutting one
eye.&nbsp; Without responding to these telegraphic
communications, Mr. Harthouse encouraged him much in the course
of the evening, and showed an unusual liking for him.&nbsp; At
last, when he rose to return to his hotel, and was a little
doubtful whether he knew the way by night, the whelp immediately
proffered his services as guide, and turned out with him to
escort him thither.</p>

101</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WHELP</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was very remarkable that a young
gentleman who had been brought up under one continuous system of
unnatural restraint, should be a hypocrite; but it was certainly
the case with Tom.&nbsp; It was very strange that a young
gentleman who had never been left to his own guidance for five
consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing
himself; but so it was with Tom.&nbsp; It was altogether
unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been
strangled in his cradle, should be still inconvenienced by its
ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities; but such a monster,
beyond all doubt, was Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you smoke?&rsquo; asked Mr. James Harthouse, when
they came to the hotel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you!&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>He could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less
than go up.&nbsp; What with a cooling drink adapted to the
weather, but not so weak as cool; and what with a rarer tobacco
than was to be bought in those parts; Tom was soon in a highly
free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and more than ever
disposed to admire his new friend at the other end.</p>
<p>Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little
while, and took an observation of his friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
don&rsquo;t seem to care about his dress,&rsquo; thought Tom,
&lsquo;and yet how capitally he does it.&nbsp; What an easy swell
he is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom&rsquo;s eye,
remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own
negligent hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have
had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Tom said
this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass
knowingly, at his entertainer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very good fellow indeed!&rsquo; returned Mr. James
Harthouse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think so, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp;
And shut up his eye again.</p>
<p>Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the
sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so
that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front
of Tom and looking down at him, observed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a comical brother-in-law you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think
you mean,&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a piece of caustic, Tom,&rsquo; retorted Mr.
James Harthouse.</p>
<p>There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate
with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate
way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon,
with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased
with himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care for old Bounderby,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;if you mean that.&nbsp; I have always called old
Bounderby by the same name when I have talked about him, and I
have always thought of him in the same way.&nbsp; I am not going
to begin to be polite now, about old Bounderby.&nbsp; It would be
rather late in the day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me,&rsquo; returned James; &lsquo;but
take care when his wife is by, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His wife?&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;My sister
Loo?&nbsp; O yes!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he laughed, and took a little
more of the cooling drink.</p>
<p>James Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and
attitude, smoking his cigar in his own easy way, and looking
pleasantly at the whelp, as if he knew himself to be a kind of
agreeable demon who had only to hover over him, and he must give
up his whole soul if required.&nbsp; It certainly did seem that
the whelp yielded to this influence.&nbsp; He looked at his
companion sneakingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at
him boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sister Loo?&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>She</i>
never cared for old Bounderby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the past tense, Tom,&rsquo; returned Mr.
James Harthouse, striking the ash from his cigar with his little
finger.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are in the present tense, now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Verb neuter, not to care.&nbsp; Indicative mood,
present tense.&nbsp; First person singular, I do not care; second
person singular, thou dost not care; third person singular, she
does not care,&rsquo; returned Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&nbsp; Very quaint!&rsquo; said his friend.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Though you don&rsquo;t mean it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I <i>do</i> mean it,&rsquo; cried Tom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Upon my honour!&nbsp; Why, you won&rsquo;t tell me, Mr.
Harthouse, that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for
old Bounderby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;what
am I bound to suppose, when I find two married people living in
harmony and happiness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa.&nbsp; If
his second leg had not been already there when he was called a
dear fellow, he would have put it up at that great stage of the
conversation.&nbsp; Feeling it necessary to do something then, he
stretched himself out at greater length, and, reclining with the
back of his head on the end of the sofa, and smoking with an
infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common face, and
not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so
carelessly yet so potently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,&rsquo; said Tom,
&lsquo;and therefore, you needn&rsquo;t be surprised that Loo
married old Bounderby.&nbsp; She never had a lover, and the
governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very dutiful in your interesting sister,&rsquo; said
Mr. James Harthouse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but she wouldn&rsquo;t have been as dutiful, and
it would not have come off as easily,&rsquo; returned the whelp,
&lsquo;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was
obliged to go on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> persuaded her,&rsquo; he said, with an
edifying air of superiority.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was stuck into old
Bounderby&rsquo;s bank (where I never wanted to be), and I knew I
should get into scrapes there, if she put old Bounderby&rsquo;s
pipe out; so I told her my wishes, and she came into them.&nbsp;
She would do anything for me.&nbsp; It was very game of her,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was charming, Tom!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that it was altogether so important to her as it
was to me,&rsquo; continued Tom coolly, &lsquo;because my liberty
and comfort, and perhaps my getting on, depended on it; and she
had no other lover, and staying at home was like staying in
jail&mdash;especially when I was gone.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t as
if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby; but still it was
a good thing in her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly delightful.&nbsp; And she gets on so
placidly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; returned Tom, with contemptuous patronage,
&lsquo;she&rsquo;s a regular girl.&nbsp; A girl can get on
anywhere.&nbsp; She has settled down to the life, and <i>she</i>
don&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; It does just as well as another.&nbsp;
Besides, though Loo is a girl, she&rsquo;s not a common sort of
girl.&nbsp; She can shut herself up within herself, and
think&mdash;as I have often known her sit and watch the
fire&mdash;for an hour at a stretch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay?&nbsp; Has resources of her own,&rsquo; said
Harthouse, smoking quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so much of that as you may suppose,&rsquo; returned
Tom; &lsquo;for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of
dry bones and sawdust.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s his system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Formed his daughter on his own model?&rsquo; suggested
Harthouse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His daughter?&nbsp; Ah! and everybody else.&nbsp; Why,
he formed Me that way!&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did, though,&rsquo; said Tom, shaking his
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mean to say, Mr. Harthouse, that when I
first left home and went to old Bounderby&rsquo;s, I was as flat
as a warming-pan, and knew no more about life, than any oyster
does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Tom!&nbsp; I can hardly believe that.&nbsp; A
joke&rsquo;s a joke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my soul!&rsquo; said the whelp.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
serious; I am indeed!&rsquo;&nbsp; He smoked with great gravity
and dignity for a little while, and then added, in a highly
complacent tone, &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I have picked up a little
since.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t deny that.&nbsp; But I have done it
myself; no thanks to the governor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your intelligent sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My intelligent sister is about where she was.&nbsp; She
used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon,
that girls usually fall back upon; and I don&rsquo;t see how she
is to have got over that since.&nbsp; But <i>she</i> don&rsquo;t
mind,&rsquo; he sagaciously added, puffing at his cigar
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Girls can always get on, somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Calling at the Bank yesterday evening, for Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s address, I found an ancient lady there, who
seems to entertain great admiration for your sister,&rsquo;
observed Mr. James Harthouse, throwing away the last small
remnant of the cigar he had now smoked out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother Sparsit!&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;What! you
have seen her already, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His friend nodded.&nbsp; Tom took his cigar out of his mouth,
to shut up his eye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the
greater expression, and to tap his nose several times with his
finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother Sparsit&rsquo;s feeling for Loo is more than
admiration, I should think,&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Say
affection and devotion.&nbsp; Mother Sparsit never set her cap at
Bounderby when he was a bachelor.&nbsp; Oh no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>These were the last words spoken by the whelp, before a giddy
drowsiness came upon him, followed by complete oblivion.&nbsp; He
was roused from the latter state by an uneasy dream of being
stirred up with a boot, and also of a voice saying: &lsquo;Come,
it&rsquo;s late.&nbsp; Be off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said, scrambling from the sofa.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I must take my leave of you though.&nbsp; I say.&nbsp;
Yours is very good tobacco.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s too
mild.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s too mild,&rsquo; returned his
entertainer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s ridiculously mild,&rsquo;
said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the door!&nbsp; Good
night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter
through a mist, which, after giving him some trouble and
difficulty, resolved itself into the main street, in which he
stood alone.&nbsp; He then walked home pretty easily, though not
yet free from an impression of the presence and influence of his
new friend&mdash;as if he were lounging somewhere in the air, in
the same negligent attitude, regarding him with the same
look.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>The
whelp went home, and went to bed.&nbsp; If he had had any sense
of what he had done that night, and had been less of a whelp and
more of a brother, he might have turned short on the road, might
have gone down to the ill-smelling river that was dyed black,
might have gone to bed in it for good and all, and have curtained
his head for ever with its filthy waters.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MEN AND BROTHERS</span></h3>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, my friends, the
down-trodden operatives of Coketown!&nbsp; Oh, my friends and
fellow-countrymen, the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding
despotism!&nbsp; Oh, my friends and fellow-sufferers, and
fellow-workmen, and fellow-men!&nbsp; I tell you that the hour is
come, when we must rally round one another as One united power,
and crumble into dust the oppressors that too long have battened
upon the plunder of our families, upon the sweat of our brows,
upon the labour of our hands, upon the strength of our sinews,
upon the God-created glorious rights of Humanity, and upon the
holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hear, hear,
hear!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; and other cries, arose
in many voices from various parts of the densely crowded and
suffocatingly close Hall, in which the orator, perched on a
stage, delivered himself of this and what other froth and fume he
had in him.&nbsp; He had declaimed himself into a violent heat,
and was as hoarse as he was hot.&nbsp; By dint of roaring at the
top of his voice under a flaring gaslight, clenching his fists,
knitting his brows, setting his teeth, and pounding with his
arms, he had taken so much out of himself by this time, that he
was brought to a stop, and called for a glass of water.</p>
<p>As he stood there, trying to quench his fiery face with his
drink of water, the comparison between the orator and the crowd
of attentive faces turned towards him, was extremely to his
disadvantage.&nbsp; Judging him by Nature&rsquo;s evidence, he
was above the mass in very little but the stage on which he
stood.&nbsp; In many great respects he was essentially below
them.&nbsp; He was not so honest, he was not so manly, he was not
so good-humoured; he substituted cunning for their simplicity,
and passion for their safe solid sense.&nbsp; An ill-made,
high-shouldered man, with lowering brows, and his features
crushed into an habitually sour expression, he contrasted most
unfavourably, even in his mongrel dress, with the great body of
his hearers in their plain working clothes.&nbsp; Strange as it
always is to consider any assembly in the act of submissively
resigning itself to the dreariness of some complacent person,
lord or commoner, whom three-fourths of it could, by no human
means, raise out of the slough of inanity to their own
intellectual level, it was particularly strange, and it was even
particularly affecting, to see this crowd of earnest faces, whose
honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could
doubt, so agitated by such a leader.</p>
<p>Good!&nbsp; Hear, hear!&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; The eagerness both
of attention and intention, exhibited in all the countenances,
made them a most impressive sight.&nbsp; There was no
carelessness, no languor, no idle curiosity; none of the many
shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies,
visible for one moment there.&nbsp; That every man felt his
condition to be, somehow or other, worse than it might be; that
every man considered it incumbent on him to join the rest,
towards the making of it better; that every man felt his only
hope to be in his allying himself to the comrades by whom he was
surrounded; and that in this belief, right or wrong (unhappily
wrong then), the whole of that crowd were gravely, deeply,
faithfully in earnest; must have been as plain to any one who
chose to see what was there, as the bare beams of the roof and
the whitened brick walls.&nbsp; Nor could any such spectator fail
to know in his own breast, that these men, through their very
delusions, showed great qualities, susceptible of being turned to
the happiest and best account; and that to pretend (on the
strength of sweeping axioms, howsoever cut and dried) that they
went astray wholly without cause, and of their own irrational
wills, was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire,
death without birth, harvest without seed, anything or everything
produced from nothing.</p>
<p>The orator having refreshed himself, wiped his corrugated
forehead from left to right several times with his handkerchief
folded into a pad, and concentrated all his revived forces, in a
sneer of great disdain and bitterness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But oh, my friends and brothers!&nbsp; Oh, men and
Englishmen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown!&nbsp; What
shall we say of that man&mdash;that working-man, that I should
find it necessary so to libel the glorious name&mdash;who, being
practically and well acquainted with the grievances and wrongs of
you, the injured pith and marrow of this land, and having heard
you, with a noble and majestic unanimity that will make Tyrants
tremble, resolve for to subscribe to the funds of the United
Aggregate Tribunal, and to abide by the injunctions issued by
that body for your benefit, whatever they may be&mdash;what, I
ask you, will you say of that working-man, since such I must
acknowledge him to be, who, at such a time, deserts his post, and
sells his flag; who, at such a time, turns a traitor and a craven
and a recreant, who, at such a time, is not ashamed to make to
you the dastardly and humiliating avowal that he will hold
himself aloof, and will <i>not</i> be one of those associated in
the gallant stand for Freedom and for Right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The assembly was divided at this point.&nbsp; There were some
groans and hisses, but the general sense of honour was much too
strong for the condemnation of a man unheard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be
sure you&rsquo;re right, Slackbridge!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Put him
up!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s hear him!&rsquo;&nbsp; Such
things were said on many sides.&nbsp; Finally, one strong voice
called out, &lsquo;Is the man heer?&nbsp; If the man&rsquo;s
heer, Slackbridge, let&rsquo;s hear the man himseln, &rsquo;stead
o&rsquo; yo.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which was received with a round of
applause.</p>
<p>Slackbridge, the orator, looked about him with a withering
smile; and, holding out his right hand at arm&rsquo;s length (as
the manner of all Slackbridges is), to still the thundering sea,
waited until there was a profound silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my friends and fellow-men!&rsquo; said Slackbridge
then, shaking his head with violent scorn, &lsquo;I do not wonder
that you, the prostrate sons of labour, are incredulous of the
existence of such a man.&nbsp; But he who sold his birthright for
a mess of pottage existed, and Judas Iscariot existed, and
Castlereagh existed, and this man exists!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here, a brief press and confusion near the stage, ended in the
man himself standing at the orator&rsquo;s side before the
concourse.&nbsp; He was pale and a little moved in the
face&mdash;his lips especially showed it; but he stood quiet,
with his left hand at his chin, waiting to be heard.&nbsp; There
was a chairman to regulate the proceedings, and this functionary
now took the case into his own hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;by virtue o&rsquo;
my office as your president, I askes o&rsquo; our friend
Slackbridge, who may be a little over hetter in this business, to
take his seat, whiles this man Stephen Blackpool is heern.&nbsp;
You all know this man Stephen Blackpool.&nbsp; You know him
awlung o&rsquo; his misfort&rsquo;ns, and his good
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that, the chairman shook him frankly by the hand, and sat
down again.&nbsp; Slackbridge likewise sat down, wiping his hot
forehead&mdash;always from left to right, and never the reverse
way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; Stephen began, in the midst of a
dead calm; &lsquo;I ha&rsquo; hed what&rsquo;s been spok&rsquo;n
o&rsquo; me, and &rsquo;tis lickly that I shan&rsquo;t mend
it.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d liefer you&rsquo;d hearn the truth
concernin myseln, fro my lips than fro onny other man&rsquo;s,
though I never cud&rsquo;n speak afore so monny, wi&rsquo;out
bein moydert and muddled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Slackbridge shook his head as if he would shake it off, in his
bitterness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m th&rsquo; one single Hand in
Bounderby&rsquo;s mill, o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the men theer, as
don&rsquo;t coom in wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; proposed
reg&rsquo;lations.&nbsp; I canna coom in wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; My friends, I doubt their doin&rsquo; yo onny
good.&nbsp; Licker they&rsquo;ll do yo hurt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Slackbridge laughed, folded his arms, and frowned
sarcastically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But &rsquo;t an&rsquo;t sommuch for that as I stands
out.&nbsp; If that were aw, I&rsquo;d coom in wi&rsquo; th&rsquo;
rest.&nbsp; But I ha&rsquo; my reasons&mdash;mine, yo
see&mdash;for being hindered; not on&rsquo;y now, but
awlus&mdash;awlus&mdash;life long!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Slackbridge jumped up and stood beside him, gnashing and
tearing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, my friends, what but this did I tell
you?&nbsp; Oh, my fellow-countrymen, what warning but this did I
give you?&nbsp; And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on
whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy?&nbsp; Oh, you
Englishmen, I ask you how does this subornation show in one of
yourselves, who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to
yours, and to your children&rsquo;s and your children&rsquo;s
children&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was some applause, and some crying of Shame upon the
man; but the greater part of the audience were quiet.&nbsp; They
looked at Stephen&rsquo;s worn face, rendered more pathetic by
the homely emotions it evinced; and, in the kindness of their
nature, they were more sorry than indignant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis this Delegate&rsquo;s trade for t&rsquo;
speak,&rsquo; said Stephen, &lsquo;an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s paid for
&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; he knows his work.&nbsp; Let him keep to
&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Let him give no heed to what I ha had&rsquo;n to
bear.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not for him.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not for
nobbody but me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a propriety, not to say a dignity in these words,
that made the hearers yet more quiet and attentive.&nbsp; The
same strong voice called out, &lsquo;Slackbridge, let the man be
heern, and howd thee tongue!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the place was
wonderfully still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brothers,&rsquo; said Stephen, whose low voice was
distinctly heard, &lsquo;and my fellow-workmen&mdash;for that yo
are to me, though not, as I knows on, to this delegate
here&mdash;I ha but a word to sen, and I could sen nommore if I
was to speak till Strike o&rsquo; day.&nbsp; I know weel, aw
what&rsquo;s afore me.&nbsp; I know weel that yo aw resolve to ha
nommore ado wi&rsquo; a man who is not wi&rsquo; yo in this
matther.&nbsp; I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; road, yo&rsquo;d feel it right to pass me by, as a
forrenner and stranger.&nbsp; What I ha getn, I mun mak th&rsquo;
best on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen Blackpool,&rsquo; said the chairman, rising,
&lsquo;think on &rsquo;t agen.&nbsp; Think on &rsquo;t once agen,
lad, afore thou&rsquo;rt shunned by aw owd friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was an universal murmur to the same effect, though no
man articulated a word.&nbsp; Every eye was fixed on
Stephen&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; To repent of his determination, would
be to take a load from all their minds.&nbsp; He looked around
him, and knew that it was so.&nbsp; Not a grain of anger with
them was in his heart; he knew them, far below their surface
weaknesses and misconceptions, as no one but their
fellow-labourer could.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha thowt on &rsquo;t, above a bit, sir.&nbsp; I
simply canna coom in.&nbsp; I mun go th&rsquo; way as lays afore
me.&nbsp; I mun tak my leave o&rsquo; aw heer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made a sort of reverence to them by holding up his arms,
and stood for the moment in that attitude; not speaking until
they slowly dropped at his sides.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monny&rsquo;s the pleasant word as soom heer has
spok&rsquo;n wi&rsquo; me; monny&rsquo;s the face I see heer, as
I first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart&rsquo;n than
now.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; never had no fratch afore, sin ever I were
born, wi&rsquo; any o&rsquo; my like; Gonnows I ha&rsquo; none
now that&rsquo;s o&rsquo; my makin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo;ll
ca&rsquo; me traitor and that&mdash;yo I mean t&rsquo;
say,&rsquo; addressing Slackbridge, &lsquo;but &rsquo;tis easier
to ca&rsquo; than mak&rsquo; out.&nbsp; So let be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had moved away a pace or two to come down from the
platform, when he remembered something he had not said, and
returned again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haply,&rsquo; he said, turning his furrowed face slowly
about, that he might as it were individually address the whole
audience, those both near and distant; &lsquo;haply, when this
question has been tak&rsquo;n up and discoosed, there&rsquo;ll be
a threat to turn out if I&rsquo;m let to work among yo.&nbsp; I
hope I shall die ere ever such a time cooms, and I shall work
solitary among yo unless it cooms&mdash;truly, I mun do &rsquo;t,
my friends; not to brave yo, but to live.&nbsp; I ha nobbut work
to live by; and wheerever can I go, I who ha worked sin I were no
heighth at aw, in Coketown heer?&nbsp; I mak&rsquo; no complaints
o&rsquo; bein turned to the wa&rsquo;, o&rsquo; bein outcasten
and overlooken fro this time forrard, but hope I shall be let to
work.&nbsp; If there is any right for me at aw, my friends, I
think &rsquo;tis that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken.&nbsp; Not a sound was audible in the
building, but the slight rustle of men moving a little apart, all
along the centre of the room, to open a means of passing out, to
the man with whom they had all bound themselves to renounce
companionship.&nbsp; Looking at no one, and going his way with a
lowly steadiness upon him that asserted nothing and sought
nothing, Old Stephen, with all his troubles on his head, left the
scene.</p>
<p>Then Slackbridge, who had kept his oratorical arm extended
during the going out, as if he were repressing with infinite
solicitude and by a wonderful moral power the vehement passions
of the multitude, applied himself to raising their spirits.&nbsp;
Had not the Roman Brutus, oh, my British countrymen, condemned
his son to death; and had not the Spartan mothers, oh my soon to
be victorious friends, driven their flying children on the points
of their enemies&rsquo; swords?&nbsp; Then was it not the sacred
duty of the men of Coketown, with forefathers before them, an
admiring world in company with them, and a posterity to come
after them, to hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched
in a sacred and a God-like cause?&nbsp; The winds of heaven
answered Yes; and bore Yes, east, west, north, and south.&nbsp;
And consequently three cheers for the United Aggregate
Tribunal!</p>
<p>Slackbridge acted as fugleman, and gave the time.&nbsp; The
multitude of doubtful faces (a little conscience-stricken)
brightened at the sound, and took it up.&nbsp; Private feeling
must yield to the common cause.&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; The roof yet
vibrated with the cheering, when the assembly dispersed.</p>
<p>Thus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the loneliest of
lives, the life of solitude among a familiar crowd.&nbsp; The
stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand faces for some
answering look and never finds it, is in cheering society as
compared with him who passes ten averted faces daily, that were
once the countenances of friends.&nbsp; Such experience was to be
Stephen&rsquo;s now, in every waking moment of his life; at his
work, on his way to it and from it, at his door, at his window,
everywhere.&nbsp; By general consent, they even avoided that side
of the street on which he habitually walked; and left it, of all
the working men, to him only.</p>
<p>He had been for many years, a quiet silent man, associating
but little with other men, and used to companionship with his own
thoughts.&nbsp; He had never known before the strength of the
want in his heart for the frequent recognition of a nod, a look,
a word; or the immense amount of relief that had been poured into
it by drops through such small means.&nbsp; It was even harder
than he could have believed possible, to separate in his own
conscience his abandonment by all his fellows from a baseless
sense of shame and disgrace.</p>
<p>The first four days of his endurance were days so long and
heavy, that he began to be appalled by the prospect before
him.&nbsp; Not only did he see no Rachael all the time, but he
avoided every chance of seeing her; for, although he knew that
the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the women working
in the factories, he found that some of them with whom he was
acquainted were changed to him, and he feared to try others, and
dreaded that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if
she were seen in his company.&nbsp; So, he had been quite alone
during the four days, and had spoken to no one, when, as he was
leaving his work at night, a young man of a very light complexion
accosted him in the street.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your name&rsquo;s Blackpool, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;
said the young man.</p>
<p>Stephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his hand, in
his gratitude for being spoken to, or in the suddenness of it, or
both.&nbsp; He made a feint of adjusting the lining, and said,
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are the Hand they have sent to Coventry, I
mean?&rsquo; said Bitzer, the very light young man in
question.</p>
<p>Stephen answered &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away
from you.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby wants to speak to you.&nbsp; You
know his house, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; again.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&lsquo;Then go straight up there, will you?&rsquo; said
Bitzer.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re expected, and have only to tell
the servant it&rsquo;s you.&nbsp; I belong to the Bank; so, if
you go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you),
you&rsquo;ll save me a walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned
about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick
castle of the giant Bounderby.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MEN AND MASTERS</span></h3>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Stephen,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, in his windy manner, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s this I
hear?&nbsp; What have these pests of the earth been doing to
<i>you</i>?&nbsp; Come in, and speak up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden.&nbsp; A
tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s young wife, and
her brother, and a great gentleman from London, were
present.&nbsp; To whom Stephen made his obeisance, closing the
door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the man I was telling you about,
Harthouse,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; The gentleman he
addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up,
saying in an indolent way, &lsquo;Oh really?&rsquo; and dawdled
to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Bounderby, &lsquo;speak up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely
and discordantly on Stephen&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; Besides being a
rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he
really was the self-interested deserter he had been called.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What were it, sir,&rsquo; said Stephen, &lsquo;as yo
were pleased to want wi&rsquo; me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I have told you,&rsquo; returned Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Speak up like a man, since you are a man, and tell us
about yourself and this Combination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wi&rsquo; yor pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Stephen
Blackpool, &lsquo;I ha&rsquo; nowt to sen about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, who was always more or less like a Wind,
finding something in his way here, began to blow at it
directly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, look here, Harthouse,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;here&rsquo;s a specimen of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; When this man
was here once before, I warned this man against the mischievous
strangers who are always about&mdash;and who ought to be hanged
wherever they are found&mdash;and I told this man that he was
going in the wrong direction.&nbsp; Now, would you believe it,
that although they have put this mark upon him, he is such a
slave to them still, that he&rsquo;s afraid to open his lips
about them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sed as I had nowt to sen, sir; not as I was
fearfo&rsquo; o&rsquo; openin&rsquo; my lips.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You said!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; <i>I</i> know what you said;
more than that, I know what you mean, you see.&nbsp; Not always
the same thing, by the Lord Harry!&nbsp; Quite different
things.&nbsp; You had better tell us at once, that that fellow
Slackbridge is not in the town, stirring up the people to mutiny;
and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people: that
is, a most confounded scoundrel.&nbsp; You had better tell us so
at once; you can&rsquo;t deceive me.&nbsp; You want to tell us
so.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m as sooary as yo, sir, when the people&rsquo;s
leaders is bad,&rsquo; said Stephen, shaking his head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They taks such as offers.&nbsp; Haply &rsquo;tis na&rsquo;
the sma&rsquo;est o&rsquo; their misfortuns when they can get no
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wind began to get boisterous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, you&rsquo;ll think this pretty well,
Harthouse,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
think this tolerably strong.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say, upon my soul
this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with; but
this is nothing, sir!&nbsp; You shall hear me ask this man a
question.&nbsp; Pray, Mr. Blackpool&rsquo;&mdash;wind springing
up very fast&mdash;&lsquo;may I take the liberty of asking you
how it happens that you refused to be in this
Combination?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How &rsquo;t happens?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, with his thumbs in the
arms of his coat, and jerking his head and shutting his eyes in
confidence with the opposite wall: &lsquo;how it
happens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d leefer not coom to &rsquo;t, sir; but sin you
put th&rsquo; question&mdash;an&rsquo; not want&rsquo;n t&rsquo;
be ill-manner&rsquo;n&mdash;I&rsquo;ll answer.&nbsp; I ha passed
a promess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to me, you know,&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp;
(Gusty weather with deceitful calms.&nbsp; One now
prevailing.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, sir.&nbsp; Not to yo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for me, any consideration for me has had just
nothing at all to do with it,&rsquo; said Bounderby, still in
confidence with the wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;If only Josiah Bounderby
of Coketown had been in question, you would have joined and made
no bones about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why yes, sir.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though he knows,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, now blowing
a gale, &lsquo;that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom
transportation is too good for!&nbsp; Now, Mr. Harthouse, you
have been knocking about in the world some time.&nbsp; Did you
ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed
country?&rsquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for
inspection, with an angry finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Stephen Blackpool,
staunchly protesting against the words that had been used, and
instinctively addressing himself to Louisa, after glancing at her
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not rebels, nor yet rascals.&nbsp; Nowt
o&rsquo; th&rsquo; kind, ma&rsquo;am, nowt o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
kind.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve not doon me a kindness, ma&rsquo;am, as
I know and feel.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s not a dozen men amoong
&rsquo;em, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;a dozen?&nbsp; Not six&mdash;but
what believes as he has doon his duty by the rest and by
himseln.&nbsp; God forbid as I, that ha&rsquo; known, and
had&rsquo;n experience o&rsquo; these men aw my life&mdash;I,
that ha&rsquo; ett&rsquo;n an&rsquo; droonken wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;em, an&rsquo; seet&rsquo;n wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em, and
toil&rsquo;n wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em, and lov&rsquo;n &rsquo;em,
should fail fur to stan by &rsquo;em wi&rsquo; the truth, let
&rsquo;em ha&rsquo; doon to me what they may!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with the rugged earnestness of his place and
character&mdash;deepened perhaps by a proud consciousness that he
was faithful to his class under all their mistrust; but he fully
remembered where he was, and did not even raise his voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, no.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re true to one
another, faithfo&rsquo; to one another, &rsquo;fectionate to one
another, e&rsquo;en to death.&nbsp; Be poor amoong &rsquo;em, be
sick amoong &rsquo;em, grieve amoong &rsquo;em for onny o&rsquo;
th&rsquo; monny causes that carries grief to the poor man&rsquo;s
door, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be tender wi&rsquo; yo, gentle
wi&rsquo; yo, comfortable wi&rsquo; yo, Chrisen wi&rsquo;
yo.&nbsp; Be sure o&rsquo; that, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d
be riven to bits, ere ever they&rsquo;d be different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In short,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
because they are so full of virtues that they have turned you
adrift.&nbsp; Go through with it while you are about it.&nbsp;
Out with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How &rsquo;tis, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; resumed Stephen,
appearing still to find his natural refuge in Louisa&rsquo;s
face, &lsquo;that what is best in us fok, seems to turn us most
to trouble an&rsquo; misfort&rsquo;n an&rsquo; mistake, I
dunno.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis so.&nbsp; I know &rsquo;tis, as I
know the heavens is over me ahint the smoke.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
patient too, an&rsquo; wants in general to do right.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I canna think the fawt is aw wi&rsquo; us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, whom he
could not have exasperated more, quite unconscious of it though
he was, than by seeming to appeal to any one else, &lsquo;if you
will favour me with your attention for half a minute, I should
like to have a word or two with you.&nbsp; You said just now,
that you had nothing to tell us about this business.&nbsp; You
are quite sure of that before we go any further.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I am sure on &rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a gentleman from London present,&rsquo;
Mr. Bounderby made a backhanded point at Mr. James Harthouse with
his thumb, &lsquo;a Parliament gentleman.&nbsp; I should like him
to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me, instead of
taking the substance of it&mdash;for I know precious well,
beforehand, what it will be; nobody knows better than I do, take
notice!&mdash;instead of receiving it on trust from my
mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen bent his head to the gentleman from London, and showed
a rather more troubled mind than usual.&nbsp; He turned his eyes
involuntarily to his former refuge, but at a look from that
quarter (expressive though instantaneous) he settled them on Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, what do you complain of?&rsquo; asked Mr.
Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha&rsquo; not coom here, sir,&rsquo; Stephen reminded
him, &lsquo;to complain.&nbsp; I coom for that I were sent
for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Bounderby, folding his arms,
&lsquo;do you people, in a general way, complain of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen looked at him with some little irresolution for a
moment, and then seemed to make up his mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I were never good at showin o &rsquo;t, though I
ha had&rsquo;n my share in feeling o &rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;Deed
we are in a muddle, sir.&nbsp; Look round town&mdash;so rich as
&rsquo;tis&mdash;and see the numbers o&rsquo; people as has been
broughten into bein heer, fur to weave, an&rsquo; to card,
an&rsquo; to piece out a livin&rsquo;, aw the same one way,
somehows, &rsquo;twixt their cradles and their graves.&nbsp; Look
how we live, an&rsquo; wheer we live, an&rsquo; in what numbers,
an&rsquo; by what chances, and wi&rsquo; what sameness; and look
how the mills is awlus a goin, and how they never works us no
nigher to ony dis&rsquo;ant object&mdash;ceptin awlus,
Death.&nbsp; Look how you considers of us, and writes of us, and
talks of us, and goes up wi&rsquo; yor deputations to Secretaries
o&rsquo; State &rsquo;bout us, and how yo are awlus right, and
how we are awlus wrong, and never had&rsquo;n no reason in us sin
ever we were born.&nbsp; Look how this ha growen an&rsquo;
growen, sir, bigger an&rsquo; bigger, broader an&rsquo; broader,
harder an&rsquo; harder, fro year to year, fro generation unto
generation.&nbsp; Who can look on &rsquo;t, sir, and fairly tell
a man &rsquo;tis not a muddle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now
perhaps you&rsquo;ll let the gentleman know, how you would set
this muddle (as you&rsquo;re so fond of calling it) to
rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I donno, sir.&nbsp; I canna be expecten to
&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not me as should be looken to for
that, sir.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis them as is put ower me, and ower aw
the rest of us.&nbsp; What do they tak upon themseln, sir, if not
to do&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something towards it, at any
rate,&rsquo; returned Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;We will make an
example of half a dozen Slackbridges.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll indict
the blackguards for felony, and get &rsquo;em shipped off to
penal settlements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen gravely shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me we won&rsquo;t, man,&rsquo; said
Mr. Bounderby, by this time blowing a hurricane, &lsquo;because
we will, I tell you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; returned Stephen, with the quiet confidence
of absolute certainty, &lsquo;if yo was t&rsquo; tak a hundred
Slackbridges&mdash;aw as there is, and aw the number ten times
towd&mdash;an&rsquo; was t&rsquo; sew &rsquo;em up in separate
sacks, an&rsquo; sink &rsquo;em in the deepest ocean as were made
ere ever dry land coom to be, yo&rsquo;d leave the muddle just
wheer &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Mischeevous strangers!&rsquo; said
Stephen, with an anxious smile; &lsquo;when ha we not heern, I am
sure, sin ever we can call to mind, o&rsquo; th&rsquo;
mischeevous strangers!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not by <i>them</i> the
trouble&rsquo;s made, sir.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not wi&rsquo;
<i>them</i> &rsquo;t commences.&nbsp; I ha no favour for
&rsquo;em&mdash;I ha no reason to favour &rsquo;em&mdash;but
&rsquo;tis hopeless and useless to dream o&rsquo; takin them fro
their trade, &rsquo;stead o&rsquo; takin their trade fro
them!&nbsp; Aw that&rsquo;s now about me in this room were heer
afore I coom, an&rsquo; will be heer when I am gone.&nbsp; Put
that clock aboard a ship an&rsquo; pack it off to Norfolk Island,
an&rsquo; the time will go on just the same.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis
wi&rsquo; Slackbridge every bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reverting for a moment to his former refuge, he observed a
cautionary movement of her eyes towards the door.&nbsp; Stepping
back, he put his hand upon the lock.&nbsp; But he had not spoken
out of his own will and desire; and he felt it in his heart a
noble return for his late injurious treatment to be faithful to
the last to those who had repudiated him.&nbsp; He stayed to
finish what was in his mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I canna, wi&rsquo; my little learning an&rsquo; my
common way, tell the genelman what will better aw
this&mdash;though some working men o&rsquo; this town could,
above my powers&mdash;but I can tell him what I know will never
do &rsquo;t.&nbsp; The strong hand will never do &rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Vict&rsquo;ry and triumph will never do &rsquo;t.&nbsp; Agreeing
fur to mak one side unnat&rsquo;rally awlus and for ever right,
and toother side unnat&rsquo;rally awlus and for ever wrong, will
never, never do &rsquo;t.&nbsp; Nor yet lettin alone will never
do &rsquo;t.&nbsp; Let thousands upon thousands alone, aw leading
the like lives and aw faw&rsquo;en into the like muddle, and they
will be as one, and yo will be as anoother, wi&rsquo; a black
unpassable world betwixt yo, just as long or short a time as
sich-like misery can last.&nbsp; Not drawin nigh to fok,
wi&rsquo; kindness and patience an&rsquo; cheery ways, that so
draws nigh to one another in their monny troubles, and so
cherishes one another in their distresses wi&rsquo; what they
need themseln&mdash;like, I humbly believe, as no people the
genelman ha seen in aw his travels can beat&mdash;will never do
&rsquo;t till th&rsquo; Sun turns t&rsquo; ice.&nbsp; Most
o&rsquo; aw, rating &rsquo;em as so much Power, and
reg&rsquo;latin &rsquo;em as if they was figures in a soom, or
machines: wi&rsquo;out loves and likens, wi&rsquo;out memories
and inclinations, wi&rsquo;out souls to weary and souls to
hope&mdash;when aw goes quiet, draggin on wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em as
if they&rsquo;d nowt o&rsquo; th&rsquo; kind, and when aw goes
onquiet, reproachin &rsquo;em for their want o&rsquo; sitch
humanly feelins in their dealins wi&rsquo; yo&mdash;this will
never do &rsquo;t, sir, till God&rsquo;s work is
onmade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen stood with the open door in his hand, waiting to know
if anything more were expected of him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just stop a moment,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
excessively red in the face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I told you, the last
time you were here with a grievance, that you had better turn
about and come out of that.&nbsp; And I also told you, if you
remember, that I was up to the gold spoon look-out.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&lsquo;I were not up to &rsquo;t myseln, sir; I do
assure yo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s clear to me,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;that you are one of those chaps who have always got a
grievance.&nbsp; And you go about, sowing it and raising
crops.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the business of <i>your</i> life, my
friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen shook his head, mutely protesting that indeed he had
other business to do for his life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap,
you see,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;that even your own
Union, the men who know you best, will have nothing to do with
you.&nbsp; I never thought those fellows could be right in
anything; but I tell you what!&nbsp; I so far go along with them
for a novelty, that <i>I</i>&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with you
either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen raised his eyes quickly to his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can finish off what you&rsquo;re at,&rsquo; said
Mr. Bounderby, with a meaning nod, &lsquo;and then go
elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, yo know weel,&rsquo; said Stephen expressively,
&lsquo;that if I canna get work wi&rsquo; yo, I canna get it
elsewheer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reply was, &lsquo;What I know, I know; and what you know,
you know.&nbsp; I have no more to say about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen glanced at Louisa again, but her eyes were raised to
his no more; therefore, with a sigh, and saying, barely above his
breath, &lsquo;Heaven help us aw in this world!&rsquo; he
departed.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FADING AWAY</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was falling dark when Stephen
came out of Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The shadows of
night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him when
he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street.&nbsp;
Nothing was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman
he had encountered on his previous visit to the same house, when
he heard a step behind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in
Rachael&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>He saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Rachael, my dear!&nbsp; Missus, thou wi&rsquo;
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with
reason I must say,&rsquo; the old woman returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here I am again, you see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how wi&rsquo; Rachael?&rsquo; said Stephen, falling
into their step, walking between them, and looking from the one
to the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I
came to be with you,&rsquo; said the old woman, cheerfully,
taking the reply upon herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;My visiting time is
later this year than usual, for I have been rather troubled with
shortness of breath, and so put it off till the weather was fine
and warm.&nbsp; For the same reason I don&rsquo;t make all my
journey in one day, but divide it into two days, and get a bed
to-night at the Travellers&rsquo; Coffee House down by the
railroad (a nice clean house), and go back Parliamentary, at six
in the morning.&nbsp; Well, but what has this to do with this
good lass, says you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to tell you.&nbsp; I
have heard of Mr. Bounderby being married.&nbsp; I read it in the
paper, where it looked grand&mdash;oh, it looked fine!&rsquo; the
old woman dwelt on it with strange enthusiasm: &lsquo;and I want
to see his wife.&nbsp; I have never seen her yet.&nbsp; Now, if
you&rsquo;ll believe me, she hasn&rsquo;t come out of that house
since noon to-day.&nbsp; So not to give her up too easily, I was
waiting about, a little last bit more, when I passed close to
this good lass two or three times; and her face being so friendly
I spoke to her, and she spoke to me.&nbsp; There!&rsquo; said the
old woman to Stephen, &lsquo;you can make all the rest out for
yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity
to dislike this old woman, though her manner was as honest and
simple as a manner possibly could be.&nbsp; With a gentleness
that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael, he
pursued the subject that interested her in her old age.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, missus,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I ha seen the
lady, and she were young and hansom.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; fine dark
thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the
like on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young and handsome.&nbsp; Yes!&rsquo; cried the old
woman, quite delighted.&nbsp; &lsquo;As bonny as a rose!&nbsp;
And what a happy wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, missus, I suppose she be,&rsquo; said
Stephen.&nbsp; But with a doubtful glance at Rachael.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose she be?&nbsp; She must be.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
your master&rsquo;s wife,&rsquo; returned the old woman.</p>
<p>Stephen nodded assent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though as to
master,&rsquo; said he, glancing again at Rachael, &lsquo;not
master onny more.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s aw enden &rsquo;twixt him
and me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you left his work, Stephen?&rsquo; asked Rachael,
anxiously and quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Rachael,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;whether I ha
lef&rsquo;n his work, or whether his work ha lef&rsquo;n me,
cooms t&rsquo; th&rsquo; same.&nbsp; His work and me are
parted.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as weel so&mdash;better, I were thinkin
when yo coom up wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; It would ha brought&rsquo;n
trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer.&nbsp; Haply
&rsquo;tis a kindness to monny that I go; haply &rsquo;tis a
kindness to myseln; anyways it mun be done.&nbsp; I mun turn my
face fro Coketown fur th&rsquo; time, and seek a fort&rsquo;n,
dear, by beginnin fresh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where will you go, Stephen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I donno t&rsquo;night,&rsquo; said he, lifting off his
hat, and smoothing his thin hair with the flat of his hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I&rsquo;m not goin t&rsquo;night, Rachael, nor yet
t&rsquo;morrow.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tan&rsquo;t easy overmuch t&rsquo;
know wheer t&rsquo; turn, but a good heart will coom to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided
him.&nbsp; Before he had so much as closed Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s
door, he had reflected that at least his being obliged to go away
was good for her, as it would save her from the chance of being
brought into question for not withdrawing from him.&nbsp; Though
it would cost him a hard pang to leave her, and though he could
think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not
pursue him, perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from
the endurance of the last four days, even to unknown difficulties
and distresses.</p>
<p>So he said, with truth, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m more leetsome,
Rachael, under &rsquo;t, than I could&rsquo;n ha
believed.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not her part to make his burden
heavier.&nbsp; She answered with her comforting smile, and the
three walked on together.</p>
<p>Age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and
cheerful, finds much consideration among the poor.&nbsp; The old
woman was so decent and contented, and made so light of her
infirmities, though they had increased upon her since her former
interview with Stephen, that they both took an interest in
her.&nbsp; She was too sprightly to allow of their walking at a
slow pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be talked
to, and very willing to talk to any extent: so, when they came to
their part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious than
ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to my poor place, missus,&rsquo; said Stephen,
&lsquo;and tak a coop o&rsquo; tea.&nbsp; Rachael will coom then;
and arterwards I&rsquo;ll see thee safe t&rsquo; thy
Travellers&rsquo; lodgin.&nbsp; &rsquo;T may be long, Rachael,
ere ever I ha th&rsquo; chance o&rsquo; thy coompany
agen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They complied, and the three went on to the house where he
lodged.&nbsp; When they turned into a narrow street, Stephen
glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his
desolate home; but it was open, as he had left it, and no one was
there.&nbsp; The evil spirit of his life had flitted away again,
months ago, and he had heard no more of her since.&nbsp; The only
evidence of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in
his room, and the grayer hair upon his head.</p>
<p>He lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot
water from below, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar,
a loaf, and some butter from the nearest shop.&nbsp; The bread
was new and crusty, the butter fresh, and the sugar lump, of
course&mdash;in fulfilment of the standard testimony of the
Coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes,
sir.&nbsp; Rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated
the borrowing of a cup), and the visitor enjoyed it
mightily.&nbsp; It was the first glimpse of sociality the host
had had for many days.&nbsp; He too, with the world a wide heath
before him, enjoyed the meal&mdash;again in corroboration of the
magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the
part of these people, sir.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha never thowt yet, missus,&rsquo; said Stephen,
&lsquo;o&rsquo; askin thy name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old lady announced herself as &lsquo;Mrs.
Pegler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A widder, I think?&rsquo; said Stephen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, many long years!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Pegler&rsquo;s
husband (one of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs.
Pegler&rsquo;s calculation, when Stephen was born.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a
one,&rsquo; said Stephen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Onny children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pegler&rsquo;s cup, rattling against her saucer as she
held it, denoted some nervousness on her part.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not now, not
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead, Stephen,&rsquo; Rachael softly hinted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sooary I ha spok&rsquo;n on &rsquo;t,&rsquo;
said Stephen, &lsquo;I ought t&rsquo; hadn in my mind as I might
touch a sore place.&nbsp; I&mdash;I blame myseln.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While he excused himself, the old lady&rsquo;s cup rattled
more and more.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had a son,&rsquo; she said,
curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of
sorrow; &lsquo;and he did well, wonderfully well.&nbsp; But he is
not to be spoken of if you please.&nbsp; He
is&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Putting down her cup, she moved her hands
as if she would have added, by her action,
&lsquo;dead!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she said aloud, &lsquo;I have lost
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old
lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs,
and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear.&nbsp; Mrs.
Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was
uttered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bounderby!&rsquo; she cried, in a suppressed voice,
starting up from the table.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh hide me!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let me be seen for the world.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let
him come up till I&rsquo;ve got away.&nbsp; Pray,
pray!&rsquo;&nbsp; She trembled, and was excessively agitated;
getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to reassure her; and
not seeming to know what she was about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But hearken, missus, hearken,&rsquo; said Stephen,
astonished.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t Mr. Bounderby;
&rsquo;tis his wife.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo;r not fearfo&rsquo; o&rsquo;
her.&nbsp; Yo was hey-go-mad about her, but an hour
sin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But are you sure it&rsquo;s the lady, and not the
gentleman?&rsquo; she asked, still trembling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certain sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then, pray don&rsquo;t speak to me, nor yet take
any notice of me,&rsquo; said the old woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me
be quite to myself in this corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which
she was quite unable to give him; took the candle, went
downstairs, and in a few moments returned, lighting Louisa into
the room.&nbsp; She was followed by the whelp.</p>
<p>Rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet
in her hand, when Stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this
visit, put the candle on the table.&nbsp; Then he too stood, with
his doubled hand upon the table near it, waiting to be
addressed.</p>
<p>For the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the
dwellings of the Coketown Hands; for the first time in her life
she was face to face with anything like individuality in
connection with them.&nbsp; She knew of their existence by
hundreds and by thousands.&nbsp; She knew what results in work a
given number of them would produce in a given space of
time.&nbsp; She knew them in crowds passing to and from their
nests, like ants or beetles.&nbsp; But she knew from her reading
infinitely more of the ways of toiling insects than of these
toiling men and women.</p>
<p>Something to be worked so much and paid so much, and there
ended; something to be infallibly settled by laws of supply and
demand; something that blundered against those laws, and
floundered into difficulty; something that was a little pinched
when wheat was dear, and over-ate itself when wheat was cheap;
something that increased at such a rate of percentage, and
yielded such another percentage of crime, and such another
percentage of pauperism; something wholesale, of which vast
fortunes were made; something that occasionally rose like a sea,
and did some harm and waste (chiefly to itself), and fell again;
this she knew the Coketown Hands to be.&nbsp; But, she had
scarcely thought more of separating them into units, than of
separating the sea itself into its component drops.</p>
<p>She stood for some moments looking round the room.&nbsp; From
the few chairs, the few books, the common prints, and the bed,
she glanced to the two women, and to Stephen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what
passed just now.&nbsp; I should like to be serviceable to you, if
you will let me.&nbsp; Is this your wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no,
and dropped again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember,&rsquo; said Louisa, reddening at her
mistake; &lsquo;I recollect, now, to have heard your domestic
misfortunes spoken of, though I was not attending to the
particulars at the time.&nbsp; It was not my meaning to ask a
question that would give pain to any one here.&nbsp; If I should
ask any other question that may happen to have that result, give
me credit, if you please, for being in ignorance how to speak to
you as I ought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed
himself to her, so she now instinctively addressed herself to
Rachael.&nbsp; Her manner was short and abrupt, yet faltering and
timid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has told you what has passed between himself and my
husband?&nbsp; You would be his first resource, I
think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard the end of it, young lady,&rsquo; said
Rachael.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I understand, that, being rejected by one employer,
he would probably be rejected by all?&nbsp; I thought he said as
much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The chances are very small, young lady&mdash;next to
nothing&mdash;for a man who gets a bad name among
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall I understand that you mean by a bad
name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The name of being troublesome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the
prejudices of the other, he is sacrificed alike?&nbsp; Are the
two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place
whatever for an honest workman between them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachael shook her head in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He fell into suspicion,&rsquo; said Louisa, &lsquo;with
his fellow-weavers, because&mdash;he had made a promise not to be
one of them.&nbsp; I think it must have been to you that he made
that promise.&nbsp; Might I ask you why he made it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachael burst into tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t seek it
of him, poor lad.&nbsp; I prayed him to avoid trouble for his own
good, little thinking he&rsquo;d come to it through me.&nbsp; But
I know he&rsquo;d die a hundred deaths, ere ever he&rsquo;d break
his word.&nbsp; I know that of him well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual
thoughtful attitude, with his hand at his chin.&nbsp; He now
spoke in a voice rather less steady than usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour,
an&rsquo; what love, an&rsquo; respect, I bear to Rachael, or
wi&rsquo; what cause.&nbsp; When I passed that promess, I towd
her true, she were th&rsquo; Angel o&rsquo; my life.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twere a solemn promess.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis gone fro&rsquo;
me, for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference
that was new in her.&nbsp; She looked from him to Rachael, and
her features softened.&nbsp; &lsquo;What will you do?&rsquo; she
asked him.&nbsp; And her voice had softened too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Weel, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Stephen, making the best
of it, with a smile; &lsquo;when I ha finished off, I mun quit
this part, and try another.&nbsp; Fortnet or misfortnet, a man
can but try; there&rsquo;s nowt to be done wi&rsquo;out
tryin&rsquo;&mdash;cept laying down and dying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How will you travel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.&nbsp; The
rustling of a bank-note was audible, as she unfolded one and laid
it on the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachael, will you tell him&mdash;for you know how,
without offence&mdash;that this is freely his, to help him on his
way?&nbsp; Will you entreat him to take it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I canna do that, young lady,&rsquo; she answered,
turning her head aside.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bless you for thinking
o&rsquo; the poor lad wi&rsquo; such tenderness.&nbsp; But
&rsquo;tis for him to know his heart, and what is right according
to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in
part overcome with quick sympathy, when this man of so much
self-command, who had been so plain and steady through the late
interview, lost his composure in a moment, and now stood with his
hand before his face.&nbsp; She stretched out hers, as if she
would have touched him; then checked herself, and remained
still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not e&rsquo;en Rachael,&rsquo; said Stephen, when he
stood again with his face uncovered, &lsquo;could mak sitch a
kind offerin, by onny words, kinder.&nbsp; T&rsquo; show that
I&rsquo;m not a man wi&rsquo;out reason and gratitude, I&rsquo;ll
tak two pound.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll borrow &rsquo;t for t&rsquo; pay
&rsquo;t back.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be the sweetest work as ever I
ha done, that puts it in my power t&rsquo; acknowledge once more
my lastin thankfulness for this present action.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was fain to take up the note again, and to substitute the
much smaller sum he had named.&nbsp; He was neither courtly, nor
handsome, nor picturesque, in any respect; and yet his manner of
accepting it, and of expressing his thanks without more words,
had a grace in it that Lord Chesterfield could not have taught
his son in a century.</p>
<p>Tom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his
walking-stick with sufficient unconcern, until the visit had
attained this stage.&nbsp; Seeing his sister ready to depart, he
got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just wait a moment, Loo!&nbsp; Before we go, I should
like to speak to him a moment.&nbsp; Something comes into my
head.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool,
I&rsquo;ll mention it.&nbsp; Never mind a light,
man!&rsquo;&nbsp; Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving
towards the cupboard, to get one.&nbsp; &lsquo;It don&rsquo;t
want a light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and
held the lock in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say!&rsquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I can
do you a good turn.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask me what it is, because
it may not come to anything.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no harm in
my trying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen&rsquo;s ear,
it was so hot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was our light porter at the Bank,&rsquo; said Tom,
&lsquo;who brought you the message to-night.&nbsp; I call him our
light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen thought, &lsquo;What a hurry he is in!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
spoke so confusedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now look
here!&nbsp; When are you off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;T&rsquo; day&rsquo;s Monday,&rsquo; replied Stephen,
considering.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh
&rsquo;bout.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friday or Saturday,&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now
look here!&nbsp; I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I
want to do you&mdash;that&rsquo;s my sister, you know, in your
room&mdash;but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to,
there&rsquo;s no harm done.&nbsp; So I tell you what.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll know our light porter again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sure,&rsquo; said Stephen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; returned Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;When you
leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just
hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
take on, as if you meant anything, if he should see you hanging
about there; because I shan&rsquo;t put him up to speak to you,
unless I find I can do you the service I want to do you.&nbsp; In
that case he&rsquo;ll have a note or a message for you, but not
else.&nbsp; Now look here!&nbsp; You are sure you
understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a button-hole
of Stephen&rsquo;s coat, and was screwing that corner of the
garment tight up round and round, in an extraordinary manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand, sir,&rsquo; said Stephen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now look here!&rsquo; repeated Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be
sure you don&rsquo;t make any mistake then, and don&rsquo;t
forget.&nbsp; I shall tell my sister as we go home, what I have
in view, and she&rsquo;ll approve, I know.&nbsp; Now look
here!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re all right, are you?&nbsp; You understand
all about it?&nbsp; Very well then.&nbsp; Come along,
Loo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pushed the door open as he called to her, but did not
return into the room, or wait to be lighted down the narrow
stairs.&nbsp; He was at the bottom when she began to descend, and
was in the street before she could take his arm.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother and
sister were gone, and until Stephen came back with the candle in
his hand.&nbsp; She was in a state of inexpressible admiration of
Mrs. Bounderby, and, like an unaccountable old woman, wept,
&lsquo;because she was such a pretty dear.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet Mrs.
Pegler was so flurried lest the object of her admiration should
return by chance, or anybody else should come, that her
cheerfulness was ended for that night.&nbsp; It was late too, to
people who rose early and worked hard; therefore the party broke
up; and Stephen and Rachael escorted their mysterious
acquaintance to the door of the Travellers&rsquo; Coffee House,
where they parted from her.</p>
<p>They walked back together to the corner of the street where
Rachael lived, and as they drew nearer and nearer to it, silence
crept upon them.&nbsp; When they came to the dark corner where
their unfrequent meetings always ended, they stopped, still
silent, as if both were afraid to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall strive t&rsquo; see thee agen, Rachael, afore I
go, but if not&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis better
that we make up our minds to be open wi&rsquo; one
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;rt awlus right.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis bolder and
better.&nbsp; I ha been thinkin then, Rachael, that as &rsquo;tis
but a day or two that remains, &rsquo;twere better for thee, my
dear, not t&rsquo; be seen wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; &rsquo;T might
bring thee into trouble, fur no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not for that, Stephen, that I mind.&nbsp;
But thou know&rsquo;st our old agreement.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis for
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
better, onnyways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;lt write to me, and tell me all that
happens, Stephen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; What can I say now, but Heaven be wi&rsquo;
thee, Heaven bless thee, Heaven thank thee and reward
thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May it bless thee, Stephen, too, in all thy wanderings,
and send thee peace and rest at last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I towd thee, my dear,&rsquo; said Stephen
Blackpool&mdash;&lsquo;that night&mdash;that I would never see or
think o&rsquo; onnything that angered me, but thou, so much
better than me, should&rsquo;st be beside it.&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;rt
beside it now.&nbsp; Thou mak&rsquo;st me see it wi&rsquo; a
better eye.&nbsp; Bless thee.&nbsp; Good night.&nbsp;
Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was but a hurried parting in a common street, yet it was a
sacred remembrance to these two common people.&nbsp; Utilitarian
economists, skeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact,
genteel and used-up infidels, gabblers of many little
dog&rsquo;s-eared creeds, the poor you will have always with
you.&nbsp; Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the utmost
graces of the fancies and affections, to adorn their lives so
much in need of ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, when
romance is utterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare
existence stand face to face, Reality will take a wolfish turn,
and make an end of you.</p>
<p>Stephen worked the next day, and the next, uncheered by a word
from any one, and shunned in all his comings and goings as
before.&nbsp; At the end of the second day, he saw land; at the
end of the third, his loom stood empty.</p>
<p>He had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank, on
each of the two first evenings; and nothing had happened there,
good or bad.&nbsp; That he might not be remiss in his part of the
engagement, he resolved to wait full two hours, on this third and
last night.</p>
<p>There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s
house, sitting at the first-floor window as he had seen her
before; and there was the light porter, sometimes talking with
her there, and sometimes looking over the blind below which had
<span class="smcap">Bank</span> upon it, and sometimes coming to
the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air.&nbsp;
When he first came out, Stephen thought he might be looking for
him, and passed near; but the light porter only cast his winking
eyes upon him slightly, and said nothing.</p>
<p>Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long
day&rsquo;s labour.&nbsp; Stephen sat upon the step of a door,
leaned against a wall under an archway, strolled up and down,
listened for the church clock, stopped and watched children
playing in the street.&nbsp; Some purpose or other is so natural
to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels
remarkable.&nbsp; When the first hour was out, Stephen even began
to have an uncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time
a disreputable character.</p>
<p>Then came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light
all down the long perspective of the street, until they were
blended and lost in the distance.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit closed the
first-floor window, drew down the blind, and went
up-stairs.&nbsp; Presently, a light went up-stairs after her,
passing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two
staircase windows, on its way up.&nbsp; By and by, one corner of
the second-floor blind was disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s
eye were there; also the other corner, as if the light
porter&rsquo;s eye were on that side.&nbsp; Still, no
communication was made to Stephen.&nbsp; Much relieved when the
two hours were at last accomplished, he went away at a quick
pace, as a recompense for so much loitering.</p>
<p>He had only to take leave of his landlady, and lie down on his
temporary bed upon the floor; for his bundle was made up for
to-morrow, and all was arranged for his departure.&nbsp; He meant
to be clear of the town very early; before the Hands were in the
streets.</p>
<p>It was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look round his
room, mournfully wondering whether he should ever see it again,
he went out.&nbsp; The town was as entirely deserted as if the
inhabitants had abandoned it, rather than hold communication with
him.&nbsp; Everything looked wan at that hour.&nbsp; Even the
coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky, like a sad sea.</p>
<p>By the place where Rachael lived, though it was not in his
way; by the red brick streets; by the great silent factories, not
trembling yet; by the railway, where the danger-lights were
waning in the strengthening day; by the railway&rsquo;s crazy
neighbourhood, half pulled down and half built up; by scattered
red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled
with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by coal-dust paths
and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got to the top of the
hill, and looked back.</p>
<p>Day was shining radiantly upon the town then, and the bells
were going for the morning work.&nbsp; Domestic fires were not
yet lighted, and the high chimneys had the sky to
themselves.&nbsp; Puffing out their poisonous volumes, they would
not be long in hiding it; but, for half an hour, some of the many
windows were golden, which showed the Coketown people a sun
eternally in eclipse, through a medium of smoked glass.</p>
<p>So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds.&nbsp; So
strange, <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>to have the road-dust on his feet instead of the
coal-grit.&nbsp; So strange to have lived to his time of life,
and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning!&nbsp;
With these musings in his mind, and his bundle under his arm,
Stephen took his attentive face along the high road.&nbsp; And
the trees arched over him, whispering that he left a true and
loving heart behind.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GUNPOWDER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. James Harthouse</span>, &lsquo;going
in&rsquo; for his adopted party, soon began to score.&nbsp; With
the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages, a
little more genteel listlessness for the general society, and a
tolerable management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty, most
effective and most patronized of the polite deadly sins, he
speedily came to be considered of much promise.&nbsp; The not
being troubled with earnestness was a grand point in his favour,
enabling him to take to the hard Fact fellows with as good a
grace as if he had been born one of the tribe, and to throw all
other tribes overboard, as conscious hypocrites.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom none of us believe, my dear Mrs. Bounderby, and
who do not believe themselves.&nbsp; The only difference between
us and the professors of virtue or benevolence, or
philanthropy&mdash;never mind the name&mdash;is, that we know it
is all meaningless, and say so; while they know it equally and
will never say so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration?&nbsp;
It was not so unlike her father&rsquo;s principles, and her early
training, that it need startle her.&nbsp; Where was the great
difference between the two schools, when each chained her down to
material realities, and inspired her with no faith in anything
else?&nbsp; What was there in her soul for James Harthouse to
destroy, which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its state
of innocence!</p>
<p>It was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her
mind&mdash;implanted there before her eminently practical father
began to form it&mdash;a struggling disposition to believe in a
wider and nobler humanity than she had ever heard of, constantly
strove with doubts and resentments.&nbsp; With doubts, because
the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth.&nbsp; With
resentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it
were indeed a whisper of the truth.&nbsp; Upon a nature long
accustomed to self-suppression, thus torn and divided, the
Harthouse philosophy came as a relief and justification.&nbsp;
Everything being hollow and worthless, she had missed nothing and
sacrificed nothing.&nbsp; What did it matter, she had said to her
father, when he proposed her husband.&nbsp; What did it matter,
she said still.&nbsp; With a scornful self-reliance, she asked
herself, What did anything matter&mdash;and went on.</p>
<p>Towards what?&nbsp; Step by step, onward and downward, towards
some end, yet so gradually, that she believed herself to remain
motionless.&nbsp; As to Mr. Harthouse, whither <i>he</i> tended,
he neither considered nor cared.&nbsp; He had no particular
design or plan before him: no energetic wickedness ruffled his
lassitude.&nbsp; He was as much amused and interested, at
present, as it became so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even
more than it would have been consistent with his reputation to
confess.&nbsp; Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his
brother, the honourable and jocular member, that the Bounderbys
were &lsquo;great fun;&rsquo; and further, that the female
Bounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was
young, and remarkably pretty.&nbsp; After that, he wrote no more
about them, and devoted his leisure chiefly to their house.&nbsp;
He was very often in their house, in his flittings and visitings
about the Coketown district; and was much encouraged by Mr.
Bounderby.&nbsp; It was quite in Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s gusty way
to boast to all his world that <i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t care about
your highly connected people, but that if his wife Tom
Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter did, she was welcome to their
company.</p>
<p>Mr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new
sensation, if the face which changed so beautifully for the
whelp, would change for him.</p>
<p>He was quick enough to observe; he had a good memory, and did
not forget a word of the brother&rsquo;s revelations.&nbsp; He
interwove them with everything he saw of the sister, and he began
to understand her.&nbsp; To be sure, the better and profounder
part of her character was not within his scope of perception; for
in natures, as in seas, depth answers unto depth; but he soon
began to read the rest with a student&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds,
about fifteen miles from the town, and accessible within a mile
or two, by a railway striding on many arches over a wild country,
undermined by deserted coal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires
and black shapes of stationary engines at pits&rsquo;
mouths.&nbsp; This country, gradually softening towards the
neighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s retreat, there mellowed
into a rustic landscape, golden with heath, and snowy with
hawthorn in the spring of the year, and tremulous with leaves and
their shadows all the summer time.&nbsp; The bank had foreclosed
a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated, by
one of the Coketown magnates, who, in his determination to make a
shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune, overspeculated
himself by about two hundred thousand pounds.&nbsp; These
accidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of
Coketown, but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the
improvident classes.</p>
<p>It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal
himself in this snug little estate, and with demonstrative
humility to grow cabbages in the flower-garden.&nbsp; He
delighted to live, barrack-fashion, among the elegant furniture,
and he bullied the very pictures with his origin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; he would say to a visitor, &lsquo;I am
told that Nickits,&rsquo; the late owner, &lsquo;gave seven
hundred pound for that Seabeach.&nbsp; Now, to be plain with you,
if I ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks at
it, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as I shall
do.&nbsp; No, by George!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t forget that I am
Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.&nbsp; For years upon years, the
only pictures in my possession, or that I could have got into my
possession, by any means, unless I stole &rsquo;em, were the
engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot, on the blacking
bottles that I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and
that I sold when they were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad
to get it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here.&nbsp;
Bring half a dozen more if you like, and we&rsquo;ll find room
for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s stabling in this place for a
dozen horses; and unless Nickits is belied, he kept the full
number.&nbsp; A round dozen of &rsquo;em, sir.&nbsp; When that
man was a boy, he went to Westminster School.&nbsp; Went to
Westminster School as a King&rsquo;s Scholar, when I was
principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market
baskets.&nbsp; Why, if I wanted to keep a dozen
horses&mdash;which I don&rsquo;t, for one&rsquo;s enough for
me&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t bear to see &rsquo;em in their stalls
here, and think what my own lodging used to be.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t look at &rsquo;em, sir, and not order &rsquo;em
out.&nbsp; Yet so things come round.&nbsp; You see this place;
you know what sort of a place it is; you are aware that
there&rsquo;s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom
or elsewhere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care where&mdash;and here, got
into the middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is Josiah
Bounderby.&nbsp; While Nickits (as a man came into my office, and
told me yesterday), Nickits, who used to act in Latin, in the
Westminster School plays, with the chief-justices and nobility of
this country applauding him till they were black in the face, is
drivelling at this minute&mdash;drivelling, sir!&mdash;in a fifth
floor, up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was among the leafy shadows of this retirement, in the long
sultry summer days, that Mr. Harthouse began to prove the face
which had set him wondering when he first saw it, and to try if
it would change for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby, I esteem it a most fortunate accident
that I find you alone here.&nbsp; I have for some time had a
particular wish to speak to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not by any wonderful accident that he found her, the
time of day being that at which she was always alone, and the
place being her favourite resort.&nbsp; It was an opening in a
dark wood, where some felled trees lay, and where she would sit
watching the fallen leaves of last year, as she had watched the
falling ashes at home.</p>
<p>He sat down beside her, with a glance at her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your brother.&nbsp; My young friend
Tom&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her colour brightened, and she turned to him with a look of
interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never in my life,&rsquo; he thought,
&lsquo;saw anything so remarkable and so captivating as the
lighting of those features!&rsquo;&nbsp; His face betrayed his
thoughts&mdash;perhaps without betraying him, for it might have
been according to its instructions so to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me.&nbsp; The expression of your sisterly
interest is so beautiful&mdash;Tom should be so proud of
it&mdash;I know this is inexcusable, but I am so compelled to
admire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Being so impulsive,&rsquo; she said composedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby, no: you know I make no pretence with
you.&nbsp; You know I am a sordid piece of human nature, ready to
sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum, and altogether
incapable of any Arcadian proceeding whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am waiting,&rsquo; she returned, &lsquo;for your
further reference to my brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are rigid with me, and I deserve it.&nbsp; I am as
worthless a dog as you will find, except that I am not
false&mdash;not false.&nbsp; But you surprised and started me
from my subject, which was your brother.&nbsp; I have an interest
in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?&rsquo;
she asked, half incredulously and half gratefully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had asked me when I first came here, I should
have said no.&nbsp; I must say now&mdash;even at the hazard of
appearing to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your
incredulity&mdash;yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made a slight movement, as if she were trying to speak,
but could not find voice; at length she said, &lsquo;Mr.
Harthouse, I give you credit for being interested in my
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I claim to deserve it.&nbsp; You know
how little I do claim, but I will go that length.&nbsp; You have
done so much for him, you are so fond of him; your whole life,
Mrs. Bounderby, expresses such charming self-forgetfulness on his
account&mdash;pardon me again&mdash;I am running wide of the
subject.&nbsp; I am interested in him for his own
sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had made the slightest action possible, as if she would
have risen in a hurry and gone away.&nbsp; He had turned the
course of what he said at that instant, and she remained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby,&rsquo; he resumed, in a lighter manner,
and yet with a show of effort in assuming it, which was even more
expressive than the manner he dismissed; &lsquo;it is no
irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother&rsquo;s
years, if he is heedless, inconsiderate, and expensive&mdash;a
little dissipated, in the common phrase.&nbsp; Is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Allow me to be frank.&nbsp; Do you think he games at
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he makes bets.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Harthouse
waiting, as if that were not her whole answer, she added,
&lsquo;I know he does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course he loses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everybody does lose who bets.&nbsp; May I hint at the
probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these
purposes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sat, looking down; but, at this question, raised her eyes
searchingly and a little resentfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs.
Bounderby.&nbsp; I think Tom may be gradually falling into
trouble, and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the
depths of my wicked experience.&mdash;Shall I say again, for his
sake?&nbsp; Is that necessary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to
me,&rsquo; said James Harthouse, again gliding with the same
appearance of effort into his more airy manner; &lsquo;I will
confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages.&nbsp;
Whether&mdash;forgive my plainness&mdash;whether any great amount
of confidence is likely to have been established between himself
and his most worthy father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; said Louisa, flushing with her own
great remembrance in that wise, &lsquo;think it
likely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or, between himself, and&mdash;I may trust to your
perfect understanding of my meaning, I am sure&mdash;and his
highly esteemed brother-in-law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she
replied in a fainter voice, &lsquo;I do not think that likely,
either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby,&rsquo; said Harthouse, after a short
silence, &lsquo;may there be a better confidence between yourself
and me?&nbsp; Tom has borrowed a considerable sum of
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will understand, Mr. Harthouse,&rsquo; she
returned, after some indecision: she had been more or less
uncertain, and troubled throughout the conversation, and yet had
in the main preserved her self-contained manner; &lsquo;you will
understand that if I tell you what you press to know, it is not
by way of complaint or regret.&nbsp; I would never complain of
anything, and what I have done I do not in the least
regret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So spirited, too!&rsquo; thought James Harthouse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I married, I found that my brother was even at
that time heavily in debt.&nbsp; Heavily for him, I mean.&nbsp;
Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets.&nbsp; They
were no sacrifice.&nbsp; I sold them very willingly.&nbsp; I
attached no value to them.&nbsp; They, were quite worthless to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Either she saw in his face that he knew, or she only feared in
her conscience that he knew, that she spoke of some of her
husband&rsquo;s gifts.&nbsp; She stopped, and reddened
again.&nbsp; If he had not known it before, he would have known
it then, though he had been a much duller man than he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since then, I have given my brother, at various times,
what money I could spare: in short, what money I have had.&nbsp;
Confiding in you at all, on the faith of the interest you profess
for him, I will not do so by halves.&nbsp; Since you have been in
the habit of visiting here, he has wanted in one sum as much as a
hundred pounds.&nbsp; I have not been able to give it to
him.&nbsp; I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being
so involved, but I have kept these secrets until now, when I
trust them to your honour.&nbsp; I have held no confidence with
any one, because&mdash;you anticipated my reason just
now.&rsquo;&nbsp; She abruptly broke off.</p>
<p>He was a ready man, and he saw, and seized, an opportunity
here of presenting her own image to her, slightly disguised as
her brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby, though a graceless person, of the world
worldly, I feel the utmost interest, I assure you, in what you
tell me.&nbsp; I cannot possibly be hard upon your brother.&nbsp;
I understand and share the wise consideration with which you
regard his errors.&nbsp; With all possible respect both for Mr.
Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby, I think I perceive that he has
not been fortunate in his training.&nbsp; Bred at a disadvantage
towards the society in which he has his part to play, he rushes
into these extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have
long been forced&mdash;with the very best intentions we have no
doubt&mdash;upon him.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s fine bluff
English independence, though a most charming characteristic, does
not&mdash;as we have agreed&mdash;invite confidence.&nbsp; If I
might venture to remark that it is the least in the world
deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken, a character
misconceived, and abilities misdirected, would turn for relief
and guidance, I should express what it presents to my own
view.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she sat looking straight before her, across the changing
lights upon the grass into the darkness of the wood beyond, he
saw in her face her application of his very distinctly uttered
words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All allowance,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;must be
made.&nbsp; I have one great fault to find with Tom, however,
which I cannot forgive, and for which I take him heavily to
account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault
was that?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;I have said
enough.&nbsp; Perhaps it would have been better, on the whole, if
no allusion to it had escaped me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You alarm me, Mr. Harthouse.&nbsp; Pray let me know
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&lsquo;To relieve you from needless
apprehension&mdash;and as this confidence regarding your brother,
which I prize I am sure above all possible things, has been
established between us&mdash;I obey.&nbsp; I cannot forgive him
for not being more sensible in every word, look, and act of his
life, of the affection of his best friend; of the devotion of his
best friend; of her unselfishness; of her sacrifice.&nbsp; The
return he makes her, within my observation, is a very poor
one.&nbsp; What she has done for him demands his constant love
and gratitude, not his ill-humour and caprice.&nbsp; Careless
fellow as I am, I am not so indifferent, Mrs. Bounderby, as to be
regardless of this vice in your brother, or inclined to consider
it a venial offence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wood floated before her, for her eyes were suffused with
tears.&nbsp; They rose from a deep well, long concealed, and her
heart was filled with acute pain that found no relief in
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs.
Bounderby, that I must aspire.&nbsp; My better knowledge of his
circumstances, and my direction and advice in extricating
them&mdash;rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a scapegrace
on a much larger scale&mdash;will give me some influence over
him, and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.&nbsp;
I have said enough, and more than enough.&nbsp; I seem to be
protesting that I am a sort of good fellow, when, upon my honour,
I have not the least intention to make any protestation to that
effect, and openly announce that I am nothing of the sort.&nbsp;
Yonder, among the trees,&rsquo; he added, having lifted up his
eyes and looked about; for he had watched her closely until now;
&lsquo;is your brother himself; no doubt, just come down.&nbsp;
As he seems to be loitering in this direction, it may be as well,
perhaps, to walk towards him, and throw ourselves in his
way.&nbsp; He has been very silent and doleful of late.&nbsp;
Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched&mdash;if there are
such things as consciences.&nbsp; Though, upon my honour, I hear
of them much too often to believe in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they
advanced to meet the whelp.&nbsp; He was idly beating the
branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to rip the
moss from the trees with his stick.&nbsp; He was startled when
they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime,
and his colour changed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Halloa!&rsquo; he stammered; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
you were here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose name, Tom,&rsquo; said Mr. Harthouse, putting his
hand upon his shoulder and turning him, so that they all three
walked towards the house together, &lsquo;have you been carving
on the trees?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose name?&rsquo; returned Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp;
You mean what girl&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some
fair creature&rsquo;s on the bark, Tom.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p132b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the garden"

"Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the garden"
src="images/p132s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair
creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a
fancy to me.&nbsp; Or she might be as ugly as she was rich,
without any fear of losing me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d carve her name as
often as she liked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mercenary,&rsquo; repeated Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is not
mercenary?&nbsp; Ask my sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine,
Tom?&rsquo; said Louisa, showing no other sense of his discontent
and ill-nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,&rsquo; returned
her brother sulkily.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it does, you can wear
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are
now and then,&rsquo; said Mr. Harthouse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
believe him, Mrs. Bounderby.&nbsp; He knows much better.&nbsp; I
shall disclose some of his opinions of you, privately expressed
to me, unless he relents a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At all events, Mr. Harthouse,&rsquo; said Tom,
softening in his admiration of his patron, but shaking his head
sullenly too, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t tell her that I ever praised
her for being mercenary.&nbsp; I may have praised her for being
the contrary, and I should do it again, if I had as good
reason.&nbsp; However, never mind this now; it&rsquo;s not very
interesting to you, and I am sick of the subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They walked on to the house, where Louisa quitted her
visitor&rsquo;s arm and went in.&nbsp; He stood looking after
her, as she ascended the steps, and passed into the shadow of the
door; then put his hand upon her brother&rsquo;s shoulder again,
and invited him with a confidential nod to a walk in the
garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom, my fine fellow, I want to have a word with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had stopped among a disorder of roses&mdash;it was part
of Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s humility to keep Nickits&rsquo;s roses
on a reduced scale&mdash;and Tom sat down on a terrace-parapet,
plucking buds and picking them to pieces; while his powerful
Familiar stood over him, with a foot upon the parapet, and his
figure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee.&nbsp;
They were just visible from her window.&nbsp; Perhaps she saw
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Harthouse,&rsquo; said Tom with a groan,
&lsquo;I am hard up, and bothered out of my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good fellow, so am I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; returned Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are the
picture of independence.&nbsp; Mr. Harthouse, I am in a horrible
mess.&nbsp; You have no idea what a state I have got myself
into&mdash;what a state my sister might have got me out of, if
she would only have done it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from
his teeth with a hand that trembled like an infirm old
man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; After one exceedingly observant look at him,
his companion relapsed into his lightest air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your
sister.&nbsp; You have had money of her, you dog, you know you
have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have.&nbsp; How else was
I to get it?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s old Bounderby always boasting
that at my age he lived upon twopence a month, or something of
that sort.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my father drawing what he calls a
line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck and heels.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s my mother who never has anything of her own, except
her complaints.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> a fellow to do for money,
and where <i>am</i> I to look for it, if not to my
sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was almost crying, and scattered the buds about by
dozens.&nbsp; Mr. Harthouse took him persuasively by the
coat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got
it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not got it, Mr. Harthouse?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say she
has got it.&nbsp; I may have wanted more than she was likely to
have got.&nbsp; But then she ought to get it.&nbsp; She could get
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s of no use pretending to make a secret of
matters now, after what I have told you already; you know she
didn&rsquo;t marry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his
sake, but for my sake.&nbsp; Then why doesn&rsquo;t she get what
I want, out of him, for my sake?&nbsp; She is not obliged to say
what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough; she could
manage to coax it out of him, if she chose.&nbsp; Then why
doesn&rsquo;t she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it
is?&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; There she sits in his company like a
stone, instead of making herself agreeable and getting it
easily.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what you may call this, but I
call it unnatural conduct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the
parapet, on the other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a
very strong inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as
the injured men of Coketown threatened to pitch their property
into the Atlantic.&nbsp; But he preserved his easy attitude; and
nothing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the
accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little
surface-island.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Tom,&rsquo; said Harthouse, &lsquo;let me try
to be your banker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; replied Tom, suddenly,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk about bankers!&rsquo;&nbsp; And very
white he looked, in contrast with the roses.&nbsp; Very
white.</p>
<p>Mr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to
the best society, was not to be surprised&mdash;he could as soon
have been affected&mdash;but he raised his eyelids a little more,
as if they were lifted by a feeble touch of wonder.&nbsp; Albeit
it was as much against the precepts of his school to wonder, as
it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind College.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the present need, Tom?&nbsp; Three
figures?&nbsp; Out with them.&nbsp; Say what they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Harthouse,&rsquo; returned Tom, now actually
crying; and his tears were better than his injuries, however
pitiful a figure he made: &lsquo;it&rsquo;s too late; the money
is of no use to me at present.&nbsp; I should have had it before
to be of use to me.&nbsp; But I am very much obliged to you;
you&rsquo;re a true friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A true friend!&nbsp; &lsquo;Whelp, whelp!&rsquo; thought Mr.
Harthouse, lazily; &lsquo;what an Ass you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I take your offer as a great kindness,&rsquo; said
Tom, grasping his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;As a great kindness, Mr.
Harthouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned the other, &lsquo;it may be of
more use by and by.&nbsp; And, my good fellow, if you will open
your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show
you better ways out of them than you can find for
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Tom, shaking his head dismally,
and chewing rosebuds.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I had known you sooner,
Mr. Harthouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, you see, Tom,&rsquo; said Mr. Harthouse in
conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribution
to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it
wanted to become a part of the mainland: &lsquo;every man is
selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the rest of
my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I am desperately intent;&rsquo; the
languor of his desperation being quite tropical; &lsquo;on your
softening towards your sister&mdash;which you ought to do; and on
your being a more loving and agreeable sort of
brother&mdash;which you ought to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will be, Mr. Harthouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No time like the present, Tom.&nbsp; Begin at
once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I will.&nbsp; And my sister Loo shall say
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having made which bargain, Tom,&rsquo; said Harthouse,
clapping him on the shoulder again, with an air which left him at
liberty to infer&mdash;as he did, poor fool&mdash;that this
condition was imposed upon him in mere careless good nature to
lessen his sense of obligation, &lsquo;we will tear ourselves
asunder until dinner-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Tom appeared before dinner, though his mind seemed heavy
enough, his body was on the alert; and he appeared before Mr.
Bounderby came in.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be cross,
Loo,&rsquo; he said, giving her his hand, and kissing her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I know you are fond of me, and you know I am fond of
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this, there was a smile upon Louisa&rsquo;s face that
day, for some one else.&nbsp; Alas, for some one else!</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the less is the whelp the only creature that
she cares for,&rsquo; thought James Harthouse, reversing the
reflection of his first day&rsquo;s knowledge of her pretty
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;So much the less, so much the less.&rsquo;</p>

136</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EXPLOSION</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning was too bright a
morning for sleep, and James Harthouse rose early, and sat in the
pleasant bay window of his dressing-room, smoking the rare
tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his young
friend.&nbsp; Reposing in the sunlight, with the fragrance of his
eastern pipe about him, and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the
air, so rich and soft with summer odours, he reckoned up his
advantages as an idle winner might count his gains.&nbsp; He was
not at all bored for the time, and could give his mind to it.</p>
<p>He had established a confidence with her, from which her
husband was excluded.&nbsp; He had established a confidence with
her, that absolutely turned upon her indifference towards her
husband, and the absence, now and at all times, of any
congeniality between them.&nbsp; He had artfully, but plainly,
assured her that he knew her heart in its last most delicate
recesses; he had come so near to her through its tenderest
sentiment; he had associated himself with that feeling; and the
barrier behind which she lived, had melted away.&nbsp; All very
odd, and very satisfactory!</p>
<p>And yet he had not, even now, any earnest wickedness of
purpose in him.&nbsp; Publicly and privately, it were much better
for the age in which he lived, that he and the legion of whom he
was one were designedly bad, than indifferent and
purposeless.&nbsp; It is the drifting icebergs setting with any
current anywhere, that wreck the ships.</p>
<p>When the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he goeth about
in a shape by which few but savages and hunters are
attracted.&nbsp; But, when he is trimmed, smoothed, and
varnished, according to the mode; when he is aweary of vice, and
aweary of virtue, used up as to brimstone, and used up as to
bliss; then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or
to the kindling of red fire, he is the very Devil.</p>
<p>So James Harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking,
and reckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he
happened to be travelling.&nbsp; The end to which it led was
before him, pretty plainly; but he troubled himself with no
calculations about it.&nbsp; What will be, will be.</p>
<p>As he had rather a long ride to take that day&mdash;for there
was a public occasion &lsquo;to do&rsquo; at some distance, which
afforded a tolerable opportunity of going in for the Gradgrind
men&mdash;he dressed early and went down to breakfast.&nbsp; He
was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous
evening.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; He resumed where he had left off.&nbsp;
There was a look of interest for him again.</p>
<p>He got through the day as much (or as little) to his own
satisfaction, as was to be expected under the fatiguing
circumstances; and came riding back at six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
There was a sweep of some half-mile between the lodge and the
house, and he was riding along at a foot pace over the smooth
gravel, once Nickits&rsquo;s, when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the
shrubbery, with such violence as to make his horse shy across the
road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harthouse!&rsquo; cried Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you heard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heard what?&rsquo; said Harthouse, soothing his horse,
and inwardly favouring Mr. Bounderby with no good wishes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> heard!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard you, and so has this brute.&nbsp; I have
heard nothing else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the centre of
the path before the horse&rsquo;s head, to explode his bombshell
with more effect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Bank&rsquo;s robbed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robbed last night, sir.&nbsp; Robbed in an
extraordinary manner.&nbsp; Robbed with a false key.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, in his desire to make the most of it, really
seemed mortified by being obliged to reply, &lsquo;Why, no; not
of very much.&nbsp; But it might have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of how much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! as a sum&mdash;if you stick to a sum&mdash;of not
more than a hundred and fifty pound,&rsquo; said Bounderby, with
impatience.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s not the sum; it&rsquo;s
the fact.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the fact of the Bank being robbed,
that&rsquo;s the important circumstance.&nbsp; I am surprised you
don&rsquo;t see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Bounderby,&rsquo; said James, dismounting, and
giving his bridle to his servant, &lsquo;I <i>do</i> see it; and
am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be, by the
spectacle afforded to my mental view.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I may
be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you&mdash;which I do with all
my soul, I assure you&mdash;on your not having sustained a
greater loss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rsquo; replied Bounderby, in a short,
ungracious manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I tell you what.&nbsp; It
might have been twenty thousand pound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose it might.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose it might!&nbsp; By the Lord, you <i>may</i>
suppose so.&nbsp; By George!&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, with
sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
might have been twice twenty.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no knowing what
it would have been, or wouldn&rsquo;t have been, as it was, but
for the fellows&rsquo; being disturbed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa had come up now, and Mrs. Sparsit, and Bitzer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s daughter knows
pretty well what it might have been, if you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo;
blustered Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dropped, sir, as if she was
shot when I told her!&nbsp; Never knew her do such a thing
before.&nbsp; Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my
opinion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She still looked faint and pale.&nbsp; James Harthouse begged
her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her
how the robbery had been committed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I am going to tell you,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you
hadn&rsquo;t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should
have begun to tell you before.&nbsp; You know this lady (for she
<i>is</i> a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have already had the honour&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; And this young man, Bitzer, you saw
him too on the same occasion?&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Harthouse inclined
his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; They live at the Bank.&nbsp; You know
they live at the Bank, perhaps?&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; Yesterday
afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put
away as usual.&nbsp; In the iron room that this young fellow
sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much.&nbsp; In the
little safe in young Tom&rsquo;s closet, the safe used for petty
purposes, there was a hundred and fifty odd pound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,&rsquo; said
Bitzer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel
round upon him, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s have none of <i>your</i>
interruptions.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s enough to be robbed while
you&rsquo;re snoring because you&rsquo;re too comfortable,
without being put right with <i>your</i> four seven ones.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t snore, myself, when I was your age, let me tell
you.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t victuals enough to snore.&nbsp; And I
didn&rsquo;t four seven one.&nbsp; Not if I knew it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and
seemed at once particularly impressed and depressed by the
instance last given of Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s moral
abstinence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hundred and fifty odd pound,&rsquo; resumed Mr.
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;That sum of money, young Tom locked in
his safe, not a very strong safe, but that&rsquo;s no matter
now.&nbsp; Everything was left, all right.&nbsp; Some time in the
night, while this young fellow snored&mdash;Mrs. Sparsit,
ma&rsquo;am, you say you have heard him snore?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;I cannot say
that I have heard him precisely snore, and therefore must not
make that statement.&nbsp; But on winter evenings, when he has
fallen asleep at his table, I have heard him, what I should
prefer to describe as partially choke.&nbsp; I have heard him on
such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be
sometimes heard in Dutch clocks.&nbsp; Not,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, with a lofty sense of giving strict evidence,
&lsquo;that I would convey any imputation on his moral
character.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; I have always considered
Bitzer a young man of the most upright principle; and to that I
beg to bear my testimony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said the exasperated Bounderby,
&lsquo;while he was snoring, <i>or</i> choking, <i>or</i>
Dutch-clocking, <i>or</i> something <i>or</i> other&mdash;being
asleep&mdash;some fellows, somehow, whether previously concealed
in the house or not remains to be seen, got to young Tom&rsquo;s
safe, forced it, and abstracted the contents.&nbsp; Being then
disturbed, they made off; letting themselves out at the main
door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked, and the
key under Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s pillow) with a false key, which
was picked up in the street near the Bank, about twelve
o&rsquo;clock to-day.&nbsp; No alarm takes place, till this chap,
Bitzer, turns out this morning, and begins to open and prepare
the offices for business.&nbsp; Then, looking at Tom&rsquo;s
safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the
money gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Tom, by the by?&rsquo; asked Harthouse,
glancing round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has been helping the police,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;and stays behind at the Bank.&nbsp; I wish these fellows
had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life.&nbsp; They
would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence
in the job; I can tell &rsquo;em that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is anybody suspected?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suspected?&nbsp; I should think there was somebody
suspected.&nbsp; Egod!&rsquo; said Bounderby, relinquishing Mrs.
Sparsit&rsquo;s arm to wipe his heated head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Josiah
Bounderby of Coketown is not to be plundered and nobody
suspected.&nbsp; No, thank you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Might Mr. Harthouse inquire Who was suspected?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Bounderby, stopping and facing about
to confront them all, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not to be mentioned everywhere; it&rsquo;s not to be
mentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned
(there&rsquo;s a gang of &rsquo;em) may be thrown off their
guard.&nbsp; So take this in confidence.&nbsp; Now wait a
bit.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What should you say to;&rsquo; here he violently exploded:
&lsquo;to a Hand being in it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said Harthouse, lazily, &lsquo;not our
friend Blackpot?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say Pool instead of Pot, sir,&rsquo; returned
Bounderby, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s the man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and
surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes!&nbsp; I know!&rsquo; said Bounderby, immediately
catching at the sound.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know!&nbsp; I am used to
that.&nbsp; I know all about it.&nbsp; They are the finest people
in the world, these fellows are.&nbsp; They have got the gift of
the gab, they have.&nbsp; They only want to have their rights
explained to them, they do.&nbsp; But I tell you what.&nbsp; Show
me a dissatisfied Hand, and I&rsquo;ll show you a man
that&rsquo;s fit for anything bad, I don&rsquo;t care what it
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another of the popular fictions of Coketown, which some pains
had been taken to disseminate&mdash;and which some people really
believed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am acquainted with these chaps,&rsquo; said
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can read &rsquo;em off, like
books.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am, I appeal to you.&nbsp;
What warning did I give that fellow, the first time he set foot
in the house, when the express object of his visit was to know
how he could knock Religion over, and floor the Established
Church?&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit, in point of high connexions, you are
on a level with the aristocracy,&mdash;did I say, or did I not
say, to that fellow, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t hide the truth from
me: you are not the kind of fellow I like; you&rsquo;ll come to
no good&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Assuredly, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit,
&lsquo;you did, in a highly impressive manner, give him such an
admonition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he shocked you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bounderby; &lsquo;when he shocked your feelings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a meek
shake of her head, &lsquo;he certainly did so.&nbsp; Though I do
not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such
points&mdash;more foolish if the term is preferred&mdash;than
they might have been, if I had always occupied my present
position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse,
as much as to say, &lsquo;I am the proprietor of this female, and
she&rsquo;s worth your attention, I think.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then,
resumed his discourse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to
him when you saw him.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mince the matter with
him.&nbsp; I am never mealy with &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I <span
class="GutSmall">KNOW</span> &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Very well,
sir.&nbsp; Three days after that, he bolted.&nbsp; Went off,
nobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy&mdash;only
with this difference, that he is a worse subject than my mother,
if possible.&nbsp; What did he do before he went?&nbsp; What do
you say;&rsquo; Mr. Bounderby, with his hat in his hand, gave a
beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences, as
if it were a tambourine; &lsquo;to his being seen&mdash;night
after night&mdash;watching the Bank?&mdash;to his lurking about
there&mdash;after dark?&mdash;To its striking Mrs.
Sparsit&mdash;that he could be lurking for no good&mdash;To her
calling Bitzer&rsquo;s attention to him, and their both taking
notice of him&mdash;And to its appearing on inquiry
to-day&mdash;that he was also noticed by the
neighbours?&rsquo;&nbsp; Having come to the climax, Mr.
Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put his tambourine on his
head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suspicious,&rsquo; said James Harthouse,
&lsquo;certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so, sir,&rsquo; said Bounderby, with a defiant
nod.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think so.&nbsp; But there are more of
&rsquo;em in it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an old woman.&nbsp; One
never hears of these things till the mischief&rsquo;s done; all
sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse
is stolen; there&rsquo;s an old woman turns up now.&nbsp; An old
woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick,
every now and then.&nbsp; <i>She</i> watches the place a whole
day before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him,
she steals away with him and holds a council with him&mdash;I
suppose, to make her report on going off duty, and be damned to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk
from observation, thought Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is not all of &rsquo;em, even as we already know
&rsquo;em,&rsquo; said Bounderby, with many nods of hidden
meaning.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I have said enough for the
present.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have the goodness to keep it quiet,
and mention it to no one.&nbsp; It may take time, but we shall
have &rsquo;em.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s policy to give &rsquo;em line
enough, and there&rsquo;s no objection to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour
of the law, as notice-boards observe,&rsquo; replied James
Harthouse, &lsquo;and serve them right.&nbsp; Fellows who go in
for Banks must take the consequences.&nbsp; If there were no
consequences, we should all go in for Banks.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had
gently taken Louisa&rsquo;s parasol from her hand, and had put it
up for her; and she walked under its shade, though the sun did
not shine there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the present, Loo Bounderby,&rsquo; said her
husband, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s Mrs. Sparsit to look after.&nbsp;
Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s nerves have been acted upon by this
business, and she&rsquo;ll stay here a day or two.&nbsp; So make
her comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you very much, sir,&rsquo; that discreet lady
observed, &lsquo;but pray do not let My comfort be a
consideration.&nbsp; Anything will do for Me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her
association with that domestic establishment, it was that she was
so excessively regardless of herself and regardful of others, as
to be a nuisance.&nbsp; On being shown her chamber, she was so
dreadfully sensible of its comforts as to suggest the inference
that she would have preferred to pass the night on the mangle in
the laundry.&nbsp; True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses were
accustomed to splendour, &lsquo;but it is my duty to
remember,&rsquo; Mrs. Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty
grace: particularly when any of the domestics were present,
&lsquo;that what I was, I am no longer.&nbsp; Indeed,&rsquo; said
she, &lsquo;if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr.
Sparsit was a Powler, or that I myself am related to the Scadgers
family; or if I could even revoke the fact, and make myself a
person of common descent and ordinary connexions; I would gladly
do so.&nbsp; I should think it, under existing circumstances,
right to do so.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same Hermitical state of mind
led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner, until
fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them; when she said,
&lsquo;Indeed you are very good, sir;&rsquo; and departed from a
resolution of which she had made rather formal and public
announcement, to &lsquo;wait for the simple mutton.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt; and,
feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest
extent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves, occasionally
sat back in her chair and silently wept; at which periods a tear
of large dimensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed
(or rather, must be, for it insisted on public notice) sliding
down her Roman nose.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s greatest point, first and last, was
her determination to pity Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; There were
occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily moved to
shake her head, as who would say, &lsquo;Alas, poor
Yorick!&rsquo;&nbsp; After allowing herself to be betrayed into
these evidences of emotion, she would force a lambent brightness,
and would be fitfully cheerful, and would say, &lsquo;You have
still good spirits, sir, I am thankful to find;&rsquo; and would
appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby
bore up as he did.&nbsp; One idiosyncrasy for which she often
apologized, she found it excessively difficult to conquer.&nbsp;
She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby &lsquo;Miss
Gradgrind,&rsquo; and yielded to it some three or four score
times in the course of the evening.&nbsp; Her repetition of this
mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion; but indeed,
she said, it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind: whereas, to
persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the
happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs.
Bounderby, she found almost impossible.&nbsp; It was a further
singularity of this remarkable case, that the more she thought
about it, the more impossible it appeared; &lsquo;the
differences,&rsquo; she observed, &lsquo;being such.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby tried the case
of the robbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the
evidence, found the suspected persons guilty, and sentenced them
to the extreme punishment of the law.&nbsp; That done, Bitzer was
dismissed to town with instructions to recommend Tom to come home
by the mail-train.</p>
<p>When candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be low, sir.&nbsp; Pray let me see you
cheerful, sir, as I used to do.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby, upon
whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making
him, in a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like
some large sea-animal.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot bear to see you so,
sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try a hand at
backgammon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of
living under your roof.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t
played backgammon, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;since that time.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Sparsit, soothingly, &lsquo;I am aware that you have
not.&nbsp; I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes no interest in
the game.&nbsp; But I shall be happy, sir, if you will
condescend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They played near a window, opening on the garden.&nbsp; It was
a fine night: not moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.&nbsp;
Louisa and Mr. Harthouse strolled out into the garden, where
their voices could be heard in the stillness, though not what
they said.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit, from her place at the backgammon
board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the shadows
without.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t
see a Fire, do you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh dear no, sir,&rsquo;
returned Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;I was thinking of the
dew.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What have you got to do with the dew,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
not myself, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;I am
fearful of Miss Gradgrind&rsquo;s taking cold.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;She never takes cold,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Really, sir?&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; And was
affected with a cough in her throat.</p>
<p>When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a
glass of water.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, sir?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not your sherry warm, with lemon-peel and
nutmeg?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, I have got out of the habit of
taking it now, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The more&rsquo;s the pity, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs.
Sparsit; &lsquo;you are losing all your good old habits.&nbsp;
Cheer up, sir!&nbsp; If Miss Gradgrind will permit me, I will
offer to make it for you, as I have often done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything
she pleased, that considerate lady made the beverage, and handed
it to Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will do you good, sir.&nbsp;
It will warm your heart.&nbsp; It is the sort of thing you want,
and ought to take, sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when Mr. Bounderby said,
&lsquo;Your health, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; she answered with great
feeling, &lsquo;Thank you, sir.&nbsp; The same to you, and
happiness also.&rsquo;&nbsp; Finally, she wished him good night,
with great pathos; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed, with a maudlin
persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender, though
he could not, for his life, have mentioned what it was.</p>
<p>Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she watched and
waited for her brother&rsquo;s coming home.&nbsp; That could
hardly be, she knew, until an hour past midnight; but in the
country silence, which did anything but calm the trouble of her
thoughts, time lagged wearily.&nbsp; At last, when the darkness
and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she
heard the bell at the gate.&nbsp; She felt as though she would
have been glad that it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and
the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the
air, and all was dead again.</p>
<p>She waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she judged.&nbsp;
Then she arose, put on a loose robe, and went out of her room in
the dark, and up the staircase to her brother&rsquo;s room.&nbsp;
His door being shut, she softly opened it and spoke to him,
approaching his bed with a noiseless step.</p>
<p>She kneeled down beside it, passed her arm over his neck, and
drew his face to hers.&nbsp; She knew that he only feigned to be
asleep, but she said nothing to him.</p>
<p>He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and
asked who that was, and what was the matter?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom, have you anything to tell me?&nbsp; If ever you
loved me in your life, and have anything concealed from every one
besides, tell it to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Loo.&nbsp; You have
been dreaming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear brother:&rsquo; she laid her head down on his
pillow, and her hair flowed over him as if she would hide him
from every one but herself: &lsquo;is there nothing that you have
to tell me?&nbsp; Is there nothing you can tell me if you
will?&nbsp; You can tell me nothing that will change me.&nbsp; O
Tom, tell me the truth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Loo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you lie here alone, my dear, in the melancholy
night, so you must lie somewhere one night, when even I, if I am
living then, shall have left you.&nbsp; As I am here beside you,
barefoot, unclothed, undistinguishable in darkness, so must I lie
through all the night of my decay, until I am dust.&nbsp; In the
name of that time, Tom, tell me the truth now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it you want to know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be certain;&rsquo; in the energy of her love
she took him to her bosom as if he were a child; &lsquo;that I
will not reproach you.&nbsp; You may be certain that I will be
compassionate and true to you.&nbsp; You may be certain that I
will save you at whatever cost.&nbsp; O Tom, have you nothing to
tell me?&nbsp; Whisper very softly.&nbsp; Say only
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and I shall understand you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned her ear to his lips, but he remained doggedly
silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a word, Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I say Yes, or how can I say No, when I
don&rsquo;t know what you mean?&nbsp; Loo, you are a brave, kind
girl, worthy I begin to think of a better brother than I
am.&nbsp; But I have nothing more to say.&nbsp; Go to bed, go to
bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are tired,&rsquo; she whispered presently, more in
her usual way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am quite tired out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day.&nbsp;
Have any fresh discoveries been made?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only those you have heard of,
from&mdash;him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to
those people, and that we saw those three together?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you yourself particularly ask me
to keep it quiet when you asked me to go there with
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; But I did not know then what was going to
happen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I neither.&nbsp; How could I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was very quick upon her with this retort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ought I to say, after what has happened,&rsquo; said
his sister, standing by the bed&mdash;she had gradually withdrawn
herself and risen, &lsquo;that I made that visit?&nbsp; Should I
say so?&nbsp; Must I say so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Heavens, Loo,&rsquo; returned her brother,
&lsquo;you are not in the habit of asking my advice.&nbsp; Say
what you like.&nbsp; If you keep it to yourself, I shall keep it
to <i>my</i>self.&nbsp; If you disclose it, there&rsquo;s an end
of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was too dark for either to see the other&rsquo;s face; but
each seemed very attentive, and to consider before speaking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is
really implicated in this crime?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why he
shouldn&rsquo;t be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He seemed to me an honest man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another person may seem to you dishonest, and yet not
be so.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a pause, for he had hesitated and
stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In short,&rsquo; resumed Tom, as if he had made up his
mind, &lsquo;if you come to that, perhaps I was so far from being
altogether in his favour, that I took him outside the door to
tell him quietly, that I thought he might consider himself very
well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister, and
that I hoped he would make good use of it.&nbsp; You remember
whether I took him out or not.&nbsp; I say nothing against the
man; he may be a very good fellow, for anything I know; I hope he
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was he offended by what you said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he took it pretty well; he was civil enough.&nbsp;
Where are you, Loo?&rsquo;&nbsp; He sat up in bed and kissed
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good night, my dear, good night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have nothing more to tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; What should I have?&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t
have me tell you a lie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have you do that to-night, Tom, of all
the nights in your life; many and much happier as I hope they
will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, my dear Loo.&nbsp; I am so tired, that I am
sure I wonder I don&rsquo;t say anything to get to sleep.&nbsp;
Go to bed, go to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kissing her again, he turned round, drew the coverlet over his
head, and lay as still as if that time had come by which she had
adjured him.&nbsp; She stood for some time at the bedside before
she slowly moved away.&nbsp; She stopped at the door, looked back
when she had opened it, and asked him if he had called her?&nbsp;
But he lay still, and she softly closed the door and returned to
her room.</p>
<p>Then the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her gone,
crept out of bed, fastened his door, and threw himself upon his
pillow again: tearing his hair, morosely crying, grudgingly
loving her, hatefully but impenitently spurning himself, and no
less hatefully and unprofitably spurning all the good in the
world.</p>

146</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HEARING THE LAST OF IT</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sparsit</span>, lying by to recover
the tone of her nerves in Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s retreat, kept
such a sharp look-out, night and day, under her Coriolanian
eyebrows, that her eyes, like a couple of lighthouses on an
iron-bound coast, might have warned all prudent mariners from
that bold rock her Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in
its neighbourhood, but for the placidity of her manner.&nbsp;
Although it was hard to believe that her retiring for the night
could be anything but a form, so severely wide awake were those
classical eyes of hers, and so impossible did it seem that her
rigid nose could yield to any relaxing influence, yet her manner
of sitting, smoothing her uncomfortable, not to say, gritty
mittens (they were constructed of a cool fabric like a
meat-safe), or of ambling to unknown places of destination with
her foot in her cotton stirrup, was so perfectly serene, that
most observers would have been constrained to suppose her a dove,
embodied by some freak of nature, in the earthly tabernacle of a
bird of the hook-beaked order.</p>
<p>She was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the
house.&nbsp; How she got from story to story was a mystery beyond
solution.&nbsp; A lady so decorous in herself, and so highly
connected, was not to be suspected of dropping over the banisters
or sliding down them, yet her extraordinary facility of
locomotion suggested the wild idea.&nbsp; Another noticeable
circumstance in Mrs. Sparsit was, that she was never
hurried.&nbsp; She would shoot with consummate velocity from the
roof to the hall, yet would be in full possession of her breath
and dignity on the moment of her arrival there.&nbsp; Neither was
she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace.</p>
<p>She took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse, and had some pleasant
conversation with him soon after her arrival.&nbsp; She made him
her stately curtsey in the garden, one morning before
breakfast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It appears but yesterday, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, &lsquo;that I had the honour of receiving you at the
Bank, when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with
Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s address.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself
in the course of Ages,&rsquo; said Mr. Harthouse, inclining his
head to Mrs. Sparsit with the most indolent of all possible
airs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We live in a singular world, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I am
proud, to have made a remark, similar in effect, though not so
epigrammatically expressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A singular world, I would say, sir,&rsquo; pursued Mrs.
Sparsit; after acknowledging the compliment with a drooping of
her dark eyebrows, not altogether so mild in its expression as
her voice was in its dulcet tones; &lsquo;as regards the
intimacies we form at one time, with individuals we were quite
ignorant of, at another.&nbsp; I recall, sir, that on that
occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive
of Miss Gradgrind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance
deserves.&nbsp; I availed myself of your obliging hints to
correct my timidity, and it is unnecessary to add that they were
perfectly accurate.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s talent
for&mdash;in fact for anything requiring accuracy&mdash;with a
combination of strength of mind&mdash;and Family&mdash;is too
habitually developed to admit of any question.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took him so
long to get through, and his mind wandered so much in the course
of its execution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You found Miss Gradgrind&mdash;I really cannot call her
Mrs. Bounderby; it&rsquo;s very absurd of me&mdash;as youthful as
I described her?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You drew her portrait perfectly,&rsquo; said Mr.
Harthouse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Presented her dead image.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very engaging, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, causing
her mittens slowly to revolve over one another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Highly so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It used to be considered,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit,
&lsquo;that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I
confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in
that respect.&nbsp; Ay, and indeed here <i>is</i> Mr.
Bounderby!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great
many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one
else.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you find yourself this morning,
sir?&nbsp; Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and
lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the
effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs.
Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife
downward.&nbsp; So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness
of heart, &lsquo;You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say
Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,&rsquo;
Mr. Bounderby replied, &lsquo;If I waited to be taken care of by
my wife, ma&rsquo;am, I believe you know pretty well I should
wait till Doomsday, so I&rsquo;ll trouble <i>you</i> to take
charge of the teapot.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit complied, and
assumed her old position at table.</p>
<p>This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental.&nbsp;
She was so humble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose,
protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under
existing circumstances, often as she had had the honour of making
Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s breakfast, before Mrs. Gradgrind&mdash;she
begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby&mdash;she hoped to
be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though she
trusted to become familiar with it by and by&mdash;had assumed
her present position.&nbsp; It was only (she observed) because
Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s time was so very precious, and she knew it of
old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment,
that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request;
long as his will had been a law to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; Stop where you are, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
said Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;stop where you are!&nbsp; Mrs.
Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I
believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs.
Sparsit, almost with severity, &lsquo;because that is very unkind
to Mrs. Bounderby.&nbsp; And to be unkind is not to be you,
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may set your mind at rest, ma&rsquo;am.&mdash;You
can take it very quietly, can&rsquo;t you, Loo?&rsquo; said Mr.
Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; It is of no moment.&nbsp; Why should
it be of any importance to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs.
Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a
sense of slight.&nbsp; &lsquo;You attach too much importance to
these things, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; By George, you&rsquo;ll be
corrupted in some of your notions here.&nbsp; You are
old-fashioned, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; You are behind Tom
Gradgrind&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter with you?&rsquo; asked Louisa,
coldly surprised.&nbsp; &lsquo;What has given you
offence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Offence!&rsquo; repeated Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you
suppose if there was any offence given me, I shouldn&rsquo;t name
it, and request to have it corrected?&nbsp; I am a
straightforward man, I believe.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t go beating
about for side-winds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too
diffident, or too delicate,&rsquo; Louisa answered him
composedly: &lsquo;I have never made that objection to you,
either as a child or as a woman.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand
what you would have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have?&rsquo; returned Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing.&nbsp; Otherwise, don&rsquo;t you, Loo Bounderby,
know thoroughly well that I, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, would
have it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups
ring, with a proud colour in her face that was a new change, Mr.
Harthouse thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are incomprehensible this
morning,&rsquo; said Louisa.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray take no further
trouble to explain yourself.&nbsp; I am not curious to know your
meaning.&nbsp; What does it matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said on this theme, and Mr. Harthouse was
soon idly gay on indifferent subjects.&nbsp; But from this day,
the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby threw Louisa and James
Harthouse more together, and strengthened the dangerous
alienation from her husband and confidence against him with
another, into which she had fallen by degrees so fine that she
could not retrace them if she tried.&nbsp; But whether she ever
tried or no, lay hidden in her own closed heart.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion,
that, assisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after breakfast, and
being then alone with him in the hall, she imprinted a chaste
kiss upon his hand, murmured &lsquo;My benefactor!&rsquo; and
retired, overwhelmed with grief.&nbsp; Yet it is an indubitable
fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five minutes
after he had left the house in the self-same hat, the same
descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the
Powlers, shook her right-hand mitten at his portrait, made a
contemptuous grimace at that work of art, and said &lsquo;Serve
you right, you Noodle, and I am glad of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone, when Bitzer
appeared.&nbsp; Bitzer had come down by train, shrieking and
rattling over the long line of arches that bestrode the wild
country of past and present coal-pits, with an express from Stone
Lodge.&nbsp; It was a hasty note to inform Louisa that Mrs.
Gradgrind lay very ill.&nbsp; She had never been well within her
daughter&rsquo;s knowledge; but, she had declined within the last
few days, had continued sinking all through the night, and was
now as nearly dead, as her limited capacity of being in any state
that implied the ghost of an intention to get out of it,
allowed.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless
servitor at Death&rsquo;s door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked,
Louisa rumbled to Coketown, over the coal-pits past and present,
and was whirled into its smoky jaws.&nbsp; She dismissed the
messenger to his own devices, and rode away to her old home.</p>
<p>She had seldom been there since her marriage.&nbsp; Her father
was usually sifting and sifting at his parliamentary cinder-heap
in London (without being observed to turn up many precious
articles among the rubbish), and was still hard at it in the
national dust-yard.&nbsp; Her mother had taken it rather as a
disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she reclined upon
her sofa; young people, Louisa felt herself all unfit for; Sissy
she had never softened to again, since the night when the
stroller&rsquo;s child had raised her eyes to look at Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s intended wife.&nbsp; She had no inducements to
go back, and had rarely gone.</p>
<p>Neither, as she approached her old home now, did any of the
best influences of old home descend upon her.&nbsp; The dreams of
childhood&mdash;its airy fables; its graceful, beautiful, humane,
impossible adornments of the world beyond: so good to be believed
in once, so good to be remembered when outgrown, for then the
least among them rises to the stature of a great Charity in the
heart, suffering little children to come into the midst of it,
and to keep with their pure hands a garden in the stony ways of
this world, wherein it were better for all the children of Adam
that they should oftener sun themselves, simple and trustful, and
not worldly-wise&mdash;what had she to do with these?&nbsp;
Remembrances of how she had journeyed to the little that she
knew, by the enchanted roads of what she and millions of innocent
creatures had hoped and imagined; of how, first coming upon
Reason through the tender light of Fancy, she had seen it a
beneficent god, deferring to gods as great as itself; not a grim
Idol, cruel and cold, with its victims bound hand to foot, and
its big dumb shape set up with a sightless stare, never to be
moved by anything but so many calculated tons of
leverage&mdash;what had she to do with these?&nbsp; Her
remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the
drying up of every spring and fountain in her young heart as it
gushed out.&nbsp; The golden waters were not there.&nbsp; They
were flowing for the fertilization of the land where grapes are
gathered from thorns, and figs from thistles.</p>
<p>She went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into
the house and into her mother&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Since the time
of her leaving home, Sissy had lived with the rest of the family
on equal terms.&nbsp; Sissy was at her mother&rsquo;s side; and
Jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in the
room.</p>
<p>There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs.
Gradgrind that her eldest child was there.&nbsp; She reclined,
propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as nearly in her old
usual attitude, as anything so helpless could be kept in.&nbsp;
She had positively refused to take to her bed; on the ground that
if she did, she would never hear the last of it.</p>
<p>Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls,
and the sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such
a long time in getting down to her ears, that she might have been
lying at the bottom of a well.&nbsp; The poor lady was nearer
Truth than she ever had been: which had much to do with it.</p>
<p>On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at
cross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since
he married Louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable
name, she had called him J; and that she could not at present
depart from that regulation, not being yet provided with a
permanent substitute.&nbsp; Louisa had sat by her for some
minutes, and had spoken to her often, before she arrived at a
clear understanding who it was.&nbsp; She then seemed to come to
it all at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Gradgrind, &lsquo;and I
hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself.&nbsp; It was
all your father&rsquo;s doing.&nbsp; He set his heart upon
it.&nbsp; And he ought to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to hear of you, mother; not of
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You want to hear of me, my dear?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
something new, I am sure, when anybody wants to hear of me.&nbsp;
Not at all well, Louisa.&nbsp; Very faint and giddy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you in pain, dear mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s a pain somewhere in the
room,&rsquo; said Mrs. Gradgrind, &lsquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t
positively say that I have got it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this strange speech, she lay silent for some time.&nbsp;
Louisa, holding her hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it,
could see a slight thin thread of life in fluttering motion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You very seldom see your sister,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;She grows like you.&nbsp; I wish you
would look at her.&nbsp; Sissy, bring her here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was brought, and stood with her hand in her
sister&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Louisa had observed her with her arm round
Sissy&rsquo;s neck, and she felt the difference of this
approach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you see the likeness, Louisa?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, mother.&nbsp; I should think her like me.&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh!&nbsp; Yes, I always say so,&rsquo; Mrs. Gradgrind
cried, with unexpected quickness.&nbsp; &lsquo;And that reminds
me.&nbsp; I&mdash;I want to speak to you, my dear.&nbsp; Sissy,
my good girl, leave us alone a minute.&rsquo; Louisa had
relinquished the hand: had thought that her sister&rsquo;s was a
better and brighter face than hers had ever been: had seen in it,
not without a rising feeling of resentment, even in that place
and at that time, something of the gentleness of the other face
in the room; the sweet face with the trusting eyes, made paler
than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich dark hair.</p>
<p>Left alone with her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful
lull upon her face, like one who was floating away upon some
great water, all resistance over, content to be carried down the
stream.&nbsp; She put the shadow of a hand to her lips again, and
recalled her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were going to speak to me, mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&nbsp; Yes, to be sure, my dear.&nbsp; You know your
father is almost always away now, and therefore I must write to
him about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About what, mother?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be
troubled.&nbsp; About what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said
anything, on any subject, I have never heard the last of it: and
consequently, that I have long left off saying
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&lsquo;I can hear you, mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, it was
only by dint of bending down to her ear, and at the same time
attentively watching the lips as they moved, that she could link
such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your
brother.&nbsp; Ologies of all kinds from morning to night.&nbsp;
If there is any Ology left, of any description, that has not been
worn to rags in this house, all I can say is, I hope I shall
never hear its name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go
on.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, to keep her from floating away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there is something&mdash;not an Ology at
all&mdash;that your father has missed, or forgotten,
Louisa.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what it is.&nbsp; I have often
sat with Sissy near me, and thought about it.&nbsp; I shall never
get its name now.&nbsp; But your father may.&nbsp; It makes me
restless.&nbsp; I want to write to him, to find out for
God&rsquo;s sake, what it is.&nbsp; Give me a pen, give me a
pen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even the power of restlessness was gone, except from the poor
head, which could just turn from side to side.</p>
<p>She fancied, however, that her request had been complied with,
and that the pen she could not have held was in her hand.&nbsp;
It matters little what figures of wonderful no-meaning she began
to trace upon her wrappers.&nbsp; The hand soon stopped in the
midst of them; the light that had always been feeble and dim
behind the weak transparency, went out; and even Mrs. Gradgrind,
emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth
himself in vain, took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages
and patriarchs.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MRS. SPARSIT&rsquo;S STAIRCASE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s</span> nerves being
slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman made a stay of some
weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s retreat, where,
notwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her
becoming consciousness of her altered station, she resigned
herself with noble fortitude to lodging, as one may say, in
clover, and feeding on the fat of the land.&nbsp; During the
whole term of this recess from the guardianship of the Bank, Mrs.
Sparsit was a pattern of consistency; continuing to take such
pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face, as is rarely taken on man, and
to call his portrait a Noodle to <i>its</i> face, with the
greatest acrimony and contempt.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition
that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he
had that general cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not
yet settled what it was), and further that Louisa would have
objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with
his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do,
resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.&nbsp; So when
her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming
sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on
the day before her departure, &lsquo;I tell you what,
ma&rsquo;am; you shall come down here of a Saturday, while the
fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which
Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan
persuasion: &lsquo;To hear is to obey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an
idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head.&nbsp;
Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of her
impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs.
Sparsit&rsquo;s edge, must have given her as it were a lift, in
the way of inspiration.&nbsp; She erected in her mind a mighty
Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and
down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw
Louisa coming.</p>
<p>It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s life, to look
up at her staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.&nbsp;
Sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, sometimes several steps at
one bout, sometimes stopping, never turning back.&nbsp; If she
had once turned back, it might have been the death of Mrs.
Sparsit in spleen and grief.</p>
<p>She had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day,
when Mr. Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded
above.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit was in good spirits, and inclined to be
conversational.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray, sir,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;if I may venture
to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show
reserve&mdash;which is indeed hardy in me, for I well know you
have a reason for everything you do&mdash;have you received
intelligence respecting the robbery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, no; not yet.&nbsp; Under the
circumstances, I didn&rsquo;t expect it yet.&nbsp; Rome
wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very true, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her
head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor yet in a week, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a
gentle melancholy upon her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a similar manner, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, &lsquo;I can wait, you know.&nbsp; If Romulus and
Remus could wait, Josiah Bounderby can wait.&nbsp; They were
better off in their youth than I was, however.&nbsp; They had a
she-wolf for a nurse; I had only a she-wolf for a
grandmother.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t give any milk, ma&rsquo;am;
she gave bruises.&nbsp; She was a regular Alderney at
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; continued Bounderby, &lsquo;I
have not heard anything more about it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s in hand,
though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business at
present&mdash;something new for him; he hadn&rsquo;t the
schooling <i>I</i> had&mdash;is helping.&nbsp; My injunction is,
Keep it quiet, and let it seem to blow over.&nbsp; Do what you
like under the rose, but don&rsquo;t give a sign of what
you&rsquo;re about; or half a hundred of &rsquo;em will combine
together and get this fellow who has bolted, out of reach for
good.&nbsp; Keep it quiet, and the thieves will grow in
confidence by little and little, and we shall have
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very sagacious indeed, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very interesting.&nbsp; The old woman you
mentioned, sir&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old woman I mentioned, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, cutting the matter short, as it was nothing to boast
about, &lsquo;is not laid hold of; but, she may take her oath she
will be, if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old
mind.&nbsp; In the mean time, ma&rsquo;am, I am of opinion, if
you ask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her chamber window, resting
from her packing operations, looked towards her great staircase
and saw Louisa still descending.</p>
<p>She sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking
very low; he stood leaning over her, as they whispered together,
and his face almost touched her hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;If not
quite!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, straining her hawk&rsquo;s eyes
to the utmost.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a word
of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking
softly, otherwise than from the expression of their figures; but
what they said was this:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, perfectly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His face, and his manner, and what he said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; And an infinitely dreary person he
appeared to me to be.&nbsp; Lengthy and prosy in the
extreme.&nbsp; It was knowing to hold forth, in the humble-virtue
school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought at the time,
&ldquo;My good fellow, you are over-doing this!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Louisa&mdash;as Tom says.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which he
never did say.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know no good of the
fellow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor of any other such person?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I,&rsquo; she returned, with more of her first
manner on her than he had lately seen, &lsquo;when I know nothing
of them, men or women?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive
representation of your devoted friend, who knows something of
several varieties of his excellent fellow-creatures&mdash;for
excellent they are, I am quite ready to believe, in spite of such
little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get
hold of.&nbsp; This fellow talks.&nbsp; Well; every fellow
talks.&nbsp; He professes morality.&nbsp; Well; all sorts of
humbugs profess morality.&nbsp; From the House of Commons to the
House of Correction, there is a general profession of morality,
except among our people; it really is that exception which makes
our people quite reviving.&nbsp; You saw and heard the
case.&nbsp; Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up
extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby&mdash;who, as
we know, is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so
tight a hand.&nbsp; The member of the fluffy classes was injured,
exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody who proposed
to him to go in for some share in this Bank business, went in,
put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and
relieved his mind extremely.&nbsp; Really he would have been an
uncommon, instead of a common, fellow, if he had not availed
himself of such an opportunity.&nbsp; Or he may have originated
it altogether, if he had the cleverness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,&rsquo;
returned Louisa, after sitting thoughtful awhile, &lsquo;to be so
ready to agree with you, and to be so lightened in my heart by
what you say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse.&nbsp; I
have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once&mdash;of
course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom&mdash;and
he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his.&nbsp; Will you
walk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct
in the twilight&mdash;she leaning on his arm&mdash;and she little
thought how she was going down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s
staircase.</p>
<p>Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing.&nbsp; When
Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it
might fall in upon her if it would; but, until then, there it was
to be, a Building, before Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; And
there Louisa always was, upon it.</p>
<p>And always gliding down, down, down!</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him
here and there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied;
she, too, remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and
when it cleared; she kept her black eyes wide open, with no touch
of pity, with no touch of compunction, all absorbed in
interest.&nbsp; In the interest of seeing her, ever drawing, with
no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new
Giant&rsquo;s Staircase.</p>
<p>With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as
contradistinguished from his portrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the
smallest intention of interrupting the descent.&nbsp; Eager to
see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for the last
fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her
hopes.&nbsp; Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon
the stairs; and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten
(with her fist in it), at the figure coming down.</p>
<h3><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LOWER AND LOWER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> figure descended the great
stairs, steadily, steadily; always verging, like a weight in deep
water, to the black gulf at the bottom.</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife&rsquo;s decease, made an
expedition from London, and buried her in a business-like
manner.&nbsp; He then returned with promptitude to the national
cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the odds and ends he
wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes of other
people who wanted other odds and ends&mdash;in fact resumed his
parliamentary duties.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and
ward.&nbsp; Separated from her staircase, all the week, by the
length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house, she
yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her
husband, through her brother, through James Harthouse, through
the outsides of letters and packets, through everything animate
and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Your foot on the last step, my lady,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, apostrophizing the descending figure, with the aid of
her threatening mitten, &lsquo;and all your art shall never blind
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Art or nature though, the original stock of Louisa&rsquo;s
character or the graft of circumstances upon it,&mdash;her
curious reserve did baffle, while it stimulated, one as sagacious
as Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp; There were times when Mr. James Harthouse
was not sure of her.&nbsp; There were times when he could not
read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl
was a greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a
ring of satellites to help her.</p>
<p>So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was
called away from home by business which required his presence
elsewhere, for three or four days.&nbsp; It was on a Friday that
he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank, adding: &lsquo;But
you&rsquo;ll go down to-morrow, ma&rsquo;am, all the same.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll go down just as if I was there.&nbsp; It will make
no difference to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully,
&lsquo;let me beg you not to say that.&nbsp; Your absence will
make a vast difference to me, sir, as I think you very well
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, then you must get on in my absence
as well as you can,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby, not
displeased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Sparsit,
&lsquo;your will is to me a law, sir; otherwise, it might be my
inclination to dispute your kind commands, not feeling sure that
it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me, as
it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.&nbsp; But you
shall say no more, sir.&nbsp; I will go, upon your
invitation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, when I invite you to my house, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
said Bounderby, opening his eyes, &lsquo;I should hope you want
no other invitation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;I
should hope not.&nbsp; Say no more, sir.&nbsp; I would, sir, I
could see you gay again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; blustered
Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;there was
wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss.&nbsp; Be
buoyant, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult
adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could only
scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and
afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully
the small fry of business all the morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bitzer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when
her patron was gone on his journey, and the Bank was closing,
&lsquo;present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him if
he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup,
with a glass of India ale?&rsquo;&nbsp; Young Mr. Thomas being
usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious
answer, and followed on its heels.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Thomas,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;these plain viands being
on table, I thought you might be tempted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, Mrs. Sparsit,&rsquo; said the
whelp.&nbsp; And gloomily fell to.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Sparsit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where may he be at present?&rsquo; Mrs. Sparsit asked
in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the
whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is shooting in Yorkshire,&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church,
yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The kind of gentleman, now,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit,
sweetly, &lsquo;whom one might wager to be a good
shot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Crack,&rsquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this
characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his
eyes to any face for three seconds together.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit
consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were
so inclined.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;as indeed he is of most people.&nbsp; May we
expect to see him again shortly, Mr. Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, <i>I</i> expect to see him to-morrow,&rsquo;
returned the whelp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good news!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the
evening at the station here,&rsquo; said Tom, &lsquo;and I am
going to dine with him afterwards, I believe.&nbsp; He is not
coming down to the country house for a week or so, being due
somewhere else.&nbsp; At least, he says so; but I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if he was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which reminds me!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Would you remember a message to your sister, Mr. Tom, if I
was to charge you with one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try,&rsquo; returned the
reluctant whelp, &lsquo;if it isn&rsquo;t a long un.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is merely my respectful compliments,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;and I fear I may not trouble her with my
society this week; being still a little nervous, and better
perhaps by my poor self.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; observed Tom,
&lsquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t much matter, even if I was to forget it,
for Loo&rsquo;s not likely to think of you unless she sees
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having paid for his entertainment with this agreeable
compliment, he relapsed into a hangdog silence until there was no
more India ale left, when he said, &lsquo;Well, Mrs. Sparsit, I
must be off!&rsquo; and went off.</p>
<p>Next day, Saturday, Mrs. Sparsit sat at her window all day
long looking at the customers coming in and out, watching the
postmen, keeping an eye on the general traffic of the street,
revolving many things in her mind, but, above all, keeping her
attention on her staircase.&nbsp; The evening come, she put on
her bonnet and shawl, and went quietly out: having her reasons
for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a
passenger would arrive from Yorkshire, and for preferring to peep
into it round pillars and corners, and out of ladies&rsquo;
waiting-room windows, to appearing in its precincts openly.</p>
<p>Tom was in attendance, and loitered about until the expected
train came in.&nbsp; It brought no Mr. Harthouse.&nbsp; Tom
waited until the crowd had dispersed, and the bustle was over;
and then referred to a posted list of trains, and took counsel
with porters.&nbsp; That done, he strolled away idly, stopping in
the street and looking up it and down it, and lifting his hat off
and putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and
exhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in
one who had still to wait until the next train should come in, an
hour and forty minutes hence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a device to keep him out of the way,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Sparsit, starting from the dull office window whence
she had watched him last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Harthouse is with his
sister now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the conception of an inspired moment, and she shot off
with her utmost swiftness to work it out.&nbsp; The station for
the country house was at the opposite end of the town, the time
was short, the road not easy; but she was so quick in pouncing on
a disengaged coach, so quick in darting out of it, producing her
money, seizing her ticket, and diving into the train, that she
was borne along the arches spanning the land of coal-pits past
and present, as if she had been caught up in a cloud and whirled
away.</p>
<p>All the journey, immovable in the air though never left
behind; plain to the dark eyes of her mind, as the electric wires
which ruled a colossal strip of music-paper out of the evening
sky, were plain to the dark eyes of her body; Mrs. Sparsit saw
her staircase, with the figure coming down.&nbsp; Very near the
bottom now.&nbsp; Upon the brink of the abyss.</p>
<p>An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath
its drooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass
down the wooden steps of the little station into a stony road,
cross it into a green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth
of leaves and branches.&nbsp; One or two late birds sleepily
chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily crossing and
recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust
that felt like velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until
she very softly closed a gate.</p>
<p>She went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and
went round it, peeping between the leaves at the lower
windows.&nbsp; Most of them were open, as they usually were in
such warm weather, but there were no lights yet, and all was
silent.&nbsp; She tried the garden with no better effect.&nbsp;
She thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long
grass and briers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the
creeping things that be.&nbsp; With her dark eyes and her hook
nose warily in advance of her, Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her
way through the thick undergrowth, so intent upon her object that
she probably would have done no less, if the wood had been a wood
of adders.</p>
<p>Hark!</p>
<p>The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests,
fascinated by the glittering of Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s eyes in the
gloom, as she stopped and listened.</p>
<p>Low voices close at hand.&nbsp; His voice and hers.&nbsp; The
appointment <i>was</i> a device to keep the brother away!&nbsp;
There they were yonder, by the felled tree.</p>
<p>Bending low among the dewy grass, Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer
to them.&nbsp; She drew herself up, and stood behind a tree, like
Robinson Crusoe in his ambuscade against the savages; so near to
them that at a spring, and that no great one, she could have
touched them both.&nbsp; He was there secretly, and had not shown
himself at the house.&nbsp; He had come on horseback, and must
have passed through the neighbouring fields; for his horse was
tied to the meadow side of the fence, within a few paces.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dearest love,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what could I
do?&nbsp; Knowing you were alone, was it possible that I could
stay away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may hang your head, to make yourself the more
attractive; <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know what they see in you when
you hold it up,&rsquo; thought Mrs. Sparsit; &lsquo;but you
little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That she hung her head, was certain.&nbsp; She urged him to go
away, she commanded him to go away; but she neither turned her
face to him, nor raised it.&nbsp; Yet it was remarkable that she
sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her
sit, at any period in her life.&nbsp; Her hands rested in one
another, like the hands of a statue; and even her manner of
speaking was not hurried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear child,&rsquo; said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw
with delight that his arm embraced her; &lsquo;will you not bear
with my society for a little while?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where, Louisa?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we have so little time to make so much of, and I
have come so far, and am altogether so devoted, and
distracted.&nbsp; There never was a slave at once so devoted and
ill-used by his mistress.&nbsp; To look for your sunny welcome
that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen
manner, is heart-rending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we must meet, my dear Louisa.&nbsp; Where shall we
meet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They both started.&nbsp; The listener started, guiltily, too;
for she thought there was another listener among the trees.&nbsp;
It was only rain, beginning to fall fast, in heavy drops.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence,
innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be
charmed to receive me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed; though
I am the most unfortunate fellow in the world, I believe, to have
been insensible to all other women, and to have fallen prostrate
at last under the foot of the most beautiful, and the most
engaging, and the most imperious.&nbsp; My dearest Louisa, I
cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of your
power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and
heard him then and there, within her (Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s)
greedy hearing, tell her how he loved her, and how she was the
stake for which he ardently desired to play away all that he had
in life.&nbsp; The objects he had lately pursued, turned
worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he
flung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with
her.&nbsp; Its pursuit, nevertheless, if it kept him near her, or
its renunciation if it took him from her, or flight if she shared
it, or secrecy if she commanded it, or any fate, or every fate,
all was alike to him, so that she was true to him,&mdash;the man
who had seen how cast away she was, whom she had inspired at
their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of which he
had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her
confidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.&nbsp; All
this, and more, in his hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her
own gratified malice, in the dread of being discovered, in the
rapidly increasing noise of heavy rain among the leaves, and a
thunderstorm rolling up&mdash;Mrs. Sparsit received into her
mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of confusion and
indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the fence and led
his horse away, she was not sure where they were to meet, or
when, except that they had said it was to be that night.</p>
<p>But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and
while she tracked that one she must be right.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, my
dearest love,&rsquo; thought Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;you little
think how well attended you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her enter the
house.&nbsp; What to do next?&nbsp; It rained now, in a sheet of
water.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s white stockings were of many
colours, green predominating; prickly things were in her shoes;
caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own making,
from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and
her Roman nose.&nbsp; In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood
hidden in the density of the shrubbery, considering what
next?</p>
<p>Lo, Louisa coming out of the house!&nbsp; Hastily cloaked and
muffled, and stealing away.&nbsp; She elopes!&nbsp; She falls
from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf.</p>
<p>Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined
step, she struck into a side-path parallel with the ride.&nbsp;
Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short
distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going
quickly through the umbrageous darkness.</p>
<p>When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs.
Sparsit stopped.&nbsp; When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went
on.&nbsp; She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from
the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden
steps to the railroad.&nbsp; A train for Coketown would come
through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown
to be her first place of destination.</p>
<p>In Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s limp and streaming state, no extensive
precautions were necessary to change her usual appearance; but,
she stopped under the lee of the station wall, tumbled her shawl
into a new shape, and put it on over her bonnet.&nbsp; So
disguised she had no fear of being recognized when she followed
up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small
office.&nbsp; Louisa sat waiting in a corner.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit
sat waiting in another corner.&nbsp; Both listened to the
thunder, which was loud, and to the rain, as it washed off the
roof, and pattered on the parapets of the arches.&nbsp; Two or
three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw the
lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron
tracks.</p>
<p>The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually
deepening to a complaint of the heart, announced the train.&nbsp;
Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a
bell, and a shriek; Louisa put into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit
put into another: the little station a desert speck in the
thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold, Mrs.
Sparsit exulted hugely.&nbsp; The figure had plunged down the
precipice, and she felt herself, as it were, attending on the
body.&nbsp; Could she, who had been so active in the getting up
of the funeral triumph, do less than exult?&nbsp; &lsquo;She will
be at Coketown long before him,&rsquo; thought Mrs. Sparsit,
&lsquo;though his horse is never so good.&nbsp; Where will she
wait for him?&nbsp; And where will they go together?&nbsp;
Patience.&nbsp; We shall see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion, when the
train stopped at its destination.&nbsp; Gutters and pipes had
burst, drains had overflowed, and streets were under water.&nbsp;
In the first instant of alighting, Mrs. Sparsit turned her
distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which were in great
request.&nbsp; &lsquo;She will get into one,&rsquo; she
considered, &lsquo;and will be away before I can follow in
another.&nbsp; At all risks of being run over, I must see the
number, and hear the order given to the coachman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation.&nbsp; Louisa
got into no coach, and was already gone.&nbsp; The black eyes
kept upon the railroad-carriage in which she had travelled,
settled upon it a moment too late.&nbsp; The door not being
opened after several minutes, Mrs. Sparsit passed it and repassed
it, saw nothing, looked in, and found it empty.&nbsp; Wet through
and through: with her feet squelching and squashing in her shoes
whenever she moved; with a rash of rain upon her classical
visage; with a bonnet like an over-ripe fig; with all her clothes
spoiled; with damp impressions of every button, string, and
hook-and-eye she wore, printed off upon her highly connected
back; with a stagnant verdure on her general exterior, such as
accumulates on an old park fence in a mouldy lane; Mrs. Sparsit
had no resource but to burst into tears of bitterness and say,
&lsquo;I have lost her!&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">DOWN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> national dustmen, after
entertaining one another with a great many noisy little fights
among themselves, had dispersed for the present, and Mr.
Gradgrind was at home for the vacation.</p>
<p>He sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock,
proving something no doubt&mdash;probably, in the main, that the
Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist.&nbsp; The noise of the rain
did not disturb him much; but it attracted his attention
sufficiently to make him raise his head sometimes, as if he were
rather remonstrating with the elements.&nbsp; When it thundered
very loudly, he glanced towards Coketown, having it in his mind
that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning.</p>
<p>The thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was
pouring down like a deluge, when the door of his room
opened.&nbsp; He looked round the lamp upon his table, and saw,
with amazement, his eldest daughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, I want to speak to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&nbsp; How strange you look!&nbsp;
And good Heaven,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, wondering more and
more, &lsquo;have you come here exposed to this storm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put her hands to her dress, as if she hardly knew.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she uncovered her head, and letting
her cloak and hood fall where they might, stood looking at him:
so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and despairing, that he
was afraid of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&nbsp; I conjure you, Louisa, tell me what
is the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She dropped into a chair before him, and put her cold hand on
his arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, you have trained me from my cradle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I curse the hour in which I was born to such a
destiny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her in doubt and dread, vacantly repeating:
&lsquo;Curse the hour?&nbsp; Curse the hour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you give me life, and take from me all the
inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious
death?&nbsp; Where are the graces of my soul?&nbsp; Where are the
sentiments of my heart?&nbsp; What have you done, O father, what
have you done, with the garden that should have bloomed once, in
this great wilderness here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She struck herself with both her hands upon her bosom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it had ever been here, its ashes alone would save me
from the void in which my whole life sinks.&nbsp; I did not mean
to say this; but, father, you remember the last time we conversed
in this room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now, that
it was with difficulty he answered, &lsquo;Yes,
Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has risen to my lips now, would have risen to my
lips then, if you had given me a moment&rsquo;s help.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t reproach you, father.&nbsp; What you have never
nurtured in me, you have never nurtured in yourself; but O! if
you had only done so long ago, or if you had only neglected me,
what a much better and much happier creature I should have been
this day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this, after all his care, he bowed his head upon
his hand and groaned aloud.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, if you had known, when we were last together
here, what even I feared while I strove against it&mdash;as it
has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural
prompting that has arisen in my heart; if you had known that
there lingered in my breast, sensibilities, affections,
weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength, defying all
the calculations ever made by man, and no more known to his
arithmetic than his Creator is,&mdash;would you have given me to
the husband whom I am now sure that I hate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said, &lsquo;No.&nbsp; No, my poor child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and
blight that have hardened and spoiled me?&nbsp; Would you have
robbed me&mdash;for no one&rsquo;s enrichment&mdash;only for the
greater desolation of this world&mdash;of the immaterial part of
my life, the spring and summer of my belief, my refuge from what
is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in
which I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting
with them, and to hope in my little sphere to make them
better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no.&nbsp; No, Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet, father, if I had been stone blind; if I had groped
my way by my sense of touch, and had been free, while I knew the
shapes and surfaces of things, to exercise my fancy somewhat, in
regard to them; I should have been a million times wiser,
happier, more loving, more contented, more innocent and human in
all good respects, than I am with the eyes I have.&nbsp; Now,
hear what I have come to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He moved, to support her with his arm.&nbsp; She rising as he
did so, they stood close together: she, with a hand upon his
shoulder, looking fixedly in his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With a hunger and thirst upon me, father, which have
never been for a moment appeased; with an ardent impulse towards
some region where rules, and figures, and definitions were not
quite absolute; I have grown up, battling every inch of my
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never knew you were unhappy, my child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, I always knew it.&nbsp; In this strife I have
almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon.&nbsp;
What I have learned has left me doubting, misbelieving,
despising, regretting, what I have not learned; and my dismal
resource has been to think that life would soon go by, and that
nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a
contest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you so young, Louisa!&rsquo; he said with pity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I so young.&nbsp; In this condition,
father&mdash;for I show you now, without fear or favour, the
ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it&mdash;you
proposed my husband to me.&nbsp; I took him.&nbsp; I never made a
pretence to him or you that I loved him.&nbsp; I knew, and,
father, you knew, and he knew, that I never did.&nbsp; I was not
wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful
to Tom.&nbsp; I made that wild escape into something visionary,
and have slowly found out how wild it was.&nbsp; But Tom had been
the subject of all the little tenderness of my life; perhaps he
became so because I knew so well how to pity him.&nbsp; It
matters little now, except as it may dispose you to think more
leniently of his errors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As her father held her in his arms, she put her other hand
upon his other shoulder, and still looking fixedly in his face,
went on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I was irrevocably married, there rose up into
rebellion against the tie, the old strife, made fiercer by all
those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual
natures, and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for
me, father, until they shall be able to direct the anatomist
where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa!&rsquo; he said, and said imploringly; for he
well remembered what had passed between them in their former
interview.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not reproach you, father, I make no
complaint.&nbsp; I am here with another object.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can I do, child?&nbsp; Ask me what you
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am coming to it.&nbsp; Father, chance then threw into
my way a new acquaintance; a man such as I had had no experience
of; used to the world; light, polished, easy; making no
pretences; avowing the low estimate of everything, that I was
half afraid to form in secret; conveying to me almost
immediately, though I don&rsquo;t know how or by what degrees,
that he understood me, and read my thoughts.&nbsp; I could not
find that he was worse than I.&nbsp; There seemed to be a near
affinity between us.&nbsp; I only wondered it should be worth his
while, who cared for nothing else, to care so much for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For you, Louisa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her father might instinctively have loosened his hold, but
that he felt her strength departing from her, and saw a wild
dilating fire in the eyes steadfastly regarding him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say nothing of his plea for claiming my
confidence.&nbsp; It matters very little how he gained it.&nbsp;
Father, he did gain it.&nbsp; What you know of the story of my
marriage, he soon knew, just as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s face was ashy white, and he held her in
both his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have done no worse, I have not disgraced you.&nbsp;
But if you ask me whether I have loved him, or do love him, I
tell you plainly, father, that it may be so.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took her hands suddenly from his shoulders, and pressed
them both upon her side; while in her face, not like
itself&mdash;and in her figure, drawn up, resolute to finish by a
last effort what she had to say&mdash;the feelings long
suppressed broke loose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This night, my husband being away, he has been with me,
declaring himself my lover.&nbsp; This minute he expects me, for
I could release myself of his presence by no other means.&nbsp; I
do not know that I am sorry, I do not know that I am ashamed, I
do not know that I am degraded in my own esteem.&nbsp; All that I
know is, your philosophy and your teaching will not save
me.&nbsp; Now, father, you have brought me to this.&nbsp; Save me
by some other means!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He tightened his hold in time to prevent her sinking on the
floor, but she cried out in a terrible voice, &lsquo;I shall die
if you hold me!&nbsp; Let me fall upon the ground!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he laid her down there, and saw the pride of his heart and
the triumph of his system, lying, an insensible heap, at his
feet.</p>

THE THIRD<br />
<i>GARNERING</i></h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ANOTHER THING NEEDFUL</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Louisa</span> awoke from a torpor, and her
eyes languidly opened on her old bed at home, and her old
room.&nbsp; It seemed, at first, as if all that had happened
since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the
shadows of a dream, but gradually, as the objects became more
real to her sight, the events became more real to her mind.</p>
<p>She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness, her
eyes were strained and sore, and she was very weak.&nbsp; A
curious passive inattention had such possession of her, that the
presence of her little sister in the room did not attract her
notice for some time.&nbsp; Even when their eyes had met, and her
sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at
her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive
hand, before she asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;When was I brought to this room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Last night, Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who brought me here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sissy, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you believe so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I found her here this morning.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t come to my bedside to wake me, as she always does;
and I went to look for her.&nbsp; She was not in her own room
either; and I went looking for her all over the house, until I
found her here taking care of you and cooling your head.&nbsp;
Will you see father? Sissy said I was to tell him when you
woke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a beaming face you have, Jane!&rsquo; said Louisa,
as her young sister&mdash;timidly still&mdash;bent down to kiss
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have I?&nbsp; I am very glad you think so.&nbsp; I am
sure it must be Sissy&rsquo;s doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent
itself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can tell father if you
will.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, staying her for a moment, she said,
&lsquo;It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this
look of welcome?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came.&nbsp; It
was&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more.&nbsp; When
her sister had withdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay
with her face towards the door, until it opened and her father
entered.</p>
<p>He had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually
steady, trembled in hers.&nbsp; He sat down at the side of the
bed, tenderly asking how she was, and dwelling on the necessity
of her keeping very quiet after her agitation and exposure to the
weather last night.&nbsp; He spoke in a subdued and troubled
voice, very different from his usual dictatorial manner; and was
often at a loss for words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Louisa.&nbsp; My poor daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
was so much at a loss at that place, that he stopped
altogether.&nbsp; He tried again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My unfortunate child.&rsquo;&nbsp; The place was so
difficult to get over, that he tried again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour to
tell you how overwhelmed I have been, and still am, by what broke
upon me last night.&nbsp; The ground on which I stand has ceased
to be solid under my feet.&nbsp; The only support on which I
leaned, and the strength of which it seemed, and still does seem,
impossible to question, has given way in an instant.&nbsp; I am
stunned by these discoveries.&nbsp; I have no selfish meaning in
what I say; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last
night, to be very heavy indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could give him no comfort herein.&nbsp; She had suffered
the wreck of her whole life upon the rock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not say, Louisa, that if you had by any happy
chance undeceived me some time ago, it would have been better for
us both; better for your peace, and better for mine.&nbsp; For I
am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to
invite any confidence of that kind.&nbsp; I had proved
my&mdash;my system to myself, and I have rigidly administered it;
and I must bear the responsibility of its failures.&nbsp; I only
entreat you to believe, my favourite child, that I have meant to
do right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said it earnestly, and to do him justice he had.&nbsp; In
gauging fathomless deeps with his little mean excise-rod, and in
staggering over the universe with his rusty stiff-legged
compasses, he had meant to do great things.&nbsp; Within the
limits of his short tether he had tumbled about, annihilating the
flowers of existence with greater singleness of purpose than many
of the blatant personages whose company he kept.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am well assured of what you say, father.&nbsp; I know
I have been your favourite child.&nbsp; I know you have intended
to make me happy.&nbsp; I have never blamed you, and I never
shall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took her outstretched hand, and retained it in his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, I have remained all night at my table,
pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between
us.&nbsp; When I consider your character; when I consider that
what has been known to me for hours, has been concealed by you
for years; when I consider under what immediate pressure it has
been forced from you at last; I come to the conclusion that I
cannot but mistrust myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He might have added more than all, when he saw the face now
looking at him.&nbsp; He did add it in effect, perhaps, as he
softly moved her scattered hair from her forehead with his
hand.&nbsp; Such little actions, slight in another man, were very
noticeable in him; and his daughter received them as if they had
been words of contrition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, slowly, and with
hesitation, as well as with a wretched sense of happiness,
&lsquo;if I see reason to mistrust myself for the past, Louisa, I
should also mistrust myself for the present and the future.&nbsp;
To speak unreservedly to you, I do.&nbsp; I am far from feeling
convinced now, however differently I might have felt only this
time yesterday, that I am fit for the trust you repose in me;
that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to
make to me; that I have the right instinct&mdash;supposing it for
the moment to be some quality of that nature&mdash;how to help
you, and to set you right, my child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face upon her
arm, so that he could not see it.&nbsp; All her wildness and
passion had subsided; but, though softened, she was not in
tears.&nbsp; Her father was changed in nothing so much as in the
respect that he would have been glad to see her in tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some persons hold,&rsquo; he pursued, still hesitating,
&lsquo;that there is a wisdom of the Head, and that there is a
wisdom of the Heart.&nbsp; I have not supposed so; but, as I have
said, I mistrust myself now.&nbsp; I have supposed the head to be
all-sufficient.&nbsp; It may not be all-sufficient; how can I
venture this morning to say it is!&nbsp; If that other kind of
wisdom should be what I have neglected, and should be the
instinct that is wanted, Louisa&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling
to admit it even now.&nbsp; She made him no answer, lying before
him on her bed, still half-dressed, much as he had seen her lying
on the floor of his room last night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa,&rsquo; and his hand rested on her hair again,
&lsquo;I have been absent from here, my dear, a good deal of
late; and though your sister&rsquo;s training has been pursued
according to&mdash;the system,&rsquo; he appeared to come to that
word with great reluctance always, &lsquo;it has necessarily been
modified by daily associations begun, in her case, at an early
age.&nbsp; I ask you&mdash;ignorantly and humbly, my
daughter&mdash;for the better, do you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she replied, without stirring, &lsquo;if
any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute
in mine until it turned to discord, let her thank Heaven for it,
and go upon her happier way, taking it as her greatest blessing
that she has avoided my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O my child, my child!&rsquo; he said, in a forlorn
manner, &lsquo;I am an unhappy man to see you thus!&nbsp; What
avails it to me that you do not reproach me, if I so bitterly
reproach myself!&rsquo;&nbsp; He bent his head, and spoke low to
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Louisa, I have a misgiving that some change may
have been slowly working about me in this house, by mere love and
gratitude: that what the Head had left undone and could not do,
the Heart may have been doing silently.&nbsp; Can it be
so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made him no reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not too proud to believe it, Louisa.&nbsp; How
could I be arrogant, and you before me!&nbsp; Can it be so?&nbsp;
Is it so, my dear?&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked upon her once more,
lying cast away there; and without another word went out of the
room.&nbsp; He had not been long gone, when she heard a light
tread near the door, and knew that some one stood beside her.</p>
<p>She did not raise her head.&nbsp; A dull anger that she should
be seen in her distress, and that the involuntary look she had so
resented should come to this fulfilment, smouldered within her
like an unwholesome fire.&nbsp; All closely imprisoned forces
rend and destroy.&nbsp; The air that would be healthful to the
earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that would ripen
it, tear it when caged up.&nbsp; So in her bosom even now; the
strongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon themselves,
became a heap of obduracy, that rose against a friend.</p>
<p>It was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and that she
understood herself to be supposed to have fallen asleep.&nbsp;
The sympathetic hand did not claim her resentment.&nbsp; Let it
lie there, let it lie.</p>
<p>It lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts;
and she rested.&nbsp; As she softened with the quiet, and the
consciousness of being so watched, some tears made their way into
her eyes.&nbsp; The face touched hers, and she knew that there
were tears upon it too, and she the cause of them.</p>
<p>As Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired,
so that she stood placidly near the bedside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I have not disturbed you.&nbsp; I have come to
ask if you would let me stay with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you stay with me?&nbsp; My sister will miss
you.&nbsp; You are everything to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; returned Sissy, shaking her head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I would be something to you, if I might.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Louisa, almost sternly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever you want most, if I could be that.&nbsp; At
all events, I would like to try to be as near it as I can.&nbsp;
And however far off that may be, I will never tire of
trying.&nbsp; Will you let me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father sent you to ask me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No indeed,&rsquo; replied Sissy.&nbsp; &lsquo;He told
me that I might come in now, but he sent me away from the room
this morning&mdash;or at least&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated and stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At least, what?&rsquo; said Louisa, with her searching
eyes upon her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it best myself that I should be sent away,
for I felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have I always hated you so much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have
always wished that you should know it.&nbsp; But you changed to
me a little, shortly before you left home.&nbsp; Not that I
wondered at it.&nbsp; You knew so much, and I knew so little, and
it was so natural in many ways, going as you were among other
friends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all
hurt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly.&nbsp;
Louisa understood the loving pretence, and her heart smote
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I try?&rsquo; said Sissy, emboldened to raise her
hand to the neck that was insensibly drooping towards her.</p>
<p>Louisa, taking down the hand that would have embraced her in
another moment, held it in one of hers, and answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;First, Sissy, do you know what I am?&nbsp; I am so
proud and so hardened, so confused and troubled, so resentful and
unjust to every one and to myself, that everything is stormy,
dark, and wicked to me.&nbsp; Does not that repel you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so unhappy, and all that should have made me
otherwise is so laid waste, that if I had been bereft of sense to
this hour, and instead of being as learned as you think me, had
to begin to acquire the simplest truths, I could not want a guide
to peace, contentment, honour, all the good of which I am quite
devoid, more abjectly than I do.&nbsp; Does not that repel
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the innocence of her brave affection, and the brimming up
of her old devoted spirit, the once deserted girl shone like a
beautiful light upon the darkness of the other.</p>
<p>Louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join
its fellow there.&nbsp; She fell upon her knees, and clinging to
this stroller&rsquo;s child looked up at her almost with
veneration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive me, pity me, help me!&nbsp; Have compassion on
my great need, and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving
heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O lay it here!&rsquo; cried Sissy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lay it
here, my dear.&rsquo;</p>

172</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">VERY RIDICULOUS</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. James Harthouse</span> passed a whole
night and a day in a state of so much hurry, that the World, with
its best glass in his eye, would scarcely have recognized him
during that insane interval, as the brother Jem of the honourable
and jocular member.&nbsp; He was positively agitated.&nbsp; He
several times spoke with an emphasis, similar to the vulgar
manner.&nbsp; He went in and went out in an unaccountable way,
like a man without an object.&nbsp; He rode like a
highwayman.&nbsp; In a word, he was so horribly bored by existing
circumstances, that he forgot to go in for boredom in the manner
prescribed by the authorities.</p>
<p>After putting his horse at Coketown through the storm, as if
it were a leap, he waited up all night: from time to time ringing
his bell with the greatest fury, charging the porter who kept
watch with delinquency in withholding letters or messages that
could not fail to have been entrusted to him, and demanding
restitution on the spot.&nbsp; The dawn coming, the morning
coming, and the day coming, and neither message nor letter coming
with either, he went down to the country house.&nbsp; There, the
report was, Mr. Bounderby away, and Mrs. Bounderby in town.&nbsp;
Left for town suddenly last evening.&nbsp; Not even known to be
gone until receipt of message, importing that her return was not
to be expected for the present.</p>
<p>In these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her
to town.&nbsp; He went to the house in town.&nbsp; Mrs. Bounderby
not there.&nbsp; He looked in at the Bank.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby
away and Mrs. Sparsit away.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit away?&nbsp; Who
could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of
that griffin!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Tom, who
had his own reasons for being uneasy about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
was off somewhere at daybreak this morning.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
always full of mystery; I hate her.&nbsp; So I do that white
chap; he&rsquo;s always got his blinking eyes upon a
fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where were you last night, Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where was I last night!&rsquo; said Tom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come!&nbsp; I like that.&nbsp; I was waiting for you, Mr.
Harthouse, till it came down as <i>I</i> never saw it come down
before.&nbsp; Where was I too!&nbsp; Where were you, you
mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was prevented from coming&mdash;detained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Detained!&rsquo; murmured Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two of us
were detained.&nbsp; I was detained looking for you, till I lost
every train but the mail.&nbsp; It would have been a pleasant job
to go down by that on such a night, and have to walk home through
a pond.&nbsp; I was obliged to sleep in town after
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where?&nbsp; Why, in my own bed at
Bounderby&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you see your sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How the deuce,&rsquo; returned Tom, staring,
&lsquo;could I see my sister when she was fifteen miles
off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he
was so true a friend, Mr. Harthouse disembarrassed himself of
that interview with the smallest conceivable amount of ceremony,
and debated for the hundredth time what all this could
mean?&nbsp; He made only one thing clear.&nbsp; It was, that
whether she was in town or out of town, whether he had been
premature with her who was so hard to comprehend, or she had lost
courage, or they were discovered, or some mischance or mistake,
at present incomprehensible, had occurred, he must remain to
confront his fortune, whatever it was.&nbsp; The hotel where he
was known to live when condemned to that region of blackness, was
the stake to which he was tied.&nbsp; As to all the
rest&mdash;What will be, will be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, whether I am waiting for a hostile message, or an
assignation, or a penitent remonstrance, or an impromptu wrestle
with my friend Bounderby in the Lancashire manner&mdash;which
would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of
affairs&mdash;I&rsquo;ll dine,&rsquo; said Mr. James
Harthouse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bounderby has the advantage in point of
weight; and if anything of a British nature is to come off
between us, it may be as well to be in training.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therefore he rang the bell, and tossing himself negligently on
a sofa, ordered &lsquo;Some dinner at six&mdash;with a beefsteak
in it,&rsquo; and got through the intervening time as well as he
could.&nbsp; That was not particularly well; for he remained in
the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on, and no kind
of explanation offered itself, his perplexity augmented at
compound interest.</p>
<p>However, he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature
to do, and entertained himself with the facetious idea of the
training more than once.&nbsp; &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be
bad,&rsquo; he yawned at one time, &lsquo;to give the waiter five
shillings, and throw him.&rsquo;&nbsp; At another time it
occurred to him, &lsquo;Or a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen
stone might be hired by the hour.&rsquo;&nbsp; But these jests
did not tell materially on the afternoon, or his suspense; and,
sooth to say, they both lagged fearfully.</p>
<p>It was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often walking
about in the pattern of the carpet, looking out of the window,
listening at the door for footsteps, and occasionally becoming
rather hot when any steps approached that room.&nbsp; But, after
dinner, when the day turned to twilight, and the twilight turned
to night, and still no communication was made to him, it began to
be as he expressed it, &lsquo;like the Holy Office and slow
torture.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, still true to his conviction that
indifference was the genuine high-breeding (the only conviction
he had), he seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering
candles and a newspaper.</p>
<p>He had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read this
newspaper, when the waiter appeared and said, at once
mysteriously and apologetically:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re wanted, sir,
if you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the
Police said to the swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the
waiter in return, with bristling indignation, what the Devil he
meant by &lsquo;wanted&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir.&nbsp; Young lady outside, sir,
wishes to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Outside?&nbsp; Where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Outside this door, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a
block-head duly qualified for that consignment, Mr. Harthouse
hurried into the gallery.&nbsp; A young woman whom he had never
seen stood there.&nbsp; Plainly dressed, very quiet, very
pretty.&nbsp; As he conducted her into the room and placed a
chair for her, he observed, by the light of the candles, that she
was even prettier than he had at first believed.&nbsp; Her face
was innocent and youthful, and its expression remarkably
pleasant.&nbsp; She was not afraid of him, or in any way
disconcerted; she seemed to have her mind entirely preoccupied
with the occasion of her visit, and to have substituted that
consideration for herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I speak to Mr. Harthouse?&rsquo; she said, when they
were alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Mr. Harthouse.&rsquo;&nbsp; He added in his mind,
&lsquo;And you speak to him with the most confiding eyes I ever
saw, and the most earnest voice (though so quiet) I ever
heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I do not understand&mdash;and I do not,
sir&rsquo;&mdash;said Sissy, &lsquo;what your honour as a
gentleman binds you to, in other matters:&rsquo; the blood really
rose in his face as she began in these words: &lsquo;I am sure I
may rely upon it to keep my visit secret, and to keep secret what
I am going to say.&nbsp; I will rely upon it, if you will tell me
I may so far trust&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may, I assure you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am young, as you see; I am alone, as you see.&nbsp;
In coming to you, sir, I have no advice or encouragement beyond
my own hope.&rsquo;&nbsp; He thought, &lsquo;But that is very
strong,&rsquo; as he followed the momentary upward glance of her
eyes.&nbsp; He thought besides, &lsquo;This is a very odd
beginning.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see where we are going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Sissy, &lsquo;you have already
guessed whom I left just now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness
during the last four-and-twenty hours (which have appeared as
many years),&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;on a lady&rsquo;s
account.&nbsp; The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you
come from that lady, do not deceive me, I trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I left her within an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At her father&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harthouse&rsquo;s face lengthened in spite of his
coolness, and his perplexity increased.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I
certainly,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;do <i>not</i> see where we
are going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She hurried there last night.&nbsp; She arrived there
in great agitation, and was insensible all through the
night.&nbsp; I live at her father&rsquo;s, and was with
her.&nbsp; You may be sure, sir, you will never see her again as
long as you live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harthouse drew a long breath; and, if ever man found
himself in the position of not knowing what to say, made the
discovery beyond all question that he was so circumstanced.&nbsp;
The child-like ingenuousness with which his visitor spoke, her
modest fearlessness, her truthfulness which put all artifice
aside, her entire forgetfulness of herself in her earnest quiet
holding to the object with which she had come; all this, together
with her reliance on his easily given promise&mdash;which in
itself shamed him&mdash;presented something in which he was so
inexperienced, and against which he knew any of his usual weapons
would fall so powerless; that not a word could he rally to his
relief.</p>
<p>At last he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;So startling an announcement, so confidently made, and
by such lips, is really disconcerting in the last degree.&nbsp;
May I be permitted to inquire, if you are charged to convey that
information to me in those hopeless words, by the lady of whom we
speak?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no charge from her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The drowning man catches at the straw.&nbsp; With no
disrespect for your judgment, and with no doubt of your
sincerity, excuse my saying that I cling to the belief that there
is yet hope that I am not condemned to perpetual exile from that
lady&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is not the least hope.&nbsp; The first object of
my coming here, sir, is to assure you that you must believe that
there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again, than
there would be if she had died when she came home last
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must believe?&nbsp; But if I can&rsquo;t&mdash;or if I
should, by infirmity of nature, be obstinate&mdash;and
won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is still true.&nbsp; There is no hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James Harthouse looked at her with an incredulous smile upon
his lips; but her mind looked over and beyond him, and the smile
was quite thrown away.</p>
<p>He bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; If it should unhappily appear,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;after due pains and duty on my part, that I am
brought to a position so desolate as this banishment, I shall not
become the lady&rsquo;s persecutor.&nbsp; But you said you had no
commission from her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only the commission of my love for her, and her
love for me.&nbsp; I have no other trust, than that I have been
with her since she came home, and that she has given me her
confidence.&nbsp; I have no further trust, than that I know
something of her character and her marriage.&nbsp; O Mr.
Harthouse, I think you had that trust too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was touched in the cavity where his heart should have
been&mdash;in that nest of addled eggs, where the birds of heaven
would have lived if they had not been whistled away&mdash;by the
fervour of this reproach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not a moral sort of fellow,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and I never make any pretensions to the character of a
moral sort of fellow.&nbsp; I am as immoral as need be.&nbsp; At
the same time, in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the
subject of the present conversation, or in unfortunately
compromising her in any way, or in committing myself by any
expression of sentiments towards her, not perfectly reconcilable
with&mdash;in fact with&mdash;the domestic hearth; or in taking
any advantage of her father&rsquo;s being a machine, or of her
brother&rsquo;s being a whelp, or of her husband&rsquo;s being a
bear; I beg to be allowed to assure you that I have had no
particularly evil intentions, but have glided on from one step to
another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical, that I had not
the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until I began
to turn it over.&nbsp; Whereas I find,&rsquo; said Mr. James
Harthouse, in conclusion, &lsquo;that it is really in several
volumes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though he said all this in his frivolous way, the way seemed,
for that once, a conscious polishing of but an ugly
surface.&nbsp; He was silent for a moment; and then proceeded
with a more self-possessed air, though with traces of vexation
and disappointment that would not be polished out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After what has been just now represented to me, in a
manner I find it impossible to doubt&mdash;I know of hardly any
other source from which I could have accepted it so
readily&mdash;I feel bound to say to you, in whom the confidence
you have mentioned has been reposed, that I cannot refuse to
contemplate the possibility (however unexpected) of my seeing the
lady no more.&nbsp; I am solely to blame for the thing having
come to this&mdash;and&mdash;and, I cannot say,&rsquo; he added,
rather hard up for a general peroration, &lsquo;that I have any
sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow, or
that I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow
whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy&rsquo;s face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him
was not finished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You spoke,&rsquo; he resumed, as she raised her eyes to
him again, &lsquo;of your first object.&nbsp; I may assume that
there is a second to be mentioned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you oblige me by confiding it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Harthouse,&rsquo; returned Sissy, with a blending
of gentleness and steadiness that quite defeated him, and with a
simple confidence in his being bound to do what she required,
that held him at a singular disadvantage, &lsquo;the only
reparation that remains with you, is to leave here immediately
and finally.&nbsp; I am quite sure that you can mitigate in no
other way the wrong and harm you have done.&nbsp; I am quite sure
that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power
to make.&nbsp; I do not say that it is much, or that it is
enough; but it is something, and it is necessary.&nbsp;
Therefore, though without any other authority than I have given
you, and even without the knowledge of any other person than
yourself and myself, I ask you to depart from this place
to-night, under an obligation never to return to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If she had asserted any influence over him beyond her plain
faith in the truth and right of what she said; if she had
concealed the least doubt or irresolution, or had harboured for
the best purpose any reserve or pretence; if she had shown, or
felt, the lightest trace of any sensitiveness to his ridicule or
his astonishment, or any remonstrance he might offer; he would
have carried it against her at this point.&nbsp; But he could as
easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise, as
affect her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But do you know,&rsquo; he asked, quite at a loss,
&lsquo;the extent of what you ask?&nbsp; You probably are not
aware that I am here on a public kind of business, preposterous
enough in itself, but which I have gone in for, and sworn by, and
am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner?&nbsp;
You probably are not aware of that, but I assure you it&rsquo;s
the fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It had no effect on Sissy, fact or no fact.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides which,&rsquo; said Mr. Harthouse, taking a turn
or two across the room, dubiously, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s so
alarmingly absurd.&nbsp; It would make a man so ridiculous, after
going in for these fellows, to back out in such an
incomprehensible way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite sure,&rsquo; repeated Sissy, &lsquo;that it
is the only reparation in your power, sir.&nbsp; I am quite sure,
or I would not have come here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at her face, and walked about again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Upon my soul, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&nbsp; So
immensely absurd!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It fell to his lot, now, to stipulate for secrecy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing,&rsquo; he
said, stopping again presently, and leaning against the
chimney-piece, &lsquo;it could only be in the most inviolable
confidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will trust to you, sir,&rsquo; returned Sissy,
&lsquo;and you will trust to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His leaning against the chimney-piece reminded him of the
night with the whelp.&nbsp; It was the self-same chimney-piece,
and somehow he felt as if <i>he</i> were the whelp
to-night.&nbsp; He could make no way at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous
position,&rsquo; he said, after looking down, and looking up, and
laughing, and frowning, and walking off, and walking back
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I see no way out of it.&nbsp; What will
be, will be.&nbsp; <i>This</i> will be, I suppose.&nbsp; I must
take off myself, I imagine&mdash;in short, I engage to do
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy rose.&nbsp; She was not surprised by the result, but she
was happy in it, and her face beamed brightly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will permit me to say,&rsquo; continued Mr. James
Harthouse, &lsquo;that I doubt if any other ambassador, or
ambassadress, could have addressed me with the same
success.&nbsp; I must not only regard myself as being in a very
ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points.&nbsp;
Will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy&rsquo;s
name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>My</i> name?&rsquo; said the ambassadress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only name I could possibly care to know,
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sissy Jupe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon my curiosity at parting.&nbsp; Related to the
family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am only a poor girl,&rsquo; returned Sissy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was separated from my father&mdash;he was only a
stroller&mdash;and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; I have
lived in the house ever since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wanted this to complete the defeat,&rsquo; said Mr.
James Harthouse, sinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after
standing transfixed a little while.&nbsp; &lsquo;The defeat may
now be considered perfectly accomplished.&nbsp; Only a poor
girl&mdash;only a stroller&mdash;only James Harthouse made
nothing of&mdash;only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of
failure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the
Nile.&nbsp; He took a pen upon the instant, and wrote the
following note (in appropriate hieroglyphics) to his brother:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Jack,&mdash;All up at Coketown.&nbsp; Bored
out of the place, and going in for camels.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Affectionately,<br />
<span class="smcap">Jem</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He rang the bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send my fellow here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone to bed, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell him to get up, and pack up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wrote two more notes.&nbsp; One, to Mr. Bounderby,
announcing his retirement from that part of the country, and
showing where he would be found for the next fortnight.&nbsp; The
other, similar in effect, to Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; Almost as soon
as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions, he had left the
tall chimneys of Coketown behind, <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>and was in a railway carriage,
tearing and glaring over the dark landscape.</p>
<p>The moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr. James
Harthouse derived some comfortable reflections afterwards, from
this prompt retreat, as one of his few actions that made any
amends for anything, and as a token to himself that he had
escaped the climax of a very bad business.&nbsp; But it was not
so, at all.&nbsp; A secret sense of having failed and been
ridiculous&mdash;a dread of what other fellows who went in for
similar sorts of things, would say at his expense if they knew
it&mdash;so oppressed him, that what was about the very best
passage in his life was the one of all others he would not have
owned to on any account, and the only one that made him ashamed
of himself.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">VERY DECIDED</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> indefatigable Mrs. Sparsit,
with a violent cold upon her, her voice reduced to a whisper, and
her stately frame so racked by continual sneezes that it seemed
in danger of dismemberment, gave chase to her patron until she
found him in the metropolis; and there, majestically sweeping in
upon him at his hotel in St. James&rsquo;s Street, exploded the
combustibles with which she was charged, and blew up.&nbsp;
Having executed her mission with infinite relish, this
high-minded woman then fainted away on Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s
coat-collar.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s first procedure was to shake Mrs.
Sparsit off, and leave her to progress as she might through
various stages of suffering on the floor.&nbsp; He next had
recourse to the administration of potent restoratives, such as
screwing the patient&rsquo;s thumbs, smiting her hands,
abundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her
mouth.&nbsp; When these attentions had recovered her (which they
speedily did), he hustled her into a fast train without offering
any other refreshment, and carried her back to Coketown more dead
than alive.</p>
<p>Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting
spectacle on her arrival at her journey&rsquo;s end; but
considered in any other light, the amount of damage she had by
that time sustained was excessive, and impaired her claims to
admiration.&nbsp; Utterly heedless of the wear and tear of her
clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes,
Mr. Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her
off to Stone Lodge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Tom Gradgrind,&rsquo; said Bounderby, bursting
into his father-in-law&rsquo;s room late at night;
&lsquo;here&rsquo;s a lady here&mdash;Mrs. Sparsit&mdash;you know
Mrs. Sparsit&mdash;who has something to say to you that will
strike you dumb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have missed my letter!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr.
Gradgrind, surprised by the apparition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Missed your letter, sir!&rsquo; bawled Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The present time is no time for letters.&nbsp; No man
shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with
his mind in the state it&rsquo;s in now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bounderby,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of
temperate remonstrance, &lsquo;I speak of a very special letter I
have written to you, in reference to Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tom Gradgrind,&rsquo; replied Bounderby, knocking the
flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table,
&lsquo;I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me,
in reference to Louisa.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am, stand
forward!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony,
without any voice and with painful gestures expressive of an
inflamed throat, became so aggravating and underwent so many
facial contortions, that Mr. Bounderby, unable to bear it, seized
her by the arm and shook her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t get it out, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, &lsquo;leave <i>me</i> to get it out.&nbsp; This is
not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be totally
inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.&nbsp; Tom Gradgrind,
Mrs. Sparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation
to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and
your precious gentleman-friend, Mr. James Harthouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Indeed!&rsquo; cried Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And in that conversation&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not necessary to repeat its tenor,
Bounderby.&nbsp; I know what passed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do?&nbsp; Perhaps,&rsquo; said Bounderby, staring
with all his might at his so quiet and assuasive father-in-law,
&lsquo;you know where your daughter is at the present
time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Undoubtedly.&nbsp; She is here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these
loud out-breaks, on all accounts.&nbsp; Louisa is here.&nbsp; The
moment she could detach herself from that interview with the
person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply regret to have been
the means of introducing to you, Louisa hurried here, for
protection.&nbsp; I myself had not been at home many hours, when
I received her&mdash;here, in this room.&nbsp; She hurried by the
train to town, she ran from town to this house, through a raging
storm, and presented herself before me in a state of
distraction.&nbsp; Of course, she has remained here ever
since.&nbsp; Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers,
to be more quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in
every direction except Mrs. Sparsit&rsquo;s direction; and then,
abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that
wretched woman:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; We shall be happy to hear any
little apology you may think proper to offer, for going about the
country at express pace, with no other luggage than a
Cock-and-a-Bull, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; whispered Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;my nerves
are at present too much shaken, and my health is at present too
much impaired, in your service, to admit of my doing more than
taking refuge in tears.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Which she did.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;without making any observation to you that may not be made
with propriety to a woman of good family, what I have got to add
to that, is that there is something else in which it appears to
me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.&nbsp; And the coach in
which we came here being at the door, you&rsquo;ll allow me to
hand you down to it, and pack you home to the Bank: where the
best course for you to pursue, will be to put your feet into the
hottest water you can bear, and take a glass of scalding rum and
butter after you get into bed.&rsquo;&nbsp; With these words, Mr.
Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady, and
escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many
plaintive sneezes by the way.&nbsp; He soon returned alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that
you wanted to speak to me,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;here I
am.&nbsp; But, I am not in a very agreeable state, I tell you
plainly: not relishing this business, even as it is, and not
considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively
treated by your daughter, as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought
to be treated by his wife.&nbsp; You have your opinion, I dare
say; and I have mine, I know.&nbsp; If you mean to say anything
to me to-night, that goes against this candid remark, you had
better let it alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, Mr.
Bounderby took particular pains to harden himself at all
points.&nbsp; It was his amiable nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Bounderby,&rsquo; Mr. Gradgrind began in
reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
&lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t want to be too dear.&nbsp; That, to
start with.&nbsp; When I begin to be dear to a man, I generally
find that his intention is to come over me.&nbsp; I am not
speaking to you politely; but, as you are aware, I am <i>not</i>
polite.&nbsp; If you like politeness, you know where to get
it.&nbsp; You have your gentleman-friends, you know, and
they&rsquo;ll serve you with as much of the article as you
want.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t keep it myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bounderby,&rsquo; urged Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;we are
all liable to mistakes&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em,&rsquo;
interrupted Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I thought so.&nbsp; But, I say we are all
liable to mistakes and I should feel sensible of your delicacy,
and grateful for it, if you would spare me these references to
Harthouse.&nbsp; I shall not associate him in our conversation
with your intimacy and encouragement; pray do not persist in
connecting him with mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never mentioned his name!&rsquo; said Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; returned Mr. Gradgrind, with a
patient, even a submissive, air.&nbsp; And he sat for a little
while pondering.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bounderby, I see reason to doubt
whether we have ever quite understood Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who do you mean by We?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me say I, then,&rsquo; he returned, in answer to
the coarsely blurted question; &lsquo;I doubt whether I have
understood Louisa.&nbsp; I doubt whether I have been quite right
in the manner of her education.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There you hit it,&rsquo; returned Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There I agree with you.&nbsp; You have found it out at
last, have you?&nbsp; Education!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what
education is&mdash;To be tumbled out of doors, neck and crop, and
put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> call education.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think your good sense will perceive,&rsquo; Mr.
Gradgrind remonstrated in all humility, &lsquo;that whatever the
merits of such a system may be, it would be difficult of general
application to girls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see it at all, sir,&rsquo; returned the
obstinate Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; sighed Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;we will not
enter into the question.&nbsp; I assure you I have no desire to
be controversial.&nbsp; I seek to repair what is amiss, if I
possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit,
Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, yet,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, with determined obstinacy, &lsquo;and therefore I
won&rsquo;t make any promises.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,&rsquo;
Mr. Gradgrind proceeded, in the same depressed and propitiatory
manner, &lsquo;I appear to myself to have become better informed
as to Louisa&rsquo;s character, than in previous years.&nbsp; The
enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and the
discovery is not mine.&nbsp; I think there are&mdash;Bounderby,
you will be surprised to hear me say this&mdash;I think there are
qualities in Louisa, which&mdash;which have been harshly
neglected, and&mdash;and a little perverted.&nbsp; And&mdash;and
I would suggest to you, that&mdash;that if you would kindly meet
me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a
while&mdash;and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness
and consideration&mdash;it&mdash;it would be the better for the
happiness of all of us.&nbsp; Louisa,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
shading his face with his hand, &lsquo;has always been my
favourite child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an
extent on hearing these words, that he seemed to be, and probably
was, on the brink of a fit.&nbsp; With his very ears a bright
purple shot with crimson, he pent up his indignation, however,
and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d like to keep her here for a
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby,
that you should allow Louisa to remain here on a visit, and be
attended by Sissy (I mean of course Cecilia Jupe), who
understands her, and in whom she trusts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, standing up with his hands in his pockets, &lsquo;that
you are of opinion that there&rsquo;s what people call some
incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear there is at present a general incompatibility
between Louisa, and&mdash;and&mdash;and almost all the relations
in which I have placed her,&rsquo; was her father&rsquo;s
sorrowful reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,&rsquo; said
Bounderby the flushed, confronting him with his legs wide apart,
his hands deeper in his pockets, and his hair like a hayfield
wherein his windy anger was boisterous.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
said your say; I am going to say mine.&nbsp; I am a Coketown
man.&nbsp; I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.&nbsp; I know the
bricks of this town, and I know the works of this town, and I
know the chimneys of this town, and I know the smoke of this
town, and I know the Hands of this town.&nbsp; I know &rsquo;em
all pretty well.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re real.&nbsp; When a man tells
me anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man,
whoever he is, that I know what he means.&nbsp; He means turtle
soup and venison, with a gold spoon, and that he wants to be set
up with a coach and six.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what your daughter
wants.&nbsp; Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what
she wants, I recommend you to provide it for her.&nbsp; Because,
Tom Gradgrind, she will never have it from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bounderby,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;I hoped,
after my entreaty, you would have taken a different
tone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just wait a bit,&rsquo; retorted Bounderby; &lsquo;you
have said your say, I believe.&nbsp; I heard you out; hear me
out, if you please.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make yourself a spectacle
of unfairness as well as inconsistency, because, although I am
sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position, I
should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that.&nbsp;
Now, there&rsquo;s an incompatibility of some sort or another, I
am given to understand by you, between your daughter and
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give <i>you</i> to understand, in reply to
that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the
first magnitude&mdash;to be summed up in this&mdash;that your
daughter don&rsquo;t properly know her husband&rsquo;s merits,
and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her, by
George! of the honour of his alliance.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s plain
speaking, I hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bounderby,&rsquo; urged Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;this is
unreasonable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad to
hear you say so.&nbsp; Because when Tom Gradgrind, with his new
lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am convinced
at once it must be devilish sensible.&nbsp; With your permission
I am going on.&nbsp; You know my origin; and you know that for a
good many years of my life I didn&rsquo;t want a shoeing-horn, in
consequence of not having a shoe.&nbsp; Yet you may believe or
not, as you think proper, that there are ladies&mdash;born
ladies&mdash;belonging to families&mdash;Families!&mdash;who next
to worship the ground I walk on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whereas your daughter,&rsquo; proceeded Bounderby,
&lsquo;is far from being a born lady.&nbsp; That you know,
yourself.&nbsp; Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about
such things, for you are very well aware I don&rsquo;t; but that
such is the fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can&rsquo;t change
it.&nbsp; Why do I say this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not, I fear,&rsquo; observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low
voice, &lsquo;to spare me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear me out,&rsquo; said Bounderby, &lsquo;and refrain
from cutting in till your turn comes round.&nbsp; I say this,
because highly connected females have been astonished to see the
way in which your daughter has conducted herself, and to witness
her insensibility.&nbsp; They have wondered how I have suffered
it.&nbsp; And I wonder myself now, and I won&rsquo;t suffer
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bounderby,&rsquo; returned Mr. Gradgrind, rising,
&lsquo;the less we say to-night the better, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, the more we say
to-night, the better, I think.&nbsp; That is,&rsquo; the
consideration checked him, &lsquo;till I have said all I mean to
say, and then I don&rsquo;t care how soon we stop.&nbsp; I come
to a question that may shorten the business.&nbsp; What do you
mean by the proposal you made just now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I mean, Bounderby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By your visiting proposition,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
with an inflexible jerk of the hayfield.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange in a
friendly manner, for allowing Louisa a period of repose and
reflection here, which may tend to a gradual alteration for the
better in many respects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To a softening down of your ideas of the
incompatibility?&rsquo; said Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you put it in those terms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What made you think of this?&rsquo; said Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have already said, I fear Louisa has not been
understood.&nbsp; Is it asking too much, Bounderby, that you, so
far her elder, should aid in trying to set her right?&nbsp; You
have accepted a great charge of her; for better for worse,
for&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his
own words to Stephen Blackpool, but he cut the quotation short
with an angry start.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be
told about that.&nbsp; I know what I took her for, as well as you
do.&nbsp; Never you mind what I took her for; that&rsquo;s my
look out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may
all be more or less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and
that some yielding on your part, remembering the trust you have
accepted, may not only be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a
debt incurred towards Louisa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think differently,&rsquo; blustered Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am going to finish this business according to my own
opinions.&nbsp; Now, I don&rsquo;t want to make a quarrel of it
with you, Tom Gradgrind.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I
don&rsquo;t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel
on such a subject.&nbsp; As to your gentleman-friend, he may take
himself off, wherever he likes best.&nbsp; If he falls in my way,
I shall tell him my mind; if he don&rsquo;t fall in my way, I
shan&rsquo;t, for it won&rsquo;t be worth my while to do
it.&nbsp; As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and
might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she
don&rsquo;t come home to-morrow, by twelve o&rsquo;clock at noon,
I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall
send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you&rsquo;ll
take charge of her for the future.&nbsp; What I shall say to
people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so
laying down the law, will be this.&nbsp; I am Josiah Bounderby,
and I had my bringing-up; she&rsquo;s the daughter of Tom
Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses
wouldn&rsquo;t pull together.&nbsp; I am pretty well known to be
rather an uncommon man, I believe; and most people will
understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the
common, also, who, in the long run, would come up to my
mark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this,
Bounderby,&rsquo; urged Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;before you commit
yourself to such a decision.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always come to a decision,&rsquo; said Bounderby,
tossing his hat on: &lsquo;and whatever I do, I do at once.&nbsp;
I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s addressing such a
remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, knowing what he knows of
him, if I could be surprised by anything Tom Gradgrind did, after
his making himself a party to sentimental humbug.&nbsp; I have
given you my decision, and I have got no more to say.&nbsp; Good
night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed.&nbsp; At
five minutes past twelve o&rsquo;clock next day, he directed Mrs.
Bounderby&rsquo;s property to be carefully packed up and sent to
Tom Gradgrind&rsquo;s; advertised his country retreat for sale by
private contract; and resumed a bachelor life.</p>
<h3><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LOST</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> robbery at the Bank had not
languished before, and did not cease to occupy a front place in
the attention of the principal of that establishment now.&nbsp;
In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity, as a
remarkable man, and a self-made man, and a commercial wonder more
admirable than Venus, who had risen out of the mud instead of the
sea, he liked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his
business ardour.&nbsp; Consequently, in the first few weeks of
his resumed bachelorhood, he even advanced upon his usual display
of bustle, and every day made such a rout in renewing his
investigations into the robbery, that the officers who had it in
hand almost wished it had never been committed.</p>
<p>They were at fault too, and off the scent.&nbsp; Although they
had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the matter, that
most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as
hopeless, nothing new occurred.&nbsp; No implicated man or woman
took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying step.&nbsp; More
remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and the
mysterious old woman remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Things having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs
of stirring beyond it, the upshot of Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s
investigations was, that he resolved to hazard a bold
burst.&nbsp; He drew up a placard, offering Twenty Pounds reward
for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of
complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he
described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion,
estimated height, and manner, as minutely as he could; he recited
how he had left the town, and in what direction he had been last
seen going; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a
staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls to be posted with it
in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon the sight of
the whole population at one blow.</p>
<p>The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning
to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy
daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with eager
eyes.&nbsp; Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the
eyes of those who could not read.&nbsp; These people, as they
listened to the friendly voice that read aloud&mdash;there was
always some such ready to help them&mdash;stared at the
characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that
would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance
could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil.&nbsp;
Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these
placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling
wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out
again into the streets, there were still as many readers as
before.</p>
<p>Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too
that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the
printer, and had brought it in his pocket.&nbsp; Oh, my friends
and fellow-countrymen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown,
oh, my fellow-brothers and fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and
fellow-men, what a to-do was there, when Slackbridge unfolded
what he called &lsquo;that damning document,&rsquo; and held it
up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-man
community!&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a
traitor in the camp of those great spirits who are enrolled upon
the holy scroll of Justice and of Union, is appropriately
capable!&nbsp; Oh, my prostrate friends, with the galling yoke of
tyrants on your necks and the iron foot of despotism treading
down your fallen forms into the dust of the earth, upon which
right glad would your oppressors be to see you creeping on your
bellies all the days of your lives, like the serpent in the
garden&mdash;oh, my brothers, and shall I as a man not add, my
sisters too, what do you say, <i>now</i>, of Stephen Blackpool,
with a slight stoop in his shoulders and about five foot seven in
height, as set forth in this degrading and disgusting document,
this blighting bill, this pernicious placard, this abominable
advertisement; and with what majesty of denouncement will you
crush the viper, who would bring this stain and shame upon the
God-like race that happily has cast him out for ever!&nbsp; Yes,
my compatriots, happily cast him out and sent him forth!&nbsp;
For you remember how he stood here before you on this platform;
you remember how, face to face and foot to foot, I pursued him
through all his intricate windings; you remember how he sneaked
and slunk, and sidled, and splitted of straws, until, with not an
inch of ground to which to cling, I hurled him out from amongst
us: an object for the undying finger of scorn to point at, and
for the avenging fire of every free and thinking mind to scorch
and scar!&nbsp; And now, my friends&mdash;my labouring friends,
for I rejoice and triumph in that stigma&mdash;my friends whose
hard but honest beds are made in toil, and whose scanty but
independent pots are boiled in hardship; and now, I say, my
friends, what appellation has that dastard craven taken to
himself, when, with the mask torn from his features, he stands
before us in all his native deformity, a What?&nbsp; A
thief!&nbsp; A plunderer!&nbsp; A proscribed fugitive, with a
price upon his head; a fester and a wound upon the noble
character of the Coketown operative!&nbsp; Therefore, my band of
brothers in a sacred bond, to which your children and your
children&rsquo;s children yet unborn have set their infant hands
and seals, I propose to you on the part of the United Aggregate
Tribunal, ever watchful for your welfare, ever zealous for your
benefit, that this meeting does Resolve: That Stephen Blackpool,
weaver, referred to in this placard, having been already solemnly
disowned by the community of Coketown Hands, the same are free
from the shame of his misdeeds, and cannot as a class be
reproached with his dishonest actions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus Slackbridge; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious
sort.&nbsp; A few stern voices called out &lsquo;No!&rsquo; and a
score or two hailed, with assenting cries of &lsquo;Hear,
hear!&rsquo; the caution from one man, &lsquo;Slackbridge,
y&rsquo;or over hetter in&rsquo;t; y&rsquo;or a goen too
fast!&rsquo;&nbsp; But these were pigmies against an army; the
general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to
Slackbridge, and gave three cheers for him, as he sat
demonstratively panting at them.</p>
<p>These men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly
to their homes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa
some minutes before, returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; asked Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Mr. Bounderby,&rsquo; said Sissy, timid of the
name, &lsquo;and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young woman who says
her name is Rachael, and that you know her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do they want, Sissy dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They want to see you.&nbsp; Rachael has been crying,
and seems angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said Louisa, for he was present,
&lsquo;I cannot refuse to see them, for a reason that will
explain itself.&nbsp; Shall they come in here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring
them.&nbsp; She reappeared with them directly.&nbsp; Tom was
last; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room,
near the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bounderby,&rsquo; said her husband, entering with
a cool nod, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t disturb you, I hope.&nbsp; This
is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young woman who has been
making statements which render my visit necessary.&nbsp; Tom
Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses for some obstinate
reason or other to say anything at all about those statements,
good or bad, I am obliged to confront her with your
daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have seen me once before, young lady,&rsquo; said
Rachael, standing in front of Louisa.</p>
<p>Tom coughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have seen me, young lady,&rsquo; repeated Rachael,
as she did not answer, &lsquo;once before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tom coughed again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby, and said,
&lsquo;Will you make it known, young lady, where, and who was
there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged, on
the night of his discharge from his work, and I saw you
there.&nbsp; He was there too; and an old woman who did not
speak, and whom I could scarcely see, stood in a dark
corner.&nbsp; My brother was with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you say so, young Tom?&rsquo;
demanded Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promised my sister I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Which Louisa hastily confirmed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And besides,&rsquo;
said the whelp bitterly, &lsquo;she tells her own story so
precious well&mdash;and so full&mdash;that what business had I to
take it out of her mouth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say, young lady, if you please,&rsquo; pursued Rachael,
&lsquo;why, in an evil hour, you ever came to Stephen&rsquo;s
that night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I felt compassion for him,&rsquo; said Louisa, her
colour deepening, &lsquo;and I wished to know what he was going
to do, and wished to offer him assistance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Much flattered and obliged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you offer him,&rsquo; asked Rachael, &lsquo;a
bank-note?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but he refused it, and would only take two pounds
in gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, certainly!&rsquo; said Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable
account was true or not, I am bound to say it&rsquo;s
confirmed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young lady,&rsquo; said Rachael, &lsquo;Stephen
Blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this
town, and where else!&nbsp; There have been a meeting to-night
where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way.&nbsp;
Stephen!&nbsp; The honestest lad, the truest lad, the
best!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her indignation failed her, and she broke off
sobbing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very, very sorry,&rsquo; said Louisa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, young lady, young lady,&rsquo; returned Rachael,
&lsquo;I hope you may be, but I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t say what you may ha&rsquo; done!&nbsp; The like of
you don&rsquo;t know us, don&rsquo;t care for us, don&rsquo;t
belong to us.&nbsp; I am not sure why you may ha&rsquo; come that
night.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell but what you may ha&rsquo; come
wi&rsquo; some aim of your own, not mindin to what trouble you
brought such as the poor lad.&nbsp; I said then, Bless you for
coming; and I said it of my heart, you seemed to take so
pitifully to him; but I don&rsquo;t know now, I don&rsquo;t
know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa could not reproach her for her unjust suspicions; she
was so faithful to her idea of the man, and so afflicted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when I think,&rsquo; said Rachael through her sobs,
&lsquo;that the poor lad was so grateful, thinkin you so good to
him&mdash;when I mind that he put his hand over his hard-worken
face to hide the tears that you brought up there&mdash;Oh, I hope
you may be sorry, and ha&rsquo; no bad cause to be it; but I
don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty article,&rsquo; growled the
whelp, moving uneasily in his dark corner, &lsquo;to come here
with these precious imputations!&nbsp; You ought to be bundled
out for not knowing how to behave yourself, and you would be by
rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing in reply; and her low weeping was the only
sound that was heard, until Mr. Bounderby spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you know what you have
engaged to do.&nbsp; You had better give your mind to that; not
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Deed, I am loath,&rsquo; returned Rachael,
drying her eyes, &lsquo;that any here should see me like this;
but I won&rsquo;t be seen so again.&nbsp; Young lady, when I had
read what&rsquo;s put in print of Stephen&mdash;and what has just
as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you&mdash;I
went straight to the Bank to say I knew where Stephen was, and to
give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two
days.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t meet wi&rsquo; Mr. Bounderby then,
and your brother sent me away, and I tried to find you, but you
was not to be found, and I went back to work.&nbsp; Soon as I
come out of the Mill to-night, I hastened to hear what was said
of Stephen&mdash;for I know wi&rsquo; pride he will come back to
shame it!&mdash;and then I went again to seek Mr. Bounderby, and
I found him, and I told him every word I knew; and he believed no
word I said, and brought me here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So far, that&rsquo;s true enough,&rsquo; assented Mr.
Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets and his hat on.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I have known you people before to-day, you&rsquo;ll
observe, and I know you never die for want of talking.&nbsp; Now,
I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as
doing.&nbsp; You have undertaken to do something; all I remark
upon that at present is, do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have written to Stephen by the post that went out
this afternoon, as I have written to him once before sin&rsquo;
he went away,&rsquo; said Rachael; &lsquo;and he will be here, at
furthest, in two days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll tell you something.&nbsp; You are not
aware perhaps,&rsquo; retorted Mr. Bounderby, &lsquo;that you
yourself have been looked after now and then, not being
considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account
of most people being judged according to the company they
keep.&nbsp; The post-office hasn&rsquo;t been forgotten
either.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;ll tell you is, that no letter to
Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it.&nbsp; Therefore, what has
become of yours, I leave you to guess.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;re
mistaken, and never wrote any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He hadn&rsquo;t been gone from here, young lady,&rsquo;
said Rachael, turning appealingly to Louisa, &lsquo;as much as a
week, when he sent me the only letter I have had from him, saying
that he was forced to seek work in another name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, by George!&rsquo; cried Bounderby, shaking his
head, with a whistle, &lsquo;he changes his name, does he!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s rather unlucky, too, for such an immaculate
chap.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s considered a little suspicious in Courts
of Justice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many
names.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What,&rsquo; said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes
again, &lsquo;what, young lady, in the name of Mercy, was left
the poor lad to do!&nbsp; The masters against him on one hand,
the men against him on the other, he only wantin to work hard in
peace, and do what he felt right.&nbsp; Can a man have no soul of
his own, no mind of his own?&nbsp; Must he go wrong all through
wi&rsquo; this side, or must he go wrong all through wi&rsquo;
that, or else be hunted like a hare?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart,&rsquo;
returned Louisa; &lsquo;and I hope that he will clear
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need have no fear of that, young lady.&nbsp; He is
sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the surer, I suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;for your refusing to tell where he is?&nbsp;
Eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall not, through any act of mine, come back
wi&rsquo; the unmerited reproach of being brought back.&nbsp; He
shall come back of his own accord to clear himself, and put all
those that have injured his good character, and he not here for
its defence, to shame.&nbsp; I have told him what has been done
against him,&rsquo; said Rachael, throwing off all distrust as a
rock throws off the sea, &lsquo;and he will be here, at furthest,
in two days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Notwithstanding which,&rsquo; added Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;if he can be laid hold of any sooner, he shall have an
earlier opportunity of clearing himself.&nbsp; As to you, I have
nothing against you; what you came and told me turns out to be
true, and I have given you the means of proving it to be true,
and there&rsquo;s an end of it.&nbsp; I wish you good night
all!&nbsp; I must be off to look a little further into
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tom came out of his corner when Mr. Bounderby moved, moved
with him, kept close to him, and went away with him.&nbsp; The
only parting salutation of which he delivered himself was a sulky
&lsquo;Good night, father!&rsquo;&nbsp; With a brief speech, and
a scowl at his sister, he left the house.</p>
<p>Since his sheet-anchor had come home, Mr. Gradgrind had been
sparing of speech.&nbsp; He still sat silent, when Louisa mildly
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you
know me better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It goes against me,&rsquo; Rachael answered, in a
gentler manner, &lsquo;to mistrust any one; but when I am so
mistrusted&mdash;when we all are&mdash;I cannot keep such things
quite out of my mind.&nbsp; I ask your pardon for having done you
an injury.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think what I said now.&nbsp; Yet I
might come to think it again, wi&rsquo; the poor lad so
wronged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you tell him in your letter,&rsquo; inquired Sissy,
&lsquo;that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him, because he
had been seen about the Bank at night?&nbsp; He would then know
what he would have to explain on coming back, and would be
ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear,&rsquo; she returned; &lsquo;but I
can&rsquo;t guess what can have ever taken him there.&nbsp; He
never used to go there.&nbsp; It was never in his way.&nbsp; His
way was the same as mine, and not near it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived,
and whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there
were news of him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I doubt,&rsquo; said Rachael, &lsquo;if he can be here
till next day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I will come next night too,&rsquo; said Sissy.</p>
<p>When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind
lifted up his head, and said to his daughter:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen
this man.&nbsp; Do you believe him to be implicated?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I have believed it, father, though with great
difficulty.&nbsp; I do not believe it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe
it, from knowing him to be suspected.&nbsp; His appearance and
manner; are they so honest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very honest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And her confidence not to be shaken!&nbsp; I ask
myself,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, &lsquo;does the real
culprit know of these accusations?&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp; Who
is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His hair had latterly began to change its colour.&nbsp; As he
leaned upon his hand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a
face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him, and sat close
at his side.&nbsp; Her eyes by accident met Sissy&rsquo;s at the
moment.&nbsp; Sissy flushed and started, and Louisa put her
finger on her lip.</p>
<p>Next night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that
Stephen was not come, she told it in a whisper.&nbsp; Next night
again, when she came home with the same account, and added that
he had not been heard of, she spoke in the same low frightened
tone.&nbsp; From the moment of that interchange of looks, they
never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor ever
pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of
it.</p>
<p>The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out,
and Stephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard
of.&nbsp; On the fourth day, Rachael, with unabated confidence,
but considering her despatch to have miscarried, went up to the
Bank, and showed her letter from him with his address, at a
working colony, one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles
away.&nbsp; Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole
town looked for Stephen to be brought in next day.</p>
<p>During this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr.
Bounderby like his shadow, assisting in all the
proceedings.&nbsp; He was greatly excited, horribly fevered, bit
his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard rattling voice, and
with lips that were black and burnt up.&nbsp; At the hour when
the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station;
offering to wager that he had made off before the <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>arrival of
those who were sent in quest of him, and that he would not
appear.</p>
<p>The whelp was right.&nbsp; The messengers returned
alone.&nbsp; Rachael&rsquo;s letter had gone, Rachael&rsquo;s
letter had been delivered.&nbsp; Stephen Blackpool had decamped
in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him.&nbsp; The only
doubt in Coketown was, whether Rachael had written in good faith,
believing that he really would come back, or warning him to
fly.&nbsp; On this point opinion was divided.</p>
<p>Six days, seven days, far on into another week.&nbsp; The
wretched whelp plucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow
defiant.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Was</i> the suspected fellow the
thief?&nbsp; A pretty question!&nbsp; If not, where was the man,
and why did he not come back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Where was the man, and why did he not come back?&nbsp; In the
dead of night the echoes of his own words, which had rolled
Heaven knows how far away in the daytime, came back instead, and
abided by him until morning.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FOUND</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> and night again, day and night
again.&nbsp; No Stephen Blackpool.&nbsp; Where was the man, and
why did he not come back?</p>
<p>Every night, Sissy went to Rachael&rsquo;s lodging, and sat
with her in her small neat room.&nbsp; All day, Rachael toiled as
such people must toil, whatever their anxieties.&nbsp; The
smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or found, who turned
out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants, like the Hard Fact
men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever
happened.&nbsp; Day and night again, day and night again.&nbsp;
The monotony was unbroken.&nbsp; Even Stephen Blackpool&rsquo;s
disappearance was falling into the general way, and becoming as
monotonous a wonder as any piece of machinery in Coketown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I misdoubt,&rsquo; said Rachael, &lsquo;if there is as
many as twenty left in all this place, who have any trust in the
poor dear lad now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only
by the lamp at the street corner.&nbsp; Sissy had come there when
it was already dark, to await her return from work; and they had
since sat at the window where Rachael had found her, wanting no
brighter light to shine on their sorrowful talk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been mercifully brought about, that
I was to have you to speak to,&rsquo; pursued Rachael,
&lsquo;times are, when I think my mind would not have kept
right.&nbsp; But I get hope and strength through you; and you
believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be
proved clear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do believe so,&rsquo; returned Sissy, &lsquo;with my
whole heart.&nbsp; I feel so certain, Rachael, that the
confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not
like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him than if I had
known him through as many years of trial as you have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I, my dear,&rsquo; said Rachel, with a tremble in
her voice, &lsquo;have known him through them all, to be,
according to his quiet ways, so faithful to everything honest and
good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and I was to live
to be a hundred years old, I could say with my last breath, God
knows my heart.&nbsp; I have never once left trusting Stephen
Blackpool!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he will
be freed from suspicion, sooner or later.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The better I know it to be so believed there, my
dear,&rsquo; said Rachael, &lsquo;and the kinder I feel it that
you come away from there, purposely to comfort me, and keep me
company, and be seen wi&rsquo; me when I am not yet free from all
suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever have
spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.&nbsp; And yet
I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mistrust her now, Rachael?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that you have brought us more together, no.&nbsp;
But I can&rsquo;t at all times keep out of my
mind&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself,
that Sissy, sitting by her side, was obliged to listen with
attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t at all times keep out of my mind,
mistrustings of some one.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think who
&rsquo;tis, I can&rsquo;t think how or why it may be done, but I
mistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way.&nbsp; I
mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord, and showing
himself innocent before them all, some one would be confounded,
who&mdash;to prevent that&mdash;has stopped him, and put him out
of the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a dreadful thought,&rsquo; said Sissy, turning
pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It <i>is</i> a dreadful thought to think he may be
murdered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sissy shuddered, and turned paler yet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When it makes its way into my mind, dear,&rsquo; said
Rachael, &lsquo;and it will come sometimes, though I do all I can
to keep it out, wi&rsquo; counting on to high numbers as I work,
and saying over and over again pieces that I knew when I were a
child&mdash;I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however
tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles.&nbsp; I must
get the better of this before bed-time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll walk
home wi&rsquo; you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He might fall ill upon the journey back,&rsquo; said
Sissy, faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope; &lsquo;and in
such a case, there are many places on the road where he might
stop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he is in none of them.&nbsp; He has been sought for
in all, and he&rsquo;s not there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; was Sissy&rsquo;s reluctant admission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;d walk the journey in two days.&nbsp; If he
was footsore and couldn&rsquo;t walk, I sent him, in the letter
he got, the money to ride, lest he should have none of his own to
spare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better,
Rachael.&nbsp; Come into the air!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her gentle hand adjusted Rachael&rsquo;s shawl upon her
shining black hair in the usual manner of her wearing it, and
they went out.&nbsp; The night being fine, little knots of Hands
were here and there lingering at street corners; but it was
supper-time with the greater part of them, and there were but few
people in the streets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not so hurried now, Rachael, and your hand
is cooler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I get better, dear, if I can only walk, and breathe a
little fresh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Times when I can&rsquo;t, I turn weak
and confused.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you must not begin to fail, Rachael, for you may be
wanted at any time to stand by Stephen.&nbsp; To-morrow is
Saturday.&nbsp; If no news comes to-morrow, let us walk in the
country on Sunday morning, and strengthen you for another
week.&nbsp; Will you go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were by this time in the street where Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s house stood.&nbsp; The way to Sissy&rsquo;s
destination led them past the door, and they were going straight
towards it.&nbsp; Some train had newly arrived in Coketown, which
had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scattered a
considerable bustle about the town.&nbsp; Several coaches were
rattling before them and behind them as they approached Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s, and one of the latter drew up with such
briskness as they were in the act of passing the house, that they
looked round involuntarily.&nbsp; The bright gaslight over Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in
an ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs.
Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called to them to
stop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a coincidence,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Sparsit, as she was released by the coachman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a Providence!&nbsp; Come out,
ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one inside,
&lsquo;come out, or we&rsquo;ll have you dragged out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman
descended.&nbsp; Whom Mrs. Sparsit incontinently collared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave her alone, everybody!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Sparsit,
with great energy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let nobody touch her.&nbsp; She
belongs to me.&nbsp; Come in, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; then said Mrs.
Sparsit, reversing her former word of command.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
in, ma&rsquo;am, or we&rsquo;ll have you dragged in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an
ancient woman by the throat, and hauling her into a
dwelling-house, would have been under any circumstances,
sufficient temptation to all true English stragglers so blest as
to witness it, to force a way into that dwelling-house and see
the matter out.&nbsp; But when the phenomenon was enhanced by the
notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over the town
with the Bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in,
with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been
expected to fall upon their heads.&nbsp; Accordingly, the chance
witnesses on the ground, consisting of the busiest of the
neighbours to the number of some five-and-twenty, closed in after
Sissy and Rachael, as they closed in after Mrs. Sparsit and her
prize; and the whole body made a disorderly irruption into Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s dining-room, where the people behind lost not a
moment&rsquo;s time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better
of the people in front.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fetch Mr. Bounderby down!&rsquo; cried Mrs.
Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rachael, young woman; you know who this
is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Pegler,&rsquo; said Rachael.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think it is!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Sparsit,
exulting.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fetch Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; Stand away,
everybody!&rsquo;&nbsp; Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling herself
up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of
entreaty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Sparsit, aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have told you twenty times, coming
along, that I will <i>not</i> leave you till I have handed you
over to him myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and
the whelp, with whom he had been holding conference
up-stairs.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby looked more astonished than
hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his
dining-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter now!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mrs. Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; explained that worthy woman, &lsquo;I trust
it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired
to find.&nbsp; Stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind, sir,
and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the
country in which that person might be supposed to reside, as have
been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now
present to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to
bring that person with me&mdash;I need not say most unwillingly
on her part.&nbsp; It has not been, sir, without some trouble
that I have effected this; but trouble in your service is to me a
pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold a real
gratification.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Sparsit ceased; for Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s visage
exhibited an extraordinary combination of all possible colours
and expressions of discomfiture, as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed
to his view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what do you mean by this?&rsquo; was his highly
unexpected demand, in great warmth.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ask you, what
do you mean by this, Mrs. Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, faintly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you mind your own business,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; roared Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;How dare you
go and poke your officious nose into my family
affairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This allusion to her favourite feature overpowered Mrs.
Sparsit.&nbsp; She sat down stiffly in a chair, as if she were
frozen; and with a fixed stare at Mr. Bounderby, slowly grated
her mittens against one another, as if they were frozen too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Josiah!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Pegler,
trembling.&nbsp; &lsquo;My darling boy!&nbsp; I am not to
blame.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not my fault, Josiah.&nbsp; I told this
lady over and over again, that I knew she was doing what would
not be agreeable to you, but she would do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you let her bring you for?&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t you knock her cap off, or her tooth out, or
scratch her, or do something or other to her?&rsquo; asked
Bounderby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My own boy!&nbsp; She threatened me that if I resisted
her, I should be brought by constables, and it was better to come
quietly than make that stir in such a&rsquo;&mdash;Mrs. Pegler
glanced timidly but proudly round the walls&mdash;&lsquo;such a
fine house as this.&nbsp; Indeed, indeed, it is not my
fault!&nbsp; My dear, noble, stately boy!&nbsp; I have always
lived quiet, and secret, Josiah, my dear.&nbsp; I have never
broken the condition once.&nbsp; I have never said I was your
mother.&nbsp; I have admired you at a distance; and if I have
come to town sometimes, with long times between, to take a proud
peep at you, I have done it unbeknown, my love, and gone away
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked in
impatient mortification up and down at the side of the long
dining-table, while the spectators greedily took in every
syllable of Mrs. Pegler&rsquo;s appeal, and at each succeeding
syllable became more and more round-eyed.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby
still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr.
Gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am surprised, madam,&rsquo; he observed with
severity, &lsquo;that in your old age you have the face to claim
Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your unnatural and inhuman
treatment of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Me</i> unnatural!&rsquo; cried poor old Mrs.
Pegler.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Me</i> inhuman!&nbsp; To my dear
boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear!&rsquo; repeated Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes;
dear in his self-made prosperity, madam, I dare say.&nbsp; Not
very dear, however, when you deserted him in his infancy, and
left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> deserted my Josiah!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Pegler,
clasping her hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Lord forgive you, sir, for
your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal against the memory
of my poor mother, who died in my arms before Josiah was
born.&nbsp; May you repent of it, sir, and live to know
better!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind,
shocked by the possibility which dawned upon him, said in a
gentler tone:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son
to&mdash;to be brought up in the gutter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Josiah in the gutter!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Pegler.&nbsp; &lsquo;No such a thing, sir.&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; For
shame on you!&nbsp; My dear boy knows, and will give <i>you</i>
to know, that though he come of humble parents, he come of
parents that loved him as dear as the best could, and never
thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might
write and cipher beautiful, and I&rsquo;ve his books at home to
show it!&nbsp; Aye, have I!&rsquo; said Mrs. Pegler, with
indignant pride.&nbsp; &lsquo;And my dear boy knows, and will
give <i>you</i> to know, sir, that after his beloved father died,
when he was eight years old, his mother, too, could pinch a bit,
as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it, to
help him out in life, and put him &rsquo;prentice.&nbsp; And a
steady lad he was, and a kind master he had to lend him a hand,
and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and
thriving.&nbsp; And <i>I</i>&rsquo;ll give you to know,
sir&mdash;for this my dear boy won&rsquo;t&mdash;that though his
mother kept but a little village shop, he never forgot her, but
pensioned me on thirty pound a year&mdash;more than I want, for I
put by out of it&mdash;only making the condition that I was to
keep down in my own part, and make no boasts about him, and not
trouble him.&nbsp; And I never have, except with looking at him
once a year, when he has never knowed it.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s
right,&rsquo; said poor old Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate
championship, &lsquo;that I <i>should</i> keep down in my own
part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a many
unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my
pride in my Josiah to myself, and I can love for love&rsquo;s own
sake!&nbsp; And I am ashamed of you, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Pegler, lastly, &lsquo;for your slanders and suspicions.&nbsp;
And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand here
when my dear son said no.&nbsp; And I shouldn&rsquo;t be here
now, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for being brought here.&nbsp; And
for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to accuse me of being a bad
mother to my son, with my son standing here to tell you so
different!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a
murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt
himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament, when
Mr. Bounderby, who had never ceased walking up and down, and had
every moment swelled larger and larger, and grown redder and
redder, stopped short.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rsquo; said Mr. Bounderby,
&lsquo;how I come to be favoured with the attendance of the
present company, but I don&rsquo;t inquire.&nbsp; When
they&rsquo;re quite satisfied, perhaps they&rsquo;ll be so good
as to disperse; whether they&rsquo;re satisfied or not, perhaps
they&rsquo;ll be so good as to disperse.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, I have not
undertaken to do it, and I&rsquo;m not a going to do it.&nbsp;
Therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that
branch of the subject, will be disappointed&mdash;particularly
Tom Gradgrind, and he can&rsquo;t know it too soon.&nbsp; In
reference to the Bank robbery, there has been a mistake made,
concerning my mother.&nbsp; If there hadn&rsquo;t been
over-officiousness it wouldn&rsquo;t have been made, and I hate
over-officiousness at all times, whether or no. Good
evening!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding
the door open for the company to depart, there was a blustering
sheepishness upon him, at once extremely crestfallen and
superlatively absurd.&nbsp; Detected as the Bully of humility,
who had built his windy reputation upon lies, and in his
boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if
he had advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack
himself on to a pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure.&nbsp;
With the people filing off at the door he held, who he knew would
carry what had passed to the whole town, to be given to the four
winds, he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn,
if he had had his ears cropped.&nbsp; Even that unlucky female,
Mrs. Sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into the
Slough of Despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable
man and self-made Humbug, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.</p>
<p>Rachael and Sissy, leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her
son&rsquo;s for that night, walked together to the gate of Stone
Lodge and there parted.&nbsp; Mr. Gradgrind joined them before
they had gone very far, and spoke with much interest of Stephen
Blackpool; for whom he thought this signal failure of the
suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well.</p>
<p>As to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late
occasions, he had stuck close to Bounderby.&nbsp; He seemed to
feel that as long as Bounderby could make no discovery without
his knowledge, he was so far safe.&nbsp; He never visited his
sister, and had only seen her once since she went home: that is
to say on the night when he still stuck close to Bounderby, as
already related.</p>
<p>There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his
sister&rsquo;s mind, to which she never gave utterance, which
surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful
mystery.&nbsp; The same dark possibility had presented itself in
the same shapeless guise, this very day, to Sissy, when Rachael
spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen&rsquo;s
return, having put him out of the way.&nbsp; Louisa had never
spoken of harbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion
with the robbery, she and Sissy had held no confidence on the
subject, save in that one interchange of looks when the
unconscious father rested his gray head on his hand; but it was
understood between them, and they both knew it.&nbsp; This <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>other fear
was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a ghostly
shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far
less of its being near the other.</p>
<p>And still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up,
throve with him.&nbsp; If Stephen Blackpool was not the thief,
let him show himself.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>Another night.&nbsp; Another day and night.&nbsp; No Stephen
Blackpool.&nbsp; Where was the man, and why did he not come
back?</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE STARLIGHT</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sunday was a bright Sunday in
autumn, clear and cool, when early in the morning Sissy and
Rachael met, to walk in the country.</p>
<p>As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the
neighbourhood&rsquo;s too&mdash;after the manner of those pious
persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people
into sackcloth&mdash;it was customary for those who now and then
thirsted for a draught of pure air, which is not absolutely the
most wicked among the vanities of life, to get a few miles away
by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their lounge in
the fields.&nbsp; Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the
smoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about
midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s retreat.</p>
<p>Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with
heaps of coal, it was green elsewhere, and there were trees to
see, and there were larks singing (though it was Sunday), and
there were pleasant scents in the air, and all was over-arched by
a bright blue sky.&nbsp; In the distance one way, Coketown showed
as a black mist; in another distance hills began to rise; in a
third, there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where
it shone upon the far-off sea.&nbsp; Under their feet, the grass
was fresh; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it, and
speckled it; hedgerows were luxuriant; everything was at
peace.&nbsp; Engines at pits&rsquo; mouths, and lean old horses
that had worn the circle of their daily labour into the ground,
were alike quiet; wheels had ceased for a short space to turn;
and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the shocks
and noises of another time.</p>
<p>They walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes,
sometimes getting over a fragment of a fence so rotten that it
dropped at a touch of the foot, sometimes passing near a wreck of
bricks and beams overgrown with grass, marking the site of
deserted works.&nbsp; They followed paths and tracks, however
slight.&nbsp; Mounds where the grass was rank and high, and where
brambles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were confusedly
heaped together, they always avoided; for dismal stories were
told in that country of the old pits hidden beneath such
indications.</p>
<p>The sun was high when they sat down to rest.&nbsp; They had
seen no one, near or distant, for a long time; and the solitude
remained unbroken.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is so still here, Rachael, and
the way is so untrodden, that I think we must be the first who
have been here all the summer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Sissy said it, her eyes were attracted by another of those
rotten fragments of fence upon the ground.&nbsp; She got up to
look at it.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; This
has not been broken very long.&nbsp; The wood is quite fresh
where it gave way.&nbsp; Here are footsteps too.&mdash;O
Rachael!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She ran back, and caught her round the neck.&nbsp; Rachael had
already started up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; There is a hat lying in the
grass.&rsquo;&nbsp; They went forward together.&nbsp; Rachael
took it up, shaking from head to foot.&nbsp; She broke into a
passion of tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written
in his own hand on the inside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O the poor lad, the poor lad!&nbsp; He has been made
away with.&nbsp; He is lying murdered here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there&mdash;has the hat any blood upon it?&rsquo;
Sissy faltered.</p>
<p>They were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found
no mark of violence, inside or out.&nbsp; It had been lying there
some days, for rain and dew had stained it, and the mark of its
shape was on the grass where it had fallen.&nbsp; They looked
fearfully about them, without moving, but could see nothing
more.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rachael,&rsquo; Sissy whispered, &lsquo;I will
go on a little by myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping
forward, when Rachael caught her in both arms with a scream that
resounded over the wide landscape.&nbsp; Before them, at their
very feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the
thick grass.&nbsp; They sprang back, and fell upon their knees,
each hiding her face upon the other&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my good Lord!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s down there!&nbsp;
Down there!&rsquo;&nbsp; At first this, and her terrific screams,
were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears, by any
prayers, by any representations, by any means.&nbsp; It was
impossible to hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her,
or she would have flung herself down the shaft.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of
Heaven, not these dreadful cries!&nbsp; Think of Stephen, think
of Stephen, think of Stephen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all
the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be
silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of stone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachael, Stephen may be living.&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this
dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stir from here, for his sake!&nbsp; Let me
go and listen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on
her hands and knees, and called to him as loud as she could
call.&nbsp; She listened, but no sound replied.&nbsp; She called
again and listened; still no answering sound.&nbsp; She did this,
twenty, thirty times.&nbsp; She took a little clod of earth from
the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in.&nbsp;
She could not hear it fall.</p>
<p>The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few
minutes ago, almost carried despair to her brave heart, as she
rose and looked all round her, seeing no help.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Rachael, we must lose not a moment.&nbsp; We must go in
different directions, seeking aid.&nbsp; You shall go by the way
we have come, and I will go forward by the path.&nbsp; Tell any
one you see, and every one what has happened.&nbsp; Think of
Stephen, think of Stephen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She knew by Rachael&rsquo;s face that she might trust her
now.&nbsp; And after standing for a moment to see her running,
wringing her hands as she ran, she turned and went upon her own
search; she stopped at the hedge to tie her shawl there as a
guide to the place, then threw her bonnet aside, and ran as she
had never run before.</p>
<p>Run, Sissy, run, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
stop for breath.&nbsp; Run, run!&nbsp; Quickening herself by
carrying such entreaties in her thoughts, she ran from field to
field, and lane to lane, and place to place, as she had never run
before; until she came to a shed by an engine-house, where two
men lay in the shade, asleep on straw.</p>
<p>First to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild and
breathless as she was, what had brought her there, were
difficulties; but they no sooner understood her than their
spirits were on fire like hers.&nbsp; One of the men was in a
drunken slumber, but on his comrade&rsquo;s shouting to him that
a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he started out to a
pool of dirty water, put his head in it, and came back sober.</p>
<p>With these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further, and
with that one to another, while they ran elsewhere.&nbsp; Then a
horse was found; and she got another man to ride for life or
death to the railroad, and send a message to Louisa, which she
wrote and gave him.&nbsp; By this time a whole village was up:
and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all things
necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place,
to be carried to the Old Hell Shaft.</p>
<p>It seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man
lying in the grave where he had been buried alive.&nbsp; She
could not bear to remain away from it any longer&mdash;it was
like deserting him&mdash;and she hurried swiftly back,
accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, including the drunken man
whom the news had sobered, and who was the best man of all.&nbsp;
When they came to the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as
she had left it.&nbsp; The men called and listened as she had
done, and examined the edge of the chasm, and settled how it had
happened, and then sat down to wait until the implements they
wanted should come up.</p>
<p>Every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the
leaves, every whisper among these men, made Sissy tremble, for
she thought it was a cry at the bottom of the pit.&nbsp; But the
wind blew idly over it, and no sound arose to the surface, and
they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting.&nbsp; After they
had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the
accident began to come up; then the real help of implements began
to arrive.&nbsp; In the midst of this, Rachael returned; and with
her party there was a surgeon, who brought some wine and
medicines.&nbsp; But, the expectation among the people that the
man would be found alive was very slight indeed.</p>
<p>There being now people enough present to impede the work, the
sobered man put himself at the head of the rest, or was put there
by the general consent, and made a large ring round the Old Hell
Shaft, and appointed men to keep it.&nbsp; Besides such
volunteers as were accepted to work, only Sissy and Rachael were
at first permitted within this ring; but, later in the day, when
the message brought an express from Coketown, Mr. Gradgrind and
Louisa, and Mr. Bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.</p>
<p>The sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and Rachael had
first sat down upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men
to descend securely was rigged with poles and ropes.&nbsp;
Difficulties had arisen in the construction of this machine,
simple as it was; requisites had been found wanting, and messages
had had to go and return.&nbsp; It was five o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday, before a candle was sent
down to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood
crowded close together, attentively watching it: the man at the
windlass lowering as they were told.&nbsp; The candle was brought
up again, feebly burning, and then some water was cast in.&nbsp;
Then the bucket was hooked on; and the sobered man and another
got in with lights, giving the word &lsquo;Lower away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the rope went out, tight and strained, and the windlass
creaked, there was not a breath among the one or two hundred men
and women looking on, that came as it was wont to come.&nbsp; The
signal was given and the windlass stopped, with abundant rope to
spare.&nbsp; Apparently so long an interval ensued with the men
at the windlass standing idle, that some women shrieked that
another accident had happened!&nbsp; But the surgeon who held the
watch, declared five minutes not to have elapsed yet, and sternly
admonished them to keep silence.&nbsp; He had not well done
speaking, when the windlass was reversed and worked again.&nbsp;
Practised eyes knew that it did not go as heavily as it would if
both workmen had been coming up, and that only one was
returning.</p>
<p>The rope came in tight and strained; and ring after ring was
coiled upon the barrel of the windlass, and all eyes were
fastened on the pit.&nbsp; The sobered man was brought up and
leaped out briskly on the grass.&nbsp; There was an universal cry
of &lsquo;Alive or dead?&rsquo; and then a deep, profound
hush.</p>
<p>When he said &lsquo;Alive!&rsquo; a great shout arose and many
eyes had tears in them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he&rsquo;s hurt very bad,&rsquo; he added, as soon
as he could make himself heard again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s
doctor?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s hurt so very bad, sir, that we donno how
to get him up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They all consulted together, and looked anxiously at the
surgeon, as he asked some questions, and shook his head on
receiving the replies.&nbsp; The sun was setting now; and the red
light in the evening sky touched every face there, and caused it
to be distinctly seen in all its rapt suspense.</p>
<p>The consultation ended in the men returning to the windlass,
and the pitman going down again, carrying the wine and some other
small matters with him.&nbsp; Then the other man came up.&nbsp;
In the meantime, under the surgeon&rsquo;s directions, some men
brought a hurdle, on which others made a thick bed of spare
clothes covered with loose straw, while he himself contrived some
bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs.&nbsp; As these
were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last
come up, with instructions how to use them: and as he stood,
shown by the light he carried, leaning his powerful loose hand
upon one of the poles, and sometimes glancing down the pit, and
sometimes glancing round upon the people, he was not the least
conspicuous figure in the scene.&nbsp; It was dark now, and
torches were kindled.</p>
<p>It appeared from the little this man said to those about him,
which was quickly repeated all over the circle, that the lost man
had fallen upon a mass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was
half choked up, and that his fall had been further broken by some
jagged earth at the side.&nbsp; He lay upon his back with one arm
doubled under him, and according to his own belief had hardly
stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his free hand to
a side pocket, in which he remembered to have some bread and meat
(of which he had swallowed crumbs), and had likewise scooped up a
little water in it now and then.&nbsp; He had come straight away
from his work, on being written to, and had walked the whole
journey; and was on his way to Mr. Bounderby&rsquo;s country
house after dark, when he fell.&nbsp; He was crossing that
dangerous country at such a dangerous time, because he was
innocent of what was laid to his charge, and couldn&rsquo;t rest
from coming the nearest way to deliver himself up.&nbsp; The Old
Hell Shaft, the pitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of
its bad name to the last; for though Stephen could speak now, he
believed it would soon be found to have mangled the life out of
him.</p>
<p>When all was ready, this man, still taking his last hurried
charges from his comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had
begun to lower him, disappeared into the pit.&nbsp; The rope went
out as before, the signal was made as before, and the windlass
stopped.&nbsp; No man removed his hand from it now.&nbsp; Every
one waited with his grasp set, and his body bent down to the
work, ready to reverse and wind in.&nbsp; At length the signal
was given, and all the ring leaned forward.</p>
<p>For, now, the rope came in, tightened and strained to its
utmost as it appeared, and the men turned heavily, and the
windlass complained.&nbsp; It was scarcely endurable to look at
the rope, and think of its giving way.&nbsp; But, ring after ring
was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass safely, and the
connecting chains appeared, and finally the bucket with the two
men holding on at the sides&mdash;a sight to make the head swim,
and oppress the heart&mdash;and tenderly supporting between them,
slung and tied within, the figure of a poor, crushed, human
creature.</p>
<p>A low murmur of pity went round the throng, and the women wept
aloud, as this form, almost without form, was moved very slowly
from its iron deliverance, and laid upon the bed of straw.&nbsp;
At first, none but the surgeon went close to it.&nbsp; He did
what he could in its adjustment on the couch, but the best that
he could do was to cover it.&nbsp; That gently done, he called to
him Rachael and Sissy.&nbsp; And at that time the pale, worn,
patient face was seen looking up at the sky, with the broken
right hand lying bare on the outside of the covering garments, as
if waiting to be taken by another hand.</p>
<p>They gave him drink, moistened his face with water, and
administered some drops of cordial and wine.&nbsp; Though he lay
quite motionless looking up at the sky, he smiled and said,
&lsquo;Rachael.&rsquo;&nbsp; She stooped down on the grass at his
side, and bent over him until her eyes were between his and the
sky, for he could not so much as turn them to look at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachael, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took his hand.&nbsp; He smiled again and said,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;t go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;rt in great pain, my own dear
Stephen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha&rsquo; been, but not now.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo;
been&mdash;dreadful, and dree, and <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>long, my dear&mdash;but &rsquo;tis
ower now.&nbsp; Ah, Rachael, aw a muddle!&nbsp; Fro&rsquo; first
to last, a muddle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said the
word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ha&rsquo; fell into th&rsquo; pit, my dear, as have
cost wi&rsquo;in the knowledge o&rsquo; old fok now livin,
hundreds and hundreds o&rsquo; men&rsquo;s lives&mdash;fathers,
sons, brothers, dear to thousands an&rsquo; thousands, an&rsquo;
keeping &rsquo;em fro&rsquo; want and hunger.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo;
fell into a pit that ha&rsquo; been wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; Firedamp
crueller than battle.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; read on &rsquo;t in the
public petition, as onny one may read, fro&rsquo; the men that
works in pits, in which they ha&rsquo; pray&rsquo;n and
pray&rsquo;n the lawmakers for Christ&rsquo;s sake not to let
their work be murder to &rsquo;em, but to spare &rsquo;em for
th&rsquo; wives and children that they loves as well as gentlefok
loves theirs.&nbsp; When it were in work, it killed wi&rsquo;out
need; when &rsquo;tis let alone, it kills wi&rsquo;out
need.&nbsp; See how we die an&rsquo; no need, one way an&rsquo;
another&mdash;in a muddle&mdash;every day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He faintly said it, without any anger against any one.&nbsp;
Merely as the truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thy little sister, Rachael, thou hast not forgot
her.&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;rt not like to forget her now, and me so
nigh her.&nbsp; Thou know&rsquo;st&mdash;poor, patient,
suff&rsquo;rin, dear&mdash;how thou didst work for her,
seet&rsquo;n all day long in her little chair at thy winder, and
how she died, young and misshapen, awlung o&rsquo; sickly air as
had&rsquo;n no need to be, an&rsquo; awlung o&rsquo; working
people&rsquo;s miserable homes.&nbsp; A muddle!&nbsp; Aw a
muddle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa approached him; but he could not see her, lying with
his face turned up to the night sky.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If aw th&rsquo; things that tooches us, my dear, was
not so muddled, I should&rsquo;n ha&rsquo; had&rsquo;n need to
coom heer.&nbsp; If we was not in a muddle among ourseln, I
should&rsquo;n ha&rsquo; been, by my own fellow weavers and
workin&rsquo; brothers, so mistook.&nbsp; If Mr. Bounderby had
ever know&rsquo;d me right&mdash;if he&rsquo;d ever know&rsquo;d
me at aw&mdash;he would&rsquo;n ha&rsquo; took&rsquo;n offence
wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; He would&rsquo;n ha&rsquo; suspect&rsquo;n
me.&nbsp; But look up yonder, Rachael!&nbsp; Look
aboove!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following his eyes, she saw that he was gazing at a star.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It ha&rsquo; shined upon me,&rsquo; he said reverently,
&lsquo;in my pain and trouble down below.&nbsp; It ha&rsquo;
shined into my mind.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; look&rsquo;n at &rsquo;t
and thowt o&rsquo; thee, Rachael, till the muddle in my mind have
cleared awa, above a bit, I hope.&nbsp; If soom ha&rsquo; been
wantin&rsquo; in unnerstan&rsquo;in me better, I, too, ha&rsquo;
been wantin&rsquo; in unnerstan&rsquo;in them better.&nbsp; When
I got thy letter, I easily believen that what the yoong ledy sen
and done to me, and what her brother sen and done to me, was one,
and that there were a wicked plot betwixt &rsquo;em.&nbsp; When I
fell, I were in anger wi&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; hurryin on
t&rsquo; be as onjust t&rsquo; her as oothers was t&rsquo;
me.&nbsp; But in our judgments, like as in our doins, we mun bear
and forbear.&nbsp; In my pain an&rsquo; trouble, lookin up
yonder,&mdash;wi&rsquo; it shinin on me&mdash;I ha&rsquo; seen
more clear, and ha&rsquo; made it my dyin prayer that aw
th&rsquo; world may on&rsquo;y coom toogether more, an&rsquo; get
a better unnerstan&rsquo;in o&rsquo; one another, than when I
were in &rsquo;t my own weak seln.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa hearing what he said, bent over him on the opposite
side to Rachael, so that he could see her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ha&rsquo; heard?&rsquo; he said, after a few
moments&rsquo; silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ha&rsquo; not forgot you,
ledy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Stephen, I have heard you.&nbsp; And your prayer
is mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ha&rsquo; a father.&nbsp; Will yo tak&rsquo; a
message to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is here,&rsquo; said Louisa, with dread.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Shall I bring him to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If yo please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa returned with her father.&nbsp; Standing hand-in-hand,
they both looked down upon the solemn countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, yo will clear me an&rsquo; mak my name good
wi&rsquo; aw men.&nbsp; This I leave to yo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind was troubled and asked how?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; was the reply: &lsquo;yor son will tell yo
how.&nbsp; Ask him.&nbsp; I mak no charges: I leave none ahint
me: not a single word.&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; seen an&rsquo;
spok&rsquo;n wi&rsquo; yor son, one night.&nbsp; I ask no more
o&rsquo; yo than that yo clear me&mdash;an&rsquo; I trust to yo
to do &rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon
being anxious for his removal, those who had torches or lanterns,
prepared to go in front of the litter.&nbsp; Before it was
raised, and while they were arranging how to go, he said to
Rachael, looking upward at the star:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Often as I coom to myseln, and found it shinin&rsquo;
on me down there in my trouble, I thowt it were the star as
guided to Our Saviour&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; I awmust think it be
the very star!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that they
were about to take him in the direction whither the star seemed
to him to lead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachael, beloved lass!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let go my
hand.&nbsp; We may walk toogether t&rsquo;night, my
dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, Stephen,
all the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless thee!&nbsp; Will soombody be pleased to coover my
face!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They carried him very gently along the fields, and down the
lanes, and over the wide landscape; Rachael always holding the
hand in hers.&nbsp; Very few whispers broke the mournful
silence.&nbsp; It was soon a funeral procession.&nbsp; The star
had shown him where to find the God of the poor; and through
humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his
Redeemer&rsquo;s rest.</p>

208</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WHELP-HUNTING</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the ring formed round the
Old Hell Shaft was broken, one figure had disappeared from within
it.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa,
who held her father&rsquo;s arm, but in a retired place by
themselves.&nbsp; When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to the couch,
Sissy, attentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked
shadow&mdash;a sight in the horror of his face, if there had been
eyes there for any sight but one&mdash;and whispered in his
ear.&nbsp; Without turning his head, he conferred with her a few
moments, and vanished.&nbsp; Thus the whelp had gone out of the
circle before the people moved.</p>
<p>When the father reached home, he sent a message to Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s, desiring his son to come to him
directly.&nbsp; The reply was, that Mr. Bounderby having missed
him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him since, had supposed
him to be at Stone Lodge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe, father,&rsquo; said Louisa, &lsquo;he will
not come back to town to-night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gradgrind turned
away, and said no more.</p>
<p>In the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it
was opened, and seeing his son&rsquo;s place empty (he had not
the courage to look in at first) went back along the street to
meet Mr. Bounderby on his way there.&nbsp; To whom he said that,
for reasons he would soon explain, but entreated not then to be
asked for, he had found it necessary to employ his son at a
distance for a little while.&nbsp; Also, that he was charged with
the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool&rsquo;s memory, and
declaring the thief.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood
stock-still in the street after his father-in-law had left him,
swelling like an immense soap-bubble, without its beauty.</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept
it all that day.&nbsp; When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door,
he said, without opening it, &lsquo;Not now, my dears; in the
evening.&rsquo;&nbsp; On their return in the evening, he said,
&lsquo;I am not able yet&mdash;to-morrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; He ate
nothing all day, and had no candle after dark; and they heard him
walking to and fro late at night.</p>
<p>But, in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual
hour, and took his usual place at the table.&nbsp; Aged and bent
he looked, and quite bowed down; and yet he looked a wiser man,
and a better man, than in the days when in this life he wanted
nothing&mdash;but Facts.&nbsp; Before he left the room, he
appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray
head drooping, went away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear father,&rsquo; said Louisa, when they kept their
appointment, &lsquo;you have three young children left.&nbsp;
They will be different, I will be different yet, with
Heaven&rsquo;s help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave her hand to Sissy, as if she meant with her help
too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your wretched brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you think he had planned this robbery, when he went
with you to the lodging?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear so, father.&nbsp; I know he had wanted money
very much, and had spent a great deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor man being about to leave the town, it came
into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it must have flashed upon him while he sat
there, father.&nbsp; For I asked him to go there with me.&nbsp;
The visit did not originate with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had some conversation with the poor man.&nbsp; Did
he take him aside?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He took him out of the room.&nbsp; I asked him
afterwards, why he had done so, and he made a plausible excuse;
but since last night, father, and when I remember the
circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine too truly
what passed between them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me know,&rsquo; said her father, &lsquo;if your
thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear, father,&rsquo; hesitated Louisa, &lsquo;that he
must have made some representation to Stephen
Blackpool&mdash;perhaps in my name, perhaps in his
own&mdash;which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what
he had never done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or
three nights before he left the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too plain!&rsquo; returned the father.&nbsp; &lsquo;Too
plain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shaded his face, and remained silent for some
moments.&nbsp; Recovering himself, he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, how is he to be found?&nbsp; How is he to be
saved from justice?&nbsp; In the few hours that I can possibly
allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found
by us, and only by us?&nbsp; Ten thousand pounds could not effect
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sissy has effected it, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He raised his eyes to where she stood, like a good fairy in
his house, and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful
kindness, &lsquo;It is always you, my child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We had our fears,&rsquo; Sissy explained, glancing at
Louisa, &lsquo;before yesterday; and when I saw you brought to
the side of the litter last night, and heard what passed (being
close to Rachael all the time), I went to him when no one saw,
and said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me.&nbsp; See where
your father is.&nbsp; Escape at once, for his sake and your
own!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was in a tremble before I whispered to him,
and he started and trembled more then, and said, &ldquo;Where can
I go?&nbsp; I have very little money, and I don&rsquo;t know who
will hide me!&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought of father&rsquo;s old
circus.&nbsp; I have not forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this
time of year, and I read of him in a paper only the other
day.&nbsp; I told him to hurry there, and tell his name, and ask
Mr. Sleary to hide him till I came.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
to him before the morning,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And I saw him
shrink away among the people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank Heaven!&rsquo; exclaimed his father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He may be got abroad yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had
directed him was within three hours&rsquo; journey of Liverpool,
whence he could be swiftly dispatched to any part of the
world.&nbsp; But, caution being necessary in communicating with
him&mdash;for there was a greater danger every moment of his
being suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that
Mr. Bounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might
play a Roman part&mdash;it was consented that Sissy and Louisa
should repair to the place in question, by a circuitous course,
alone; and that the unhappy father, setting forth in an opposite
direction, should get round to the same bourne by another and
wider route.&nbsp; It was further agreed that he should not
present himself to Mr. Sleary, lest his intentions should be
mistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his
son to take flight anew; but, that the communication should be
left to Sissy and Louisa to open; and that they should inform the
cause of so much misery and disgrace, of his father&rsquo;s being
at hand and of the purpose for which they had come.&nbsp; When
these arrangements had been well considered and were fully
understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into
execution.&nbsp; Early in the afternoon, Mr. Gradgrind walked
direct from his own house into the country, to be taken up on the
line by which he was to travel; and at night the remaining two
set forth upon their different course, encouraged by not seeing
any face they knew.</p>
<p>The two travelled all night, except when they were left, for
odd numbers of minutes, at branch-places, up illimitable flights
of steps, or down wells&mdash;which was the only variety of those
branches&mdash;and, early in the morning, were turned out on a
swamp, a mile or two from the town they sought.&nbsp; From this
dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old postilion, who
happened to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly: and so were
smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs
lived: which, although not a magnificent or even savoury
approach, was, as is usual in such cases, the legitimate
highway.</p>
<p>The first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton
of Sleary&rsquo;s Circus.&nbsp; The company had departed for
another town more than twenty miles off, and had opened there
last night.&nbsp; The connection between the two places was by a
hilly turnpike-road, and the travelling on that road was very
slow.&nbsp; Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and no rest
(which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious
circumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills
of Sleary&rsquo;s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one
o&rsquo;clock when they stopped in the market-place.</p>
<p>A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that
very hour, was in course of announcement by the bellman as they
set their feet upon the stones of the street.&nbsp; Sissy
recommended that, to avoid making inquiries and attracting
attention in the town, they should present themselves to pay at
the door.&nbsp; If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he would be
sure to know her, and would proceed with discretion.&nbsp; If he
were not, he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what
he had done with the fugitive, would proceed with discretion
still.</p>
<p>Therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the
well-remembered booth.&nbsp; The flag with the inscription <span
class="smcap">Sleary&rsquo;s Horse-riding</span> was there; and
the Gothic niche was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there.&nbsp;
Master Kidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by
the wildest credulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the
invincible force of circumstances (and his beard), and, in the
capacity of a man who made himself generally useful, presided on
this occasion over the exchequer&mdash;having also a drum in
reserve, on which to expend his leisure moments and superfluous
forces.&nbsp; In the extreme sharpness of his look out for base
coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw
anything but money; so Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they
went in.</p>
<p>The Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled
with black spots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as
it is the favourite recreation of that monarch to do.&nbsp;
Sissy, though well acquainted with his Royal line, had no
personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his reign was
peaceful.&nbsp; Miss Josephine Sleary, in her celebrated graceful
Equestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown
(who humorously said Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary appeared,
leading her in.</p>
<p>Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long
whip-lash, and the Clown had only said, &lsquo;If you do it
again, I&rsquo;ll throw the horse at you!&rsquo; when Sissy was
recognised both by father and daughter.&nbsp; But they got
through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary,
saving for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into
his locomotive eye than into his fixed one.&nbsp; The performance
seemed a little long to Sissy and Louisa, particularly when it
stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary
(who said &lsquo;Indeed, sir!&rsquo; to all his observations in
the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two legs
sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs,
and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of
three legs, and threw &rsquo;em at four legs, who ran away with
one leg.&nbsp; For, although an ingenious Allegory relating to a
butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog, and a leg of mutton, this
narrative consumed time; and they were in great suspense.&nbsp;
At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her curtsey
amid great applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had
just warmed himself, and said, &lsquo;Now <i>I</i>&rsquo;ll have
a turn!&rsquo; when Sissy was touched on the shoulder, and
beckoned out.</p>
<p>She took Louisa with her; and they were received by Mr. Sleary
in a very little private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass
floor, and a wooden ceiling all aslant, on which the box company
stamped their approbation, as if they were coming through.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thethilia,&rsquo; said Mr. Sleary, who had brandy and
water at hand, &lsquo;it doth me good to thee you.&nbsp; You wath
alwayth a favourite with uth, and you&rsquo;ve done uth credith
thinth the old timeth I&rsquo;m thure.&nbsp; You mutht thee our
people, my dear, afore we thpeak of bithnith, or they&rsquo;ll
break their hearth&mdash;ethpethially the women.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;th Jothphine hath been and got married to E. W. B.
Childerth, and thee hath got a boy, and though he&rsquo;th only
three yearth old, he thtickth on to any pony you can bring
againtht him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;th named The Little Wonder of
Thcolathtic Equitation; and if you don&rsquo;t hear of that boy
at Athley&rsquo;th, you&rsquo;ll hear of him at Parith.&nbsp; And
you recollect Kidderminthter, that wath thought to be rather
thweet upon yourthelf?&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; He&rsquo;th married
too.&nbsp; Married a widder.&nbsp; Old enough to be hith
mother.&nbsp; Thee wath Tightrope, thee wath, and now
thee&rsquo;th nothing&mdash;on accounth of fat.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve got two children, tho we&rsquo;re thtrong in the
Fairy bithnith and the Nurthery dodge.&nbsp; If you wath to thee
our Children in the Wood, with their father and mother both a
dyin&rsquo; on a horthe&mdash;their uncle a retheiving of
&rsquo;em ath hith wardth, upon a horthe&mdash;themthelvth both a
goin&rsquo; a black-berryin&rsquo; on a horthe&mdash;and the
Robinth a coming in to cover &rsquo;em with leavth, upon a
horthe&mdash;you&rsquo;d thay it wath the completetht thing ath
ever you thet your eyeth on!&nbsp; And you remember Emma Gordon,
my dear, ath wath a&rsquo;motht a mother to you?&nbsp; Of courthe
you do; I needn&rsquo;t athk.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; Emma, thee lotht
her huthband.&nbsp; He wath throw&rsquo;d a heavy back-fall off a
Elephant in a thort of a Pagoda thing ath the Thultan of the
Indieth, and he never got the better of it; and thee married a
thecond time&mdash;married a Cheethemonger ath fell in love with
her from the front&mdash;and he&rsquo;th a Overtheer and
makin&rsquo; a fortun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These various changes, Mr. Sleary, very short of breath now,
related with great heartiness, and with a wonderful kind of
innocence, considering what a bleary and brandy-and-watery old
veteran he was.&nbsp; Afterwards he brought in Josephine, and E.
W. B. Childers (rather deeply lined in the jaws by daylight), and
the Little Wonder of Scholastic Equitation, and in a word, all
the company.&nbsp; Amazing creatures they were in Louisa&rsquo;s
eyes, so white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so
demonstrative of leg; but it was very agreeable to see them
crowding about Sissy, and very natural in Sissy to be unable to
refrain from tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; Now Thethilia hath kithd all the children,
and hugged all the women, and thaken handth all round with all
the men, clear, every one of you, and ring in the band for the
thecond part!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, Thethilia, I don&rsquo;t athk to know any thecreth,
but I thuppothe I may conthider thith to be Mith
Thquire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is his sister.&nbsp; Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And t&rsquo;other on&rsquo;th daughter.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;h what I mean.&nbsp; Hope I thee you well, mith.&nbsp;
And I hope the Thquire&rsquo;th well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father will be here soon,&rsquo; said Louisa,
anxious to bring him to the point.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is my brother
safe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thafe and thound!&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
want you jutht to take a peep at the Ring, mith, through
here.&nbsp; Thethilia, you know the dodgeth; find a thpy-hole for
yourthelf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They each looked through a chink in the boards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;h Jack the Giant Killer&mdash;piethe of
comic infant bithnith,&rsquo; said Sleary.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;th a property-houthe, you thee, for Jack to
hide in; there&rsquo;th my Clown with a thauthepan-lid and a
thpit, for Jack&rsquo;th thervant; there&rsquo;th little Jack
himthelf in a thplendid thoot of armour; there&rsquo;th two comic
black thervanth twithe ath big ath the houthe, to thtand by it
and to bring it in and clear it; and the Giant (a very
ecthpenthive bathket one), he an&rsquo;t on yet.&nbsp; Now, do
you thee &rsquo;em all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; they both said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at &rsquo;em again,&rsquo; said Sleary,
&lsquo;look at &rsquo;em well.&nbsp; You thee em all?&nbsp; Very
good.&nbsp; Now, mith;&rsquo; he put a form for them to sit on;
&lsquo;I have my opinionth, and the Thquire your father hath
hith.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to know what your brother&rsquo;th
been up to; ith better for me not to know.&nbsp; All I thay ith,
the Thquire hath thtood by Thethilia, and I&rsquo;ll thtand by
the Thquire.&nbsp; Your brother ith one them black
thervanth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa uttered an exclamation, partly of distress, partly of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ith a fact,&rsquo; said Sleary, &lsquo;and even
knowin&rsquo; it, you couldn&rsquo;t put your finger on
him.&nbsp; Let the Thquire come.&nbsp; I thall keep your brother
here after the performanth.&nbsp; I thant undreth him, nor yet
wath hith paint off.&nbsp; Let the Thquire come here after the
performanth, or come here yourthelf after the performanth, and
you thall find your brother, and have the whole plathe to talk to
him in.&nbsp; Never mind the lookth of him, ath long ath
he&rsquo;th well hid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained
Mr. Sleary no longer then.&nbsp; She left her love for her
brother, with her eyes full of tears; and she and Sissy went away
until later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.&nbsp; He too
had encountered no one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with
Sleary&rsquo;s assistance, of getting his disgraced son to
Liverpool in the night.&nbsp; As neither of the three could be
his companion without almost identifying him under any disguise,
he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust,
beseeching him to ship the bearer off at any cost, to North or
South America, or any distant part of the world to which he could
be the most speedily and privately dispatched.</p>
<p>This done, they walked about, waiting for the Circus to be
quite vacated; not only by the audience, but by the company and
by the horses.&nbsp; After watching it a long time, they saw Mr.
Sleary bring out a chair and sit down by the side-door, smoking;
as if that were his signal that they might approach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your thervant, Thquire,&rsquo; was his cautious
salutation as they passed in.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you want me
you&rsquo;ll find me here.&nbsp; You muthn&rsquo;t mind your thon
having a comic livery on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They all three went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn, on
the Clown&rsquo;s performing chair in the middle of the
ring.&nbsp; On one of the back benches, remote in the subdued
light and the strangeness of the place, sat the villainous whelp,
sulky to the last, whom he had the misery to call his son.</p>
<p>In a preposterous coat, like a beadle&rsquo;s, with cuffs and
flaps exaggerated to an unspeakable extent; in an immense
waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled shoes, and a mad cocked hat;
with nothing fitting him, and everything of coarse material,
moth-eaten and full of holes; with seams in his black face, where
fear and heat had started through the greasy composition daubed
all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously
shameful as the whelp in his comic livery, Mr. Gradgrind never
could by any other means have believed in, weighable and
measurable fact though it was.&nbsp; And one of his model
children had come to this!</p>
<p>At first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in
remaining up there by himself.&nbsp; Yielding at length, if any
concession so sullenly made can be called yielding, to the
entreaties of Sissy&mdash;for Louisa he disowned
altogether&mdash;he came down, bench by bench, until he stood in
the sawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible,
within its limits from where his father sat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was this done?&rsquo; asked the father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was what done?&rsquo; moodily answered the son.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This robbery,&rsquo; said the father, raising his voice
upon the word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up
ajar before I went away.&nbsp; I had had the key that was found,
made long before.&nbsp; I dropped it that morning, that it might
be supposed to have been used.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t take the
money all at once.&nbsp; I pretended to put my balance away every
night, but I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now you know all about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a thunderbolt had fallen on me,&rsquo; said the
father, &lsquo;it would have shocked me less than
this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rsquo; grumbled the son.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So many people are employed in situations of trust; so
many people, out of so many, will be dishonest.&nbsp; I have
heard you talk, a hundred times, of its being a law.&nbsp; How
can <i>I</i> help laws?&nbsp; You have comforted others with such
things, father.&nbsp; Comfort yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The father buried his face in his hands, and the son stood in
his disgraceful grotesqueness, biting straw: his hands, with the
black partly worn away inside, looking like the hands of a
monkey.&nbsp; The evening was fast closing in; and from time to
time, he turned the whites of his eyes restlessly and impatiently
towards his father.&nbsp; They were the only parts of his face
that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was so
thick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be got to Liverpool, and sent
abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I must.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be more miserable
anywhere,&rsquo; whimpered the whelp, &lsquo;than I have been
here, ever since I can remember.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind went to the door, and returned with Sleary, to
whom he submitted the question, How to get this deplorable object
away?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of it, Thquire.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;th not muth time to lothe, tho you muth thay yeth or
no.&nbsp; Ith over twenty mileth to the rail.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;th a coath in half an hour, that goeth <i>to</i> the
rail, &lsquo;purpothe to cath the mail train.&nbsp; That train
will take him right to Liverpool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But look at him,&rsquo; groaned Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Will any coach&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that he thould go in the comic
livery,&rsquo; said Sleary.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thay the word, and
I&rsquo;ll make a Jothkin of him, out of the wardrobe, in five
minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Jothkin&mdash;a Carter.&nbsp; Make up your mind
quick, Thquire.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be beer to feth.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve never met with nothing but beer ath&rsquo;ll ever
clean a comic blackamoor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind rapidly assented; Mr. Sleary rapidly turned out
from a box, a smock frock, a felt hat, and other essentials; the
whelp rapidly changed clothes behind a screen of baize; Mr.
Sleary rapidly brought beer, and washed him white again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Sleary, &lsquo;come along to the
coath, and jump up behind; I&rsquo;ll go with you there, and
they&rsquo;ll thuppothe you one of my people.&nbsp; Thay farewell
to your family, and tharp&rsquo;th the word.&rsquo;&nbsp; With
which he delicately retired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is your letter,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All necessary means <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>will be provided for you.&nbsp;
Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the shocking action
you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to which it has
led.&nbsp; Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive
you as I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and
their pathetic tone.&nbsp; But, when Louisa opened her arms, he
repulsed her afresh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to have anything to
say to you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all your love!&rsquo; he returned,
obdurately.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretty love!&nbsp; Leaving old Bounderby
to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and
going home just when I was in the greatest danger.&nbsp; Pretty
love that!&nbsp; Coming out with every word about our having gone
to that place, when you saw the net was gathering round me.&nbsp;
Pretty love that!&nbsp; You have regularly given me up.&nbsp; You
never cared for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tharp&rsquo;th the word!&rsquo; said Sleary, at the
door.</p>
<p>They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she
forgave him, and loved him still, and that he would one day be
sorry to have left her so, and glad to think of these her last
words, far away: when some one ran against them.&nbsp; Mr.
Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him while his sister
yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.</p>
<p>For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted,
his thin nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his
colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself
into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a
glow.&nbsp; There he stood, panting and heaving, as if he had
never stopped since the night, now long ago, when he had run them
down before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to interfere with your plans,&rsquo;
said Bitzer, shaking his head, &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t allow
myself to be done by horse-riders.&nbsp; I must have young Mr.
Tom; he mustn&rsquo;t be got away by horse-riders; here he is in
a smock frock, and I must have him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the collar, too, it seemed.&nbsp; For, so he took
possession of him.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PHILOSOPHICAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> went back into the booth,
Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders out.&nbsp; Bitzer,
still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in the
Ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the
twilight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bitzer,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and
miserably submissive to him, &lsquo;have you a heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The circulation, sir,&rsquo; returned Bitzer, smiling
at the oddity of the question, &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t be carried
on without one.&nbsp; No man, sir, acquainted with the facts
established by Harvey relating to the circulation of the blood,
can doubt that I have a heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it accessible,&rsquo; cried Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;to
any compassionate influence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is accessible to Reason, sir,&rsquo; returned the
excellent young man.&nbsp; &lsquo;And to nothing else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind&rsquo;s face
as white as the pursuer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What motive&mdash;even what motive in reason&mdash;can
you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth,&rsquo;
said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;and crushing his miserable
father?&nbsp; See his sister here.&nbsp; Pity us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; returned Bitzer, in a very business-like
and logical manner, &lsquo;since you ask me what motive I have in
reason, for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, it is only
reasonable to let you know.&nbsp; I have suspected young Mr. Tom
of this bank-robbery from the first.&nbsp; I had had my eye upon
him before that time, for I knew his ways.&nbsp; I have kept my
observations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got
ample proofs against him now, besides his running away, and
besides his own confession, which I was just in time to
overhear.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of watching your house
yesterday morning, and following you here.&nbsp; I am going to
take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over
to Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp; Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr.
Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom&rsquo;s
situation.&nbsp; And I wish to have his situation, sir, for it
will be a rise to me, and will do me good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If this is solely a question of self-interest with
you&mdash;&rsquo; Mr. Gradgrind began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,&rsquo;
returned Bitzer; &lsquo;but I am sure you know that the whole
social system is a question of self-interest.&nbsp; What you must
always appeal to, is a person&rsquo;s self-interest.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s your only hold.&nbsp; We are so constituted.&nbsp; I
was brought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as
you are aware.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What sum of money,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind,
&lsquo;will you set against your expected promotion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; returned Bitzer, &lsquo;for
hinting at the proposal; but I will not set any sum against
it.&nbsp; Knowing that your clear head would propose that
alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I
find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed,
would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in
the Bank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bitzer,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his
hands as though he would have said, See how miserable I am!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bitzer, I have but one chance left to soften you.&nbsp;
You were many years at my school.&nbsp; If, in remembrance of the
pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any
degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I
entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that
remembrance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really wonder, sir,&rsquo; rejoined the old pupil in
an argumentative manner, &lsquo;to find you taking a position so
untenable.&nbsp; My schooling was paid for; it was a bargain; and
when I came away, the bargain ended.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy
that everything was to be paid for.&nbsp; Nobody was ever on any
account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without
purchase.&nbsp; Gratitude was to be abolished, and the virtues
springing from it were not to be.&nbsp; Every inch of the
existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a bargain
across a counter.&nbsp; And if we didn&rsquo;t get to Heaven that
way, it was not a politico-economical place, and we had no
business there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deny,&rsquo; added Bitzer, &lsquo;that my
schooling was cheap.&nbsp; But that comes right, sir.&nbsp; I was
made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose of myself in the
dearest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a little troubled here, by Louisa and Sissy crying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s of no use doing that: it only worries.&nbsp;
You seem to think that I have some animosity against young Mr.
Tom; whereas I have none at all.&nbsp; I am only going, on the
reasonable grounds I have mentioned, to take him back to
Coketown.&nbsp; If he was to resist, I should set up the cry of
Stop thief!&nbsp; But, he won&rsquo;t resist, you may depend upon
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sleary, who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as
immovably jammed in his head as his fixed one, had listened to
these doctrines with profound attention, here stepped
forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thquire, you know perfectly well, and your daughter
knowth perfectly well (better than you, becauthe I thed it to
her), that I didn&rsquo;t know what your thon had done, and that
I didn&rsquo;t want to know&mdash;I thed it wath better not,
though I only thought, then, it wath thome thkylarking.&nbsp;
However, thith young man having made it known to be a robbery of
a bank, why, that&rsquo;h a theriouth thing; muth too theriouth a
thing for me to compound, ath thith young man hath very properly
called it.&nbsp; Conthequently, Thquire, you muthn&rsquo;t
quarrel with me if I take thith young man&rsquo;th thide, and
thay he&rsquo;th right and there&rsquo;th no help for it.&nbsp;
But I tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Thquire; I&rsquo;ll drive your
thon and thith young man over to the rail, and prevent expothure
here.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t conthent to do more, but I&rsquo;ll do
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fresh lamentations from Louisa, and deeper affliction on Mr.
Gradgrind&rsquo;s part, followed this desertion of them by their
last friend.&nbsp; But, Sissy glanced at him with great
attention; nor did she in her own breast misunderstand him.&nbsp;
As they were all going out again, he favoured her with one slight
roll of his movable eye, desiring her to linger behind.&nbsp; As
he locked the door, he said excitedly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Thquire thtood by you, Thethilia, and I&rsquo;ll
thtand by the Thquire.&nbsp; More than that: thith ith a
prethiouth rathcal, and belongth to that bluthtering Cove that my
people nearly pitht out o&rsquo; winder.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be a
dark night; I&rsquo;ve got a horthe that&rsquo;ll do anything but
thpeak; I&rsquo;ve got a pony that&rsquo;ll go fifteen mile an
hour with Childerth driving of him; I&rsquo;ve got a dog
that&rsquo;ll keep a man to one plathe four-and-twenty
hourth.&nbsp; Get a word with the young Thquire.&nbsp; Tell him,
when he theeth our horthe begin to danthe, not to be afraid of
being thpilt, but to look out for a pony-gig coming up.&nbsp;
Tell him, when he theeth that gig clothe by, to jump down, and
it&rsquo;ll take him off at a rattling pathe.&nbsp; If my dog
leth thith young man thtir a peg on foot, I give him leave to
go.&nbsp; And if my horthe ever thtirth from that thpot where he
beginth a danthing, till the morning&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
him?&mdash;Tharp&rsquo;th the word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The word was so sharp, that in ten minutes Mr. Childers,
sauntering about the market-place in a pair of slippers, had his
cue, and Mr. Sleary&rsquo;s equipage was ready.&nbsp; It was a
fine sight, to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr.
Sleary instructing him, with his one practicable eye, that Bitzer
was the object of his particular attentions.&nbsp; Soon after
dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a
formidable creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and
sticking close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready
for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to
alight.</p>
<p>The other three sat up at the inn all night in great
suspense.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning Mr. Sleary
and the dog reappeared: both in high spirits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, Thquire!&rsquo; said Mr. Sleary, &lsquo;your
thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time.&nbsp; Childerth took him
off, an hour and a half after we left there latht night.&nbsp;
The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat (he would
have walthed if he hadn&rsquo;t been in harneth), and then I gave
him the word and he went to thleep comfortable.&nbsp; When that
prethiouth young Rathcal thed he&rsquo;d go for&rsquo;ard afoot,
the dog hung on to hith neck-hankercher with all four legth in
the air and pulled him down and rolled him over.&nbsp; Tho he
come back into the drag, and there he that, &rsquo;till I turned
the horthe&rsquo;th head, at half-patht thixth thith
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of course; and
hinted as delicately as he could, at a handsome remuneration in
money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want money mythelf, Thquire; but
Childerth ith a family man, and if you wath to like to offer him
a five-pound note, it mightn&rsquo;t be unactheptable.&nbsp;
Likewithe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog, or a thet
of bellth for the horthe, I thould be very glad to take
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Brandy and water I alwayth take.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
had already called for a glass, and now called for another.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t think it going too far, Thquire, to
make a little thpread for the company at about three and thixth
ahead, not reckoning Luth, it would make &rsquo;em
happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All these little tokens of his gratitude, Mr. Gradgrind very
willingly undertook to render.&nbsp; Though he thought them far
too slight, he said, for such a service.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Thquire; then, if you&rsquo;ll only give a
Horthe-riding, a bethpeak, whenever you can, you&rsquo;ll more
than balanthe the account.&nbsp; Now, Thquire, if your daughter
will ethcuthe me, I thould like one parting word with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary,
stirring and drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went
on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thquire,&mdash;you don&rsquo;t need to be told that
dogth ith wonderful animalth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Their instinct,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;is
surprising.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever you call it&mdash;and I&rsquo;m bletht if
<i>I</i> know what to call it&rsquo;&mdash;said Sleary, &lsquo;it
ith athtonithing.&nbsp; The way in whith a dog&rsquo;ll find
you&mdash;the dithtanthe he&rsquo;ll come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His scent,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind, &lsquo;being so
fine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m bletht if I know what to call it,&rsquo;
repeated Sleary, shaking his head, &lsquo;but I have had dogth
find me, Thquire, in a way that made me think whether that dog
hadn&rsquo;t gone to another dog, and thed, &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t happen to know a perthon of the name of Thleary, do
you?&nbsp; Perthon of the name of Thleary, in the Horthe-Riding
way&mdash;thtout man&mdash;game eye?&rdquo;&nbsp; And whether
that dog mightn&rsquo;t have thed, &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t
thay I know him mythelf, but I know a dog that I think would be
likely to be acquainted with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And whether that
dog mightn&rsquo;t have thought it over, and thed,
&ldquo;Thleary, Thleary!&nbsp; O yeth, to be thure!&nbsp; A
friend of mine menthioned him to me at one time.&nbsp; I can get
you hith addreth directly.&rdquo;&nbsp; In conthequenth of my
being afore the public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there
mutht be a number of dogth acquainted with me, Thquire, that
<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this
speculation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any way,&rsquo; said Sleary, after putting his lips to
his brandy and water, &lsquo;ith fourteen month ago, Thquire,
thinthe we wath at Chethter.&nbsp; We wath getting up our
Children in the Wood one morning, when there cometh into our
Ring, by the thtage door, a dog.&nbsp; He had travelled a long
way, he wath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty
well blind.&nbsp; He went round to our children, one after
another, as if he wath a theeking for a child he know&rsquo;d;
and then he come to me, and throwd hithelf up behind, and thtood
on hith two forelegth, weak ath he wath, and then he wagged hith
tail and died.&nbsp; Thquire, that dog wath
Merrylegth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sissy&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s dog!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thethilia&rsquo;th father&rsquo;th old dog.&nbsp; Now,
Thquire, I can take my oath, from my knowledge of that dog, that
that man wath dead&mdash;and buried&mdash;afore that dog come
back to me.&nbsp; Joth&rsquo;phine and Childerth and me talked it
over a long time, whether I thould write or not.&nbsp; But we
agreed, &ldquo;No.&nbsp; There&rsquo;th nothing comfortable to
tell; why unthettle her mind, and make her unhappy?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Tho, whether her father bathely detherted her; or whether he
broke hith own heart alone, rather than pull her down along with
him; never will be known, now, Thquire, till&mdash;no, not till
we know how the dogth findth uth out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She keeps the bottle that he sent her for, to this
hour; and she will believe in his affection to the last moment of
her life,&rsquo; said Mr. Gradgrind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It theemth to prethent two thingth to a perthon,
don&rsquo;t it, Thquire?&rsquo; said Mr. Sleary, musing as he
looked down into the depths of his brandy and water: &lsquo;one,
that there ith a love in the world, not all Thelf-interetht after
all, but thomething very different; t&rsquo;other, that it hath a
way of its own of calculating or not calculating, whith somehow
or another ith at leatht ath hard to give a name to, ath the
wayth of the dogth ith!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gradgrind looked out of window, and made no reply.&nbsp;
Mr. Sleary emptied his glass and recalled the ladies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thethilia my dear, kith me and good-bye!&nbsp; Mith
Thquire, to thee you treating of her like a thithter, and a
thithter that you trutht and honour with all your heart and more,
ith a very pretty thight to me.&nbsp; I hope your brother may
live to be better detherving of you, and a greater comfort to
you.&nbsp; Thquire, thake handth, firtht and latht!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be croth with uth poor vagabondth.&nbsp; People mutht
be amuthed.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t be alwayth a learning, nor yet
they can&rsquo;t be alwayth a working, they an&rsquo;t made for
it.&nbsp; You <i>mutht</i> have uth, Thquire.&nbsp; Do the withe
thing and the kind thing too, and make the betht of uth; not the
wurtht!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I never thought before,&rsquo; said Mr. Sleary,
putting his head in at the door again to say it, &lsquo;that I
wath tho muth of a Cackler!&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FINAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a dangerous thing to see
anything in the sphere of a vain blusterer, before the vain
blusterer sees it himself.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby felt that Mrs.
Sparsit had audaciously anticipated him, and presumed to be wiser
than he.&nbsp; Inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant
discovery of Mrs. Pegler, he turned this presumption, on the part
of a woman in her dependent position, over and over in his mind,
until it accumulated with turning like a great snowball.&nbsp; At
last he made the discovery that to discharge this highly
connected female&mdash;to have it in his power to say, &lsquo;She
was a woman of family, and wanted to stick to me, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t have it, and got rid of her&rsquo;&mdash;would be
to get the utmost possible amount of crowning glory out of the
connection, and at the same time to punish Mrs. Sparsit according
to her deserts.</p>
<p>Filled fuller than ever, with this great idea, Mr. Bounderby
came in to lunch, and sat himself down in the dining-room of
former days, where his portrait was.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit sat by
the fire, with her foot in her cotton stirrup, little thinking
whither she was posting.</p>
<p>Since the Pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered her pity
for Mr. Bounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and
contrition.&nbsp; In virtue thereof, it had become her habit to
assume a woful look, which woful look she now bestowed upon her
patron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said
Mr. Bounderby, in a very short, rough way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;do not
bite my nose off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bite your nose off, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; repeated Mr.
Bounderby.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Your</i> nose!&rsquo; meaning, as Mrs.
Sparsit conceived, that it was too developed a nose for the
purpose.&nbsp; After which offensive implication, he cut himself
a crust of bread, and threw the knife down with a noise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit took her foot out of her stirrup, and said,
&lsquo;Mr. Bounderby, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; retorted Mr. Bounderby.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What are you staring at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I ask, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sparsit, &lsquo;have
you been ruffled this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I inquire, sir,&rsquo; pursued the injured woman,
&lsquo;whether <i>I</i> am the unfortunate cause of your having
lost your temper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, &lsquo;I am not come here to be bullied.&nbsp; A
female may be highly connected, but she can&rsquo;t be permitted
to bother and badger a man in my position, and I am not going to
put up with it.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to
get on: foreseeing that if he allowed of details, he would be
beaten.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her Coriolanian
eyebrows; gathered up her work into its proper basket; and
rose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said she, majestically.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
apparent to me that I am in your way at present.&nbsp; I will
retire to my own apartment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Allow me to open the door, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir; I can do it for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better allow me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, passing her, and getting his hand upon the lock;
&lsquo;because I can take the opportunity of saying a word to
you, before you go.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparsit, ma&rsquo;am, I rather
think you are cramped here, do you know?&nbsp; It appears to me,
that, under my humble roof, there&rsquo;s hardly opening enough
for a lady of your genius in other people&rsquo;s
affairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sparsit gave him a look of the darkest scorn, and said
with great politeness, &lsquo;Really, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late
affairs have happened, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Bounderby;
&lsquo;and it appears to my poor judgment&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Pray, sir,&rsquo; Mrs. Sparsit interposed,
with sprightly cheerfulness, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t disparage your
judgment.&nbsp; Everybody knows how unerring Mr.
Bounderby&rsquo;s judgment is.&nbsp; Everybody has had proofs of
it.&nbsp; It must be the theme of general conversation.&nbsp;
Disparage anything in yourself but your judgment, sir,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Sparsit, laughing.</p>
<p>Mr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It appears to me, ma&rsquo;am, I say, that a different
sort of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of
<i>your</i> powers.&nbsp; Such an establishment as your relation,
Lady Scadgers&rsquo;s, now.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think you might
find some affairs there, ma&rsquo;am, to interfere
with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It never occurred to me before, sir,&rsquo; returned
Mrs. Sparsit; &lsquo;but now you mention it, should think it
highly probable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then suppose you try, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Bounderby, laying an envelope with a cheque in it in her little
basket.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can take your own time for going,
ma&rsquo;am; but perhaps in the meanwhile, it will be more
agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind, to eat her meals by
herself, and not to be intruded upon.&nbsp; I really ought to
apologise to you&mdash;being only Josiah Bounderby of
Coketown&mdash;for having stood in your light so long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t name it, sir,&rsquo; returned Mrs.
Sparsit.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that portrait could speak, sir&mdash;but
it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the
power of committing itself and disgusting others,&mdash;it would
testify, that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually
addressed it as the picture of a Noodle.&nbsp; Nothing that a
Noodle does, can awaken surprise or indignation; the proceedings
of a Noodle can only inspire contempt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her Roman features like a
medal struck to commemorate her scorn of Mr. Bounderby, surveyed
him fixedly from head to foot, swept disdainfully past him, and
ascended the staircase.&nbsp; Mr. Bounderby closed the door, and
stood before the fire; projecting himself after his old explosive
manner into his portrait&mdash;and into futurity.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Into how much of futurity?&nbsp; He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting
out a daily fight at the points of all the weapons in the female
armoury, with the grudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady
Scadgers, still laid up in bed with her mysterious leg, and
gobbling her insufficient income down by about the middle of
every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a mere closet
for one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more?&nbsp; Did he
catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to
strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his
master&rsquo;s great merits, who had won young Tom&rsquo;s place,
and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by
various rascals he was spirited away?&nbsp; Did he see any faint
reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby
five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each
taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown,
should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in
Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever
go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out
of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all healthy
stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and
bluster?&nbsp; Had he any prescience of the day, five years to
come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in
the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its
long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example,
little service and much law?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; Yet the
portrait was to see it all out.</p>
<p>Here was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour,
sitting thoughtful in his own room.&nbsp; How much of futurity
did <i>he</i> see?&nbsp; Did he see himself, a white-haired
decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible theories to
appointed circumstances; making his facts and figures subservient
to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and no longer trying to grind that
Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills?&nbsp; Did he catch sight
of himself, therefore much despised by his late political
associates?&nbsp; Did he see them, in the era of its being quite
settled that the national dustmen have only to do with one
another, and owe no duty to an abstraction called a People,
&lsquo;taunting the honourable gentleman&rsquo; with this and
with that and with what not, five nights a-week, until the small
hours of the morning?&nbsp; Probably he had that much
foreknowledge, knowing his men.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here was Louisa on the night of the same day, watching the
fire as in days of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler
face.&nbsp; How much of the future might arise before <i>her</i>
vision?&nbsp; Broadsides in the streets, signed with her
father&rsquo;s name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool,
weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his
own son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he
could not bring himself to add, his education) might beseech;
were of the Present.&nbsp; So, Stephen Blackpool&rsquo;s
tombstone, with her father&rsquo;s record of his death, was
almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be.&nbsp; These
things she could plainly see.&nbsp; But, how much of the
Future?</p>
<p>A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once
again appearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing
to and fro at the set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of
pensive beauty, always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and
serene, and even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place,
alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded, drunken wretch
of her own sex, who was sometimes seen in the town secretly
begging of her, and crying to her; a woman working, ever working,
but content to do it, and preferring to do it as her natural lot,
until she should be too old to labour any more?&nbsp; Did Louisa
see this?&nbsp; Such a thing was to be.</p>
<p>A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on
paper blotted with tears, that her words had too soon come true,
and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply bartered
for a sight of her dear face?&nbsp; At length this brother coming
nearer home, with hope of seeing her, and being delayed by
illness; and then a letter, in a strange hand, saying &lsquo;he
died in hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence and
love of you: his last word being your name&rsquo;?&nbsp; Did
Louisa see these things?&nbsp; Such things were to be.</p>
<p>Herself again a wife&mdash;a mother&mdash;lovingly watchful of
her children, ever careful that they should have a childhood of
the mind no less than a childhood of the body, as knowing it to
be even a more beautiful thing, and a possession, any hoarded
scrap of which, is a blessing and happiness to the wisest?&nbsp;
Did Louisa see this?&nbsp; Such a thing was never to be.</p>
<p>But, happy Sissy&rsquo;s happy children loving her; all
children loving her; she, grown learned in childish lore;
thinking no innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised; trying
hard to know her humbler fellow-creatures, and to beautify their
lives of machinery and reality with those imaginative graces and
delights, without which the heart of infancy will wither up, the
sturdiest physical manhood will be morally stark death, and the
plainest national prosperity figures can show, will be the
Writing on the Wall,&mdash;she holding this course as part of no
fantastic vow, or bond, or brotherhood, or sisterhood, or pledge,
or covenant, or fancy dress, or fancy fair; but simply as a duty
to be done,&mdash;did Louisa see these things of herself?&nbsp;
These things were to be.</p>
<p>Dear reader!&nbsp; It rests with you and me, whether, in our
two fields of action, similar things shall be or not.&nbsp; Let
them be!&nbsp; We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to
see the ashes of our fires turn gray and cold.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
