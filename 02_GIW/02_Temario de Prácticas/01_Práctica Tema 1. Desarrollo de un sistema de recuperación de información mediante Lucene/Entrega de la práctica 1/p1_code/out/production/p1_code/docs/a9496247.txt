Abstract    :
              The project will pursue new research directions in computational               
              geometry.  It will address numerical issues by 1) creating robust              
              algorithms that have provably reliable rounded arithmetic                      
              implementations and 2) developing techniques for reducing the amount           
              of precision required when exact arithmetic is used.  It will also             
              address applications in manufacturing, for example, by developing              
              algorithms for automated layout of patterns on cloth.
