<p>The film stars <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/a/Stanley_Baker_5299.html" title="Stanley Baker">Stanley Baker</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/c/Michael_Caine_6eb4.html" title="Michael Caine">Michael Caine</a> (in his first starring role), with a supporting cast that includes <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/c/Jack_Hawkins_93cb.html" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/u/l/l/Ulla_Jacobsson_2d92.html" title="Ulla Jacobsson">Ulla Jacobsson</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/m/James_Booth_a98c.html" title="James Booth">James Booth</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/i/g/Nigel_Green_5243.html" title="Nigel Green">Nigel Green</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/u/Paul_Daneman_54e3.html" title="Paul Daneman">Paul Daneman</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/g/l/y/Glynn_Edwards_5d18.html" title="Glynn Edwards">Glynn Edwards</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/t/Patrick_Magee_c666.html" title="Patrick Magee">Patrick Magee</a>. The opening and closing narration is spoken by <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Burton_49d2.html" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>.</p>
<p>The film was compared by Baker to a <a href="../../../../articles/w/e/s/Western_movie.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Western movie">Western movie</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_needed_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>, with the traditional roles of the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_Cavalry_9840.html" class="mw-redirect" title="United States Cavalry">United States Cavalry</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a> taken by the British and the Zulus respectively. The film acknowledges the Zulus' bravery. Baker showed a Western to Zulu extras to demonstrate the concept of film acting and how he wanted the warriors to conduct themselves.</p>
<p>Most of the characters in the film were based on actual participants of the battle, but their behaviour is mostly fictional—something that has provoked disapproval: in an interview on the DVD, the descendants of <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/f/Alfred_Henry_Hook_5803.html" title="Alfred Henry Hook">Private Hook</a> object to his negative portrayal in the film (he is depicted as a thief and malingerer, though his character acts bravely near the end of the movie during some desperate fighting). Indeed, Hook's elderly daughters walked out of the film's 1964 London premiere, angry at the way their father had been depicted.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, a <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/e/Prequel.html" title="Prequel">prequel</a>, <i><a href="../../../../articles/z/u/l/Zulu_Dawn_846b.html" title="Zulu Dawn">Zulu Dawn</a></i>, was released.</p>

The first scene shows a grassy landscape with many dead British soldiers, while victorious Zulus gather their weapons.</p>
<p>A mass Zulu marriage ceremony witnessed by <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missionary</a> <a href="../../../../articles/o/t/t/Otto_Witt_334e.html" title="Otto Witt">Otto Witt</a> (<a href="../../../../articles/j/a/c/Jack_Hawkins_93cb.html" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>), his daughter (<a href="../../../../articles/u/l/l/Ulla_Jacobsson_2d92.html" title="Ulla Jacobsson">Ulla Jacobsson</a>) and Zulu King <a href="../../../../articles/c/e/t/Cetshwayo.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Cetshwayo">Cetshwayo</a> (Chief <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/n/Mangosuthu_Buthelezi_7011.html" title="Mangosuthu Buthelezi">Mangosuthu Buthelezi</a>) is interrupted by a messenger who informs Cetshwayo of the great victory earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The movie then shifts to the missionary station of <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/r/Rorke%27s_Drift_9934.html" title="Rorke's Drift">Rorke's Drift</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/l/Colony_of_Natal_a36c.html" title="Colony of Natal">Natal</a>, being used by the British army as a supply dump and hospital for their now-defeated invasion force across the border in Zululand. The commanders of the depot, Lieutenants John Chard (<a href="../../../../articles/s/t/a/Stanley_Baker_5299.html" title="Stanley Baker">Stanley Baker</a>) and Gonville Bromhead (<a href="../../../../articles/m/i/c/Michael_Caine_6eb4.html" title="Michael Caine">Michael Caine</a>), receive news of Isandhlwana and that a large enemy force is advancing their way. Realizing that they cannot outrun the Zulu army, especially with wagonloads of wounded soldiers, the commanders decide to <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/r/Fortify.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fortify">fortify</a> the station, using wagons, sacks of <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/a/Mealie.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Mealie">mealie</a>, and crates of <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Hardtack.html" title="Hardtack">ship's biscuit</a>, and await the assault. As the Zulu <i><a href="../../../../articles/i/m/p/Impi.html" title="Impi">impis</a></i> approach, soldiers of the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/Natal_Native_Contingent_2bc2.html" title="Natal Native Contingent">Natal Native Contingent</a> and British settlers flee the site. Zulu <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/a/Sharpshooter.html" title="Sharpshooter">sharpshooters</a> open fire on the station from a neighbouring hill. Over the next few hours, the main Zulu body launches wave after wave of attacks, which are repulsed, though the attackers succeed in setting fire to the hospital, leading to intense fighting between British patients and Zulu warriors as the former try to escape the flames. Attacks continue into the night, finally forcing the British to withdraw into a tiny redoubt built from supply crates and mealie bags.</p>
<p>The next morning, at dawn, the Zulus withdraw several hundred yards and begin singing a war chant; the British respond by singing "<a href="../../../../articles/m/e/n/Men_of_Harlech_b3c6.html" title="Men of Harlech">Men of Harlech</a>". After a last failed assault, in which the defenders form into three ranks and pour volley after volley into the Zulus, they withdraw after sustaining heavy casualties and sing a song to honour the bravery of the British defenders, and leave. The film ends with a narration by <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Burton_49d2.html" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>, listing defenders who received the <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a>-- including Private Hook.

He initially clashes with Lt. Chard, but soon accepts Chard's leadership.

<p>The film contains a number of factual errors,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> including:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are several errors concerning the Swedish missionaries, the Witts. In the film, Witt is depicted as a middle aged widower, a pacifist and drunkard, who has an adult daughter called Margareta. In reality, Otto Witt was aged 30, and had a wife, Elin, and two infant children. Witt's family were at Oskarsberg 30 km away at the time of the battle. On the morning of the battle, Otto Witt, with the chaplain, George Smith and Surgeon-Major James Henry Reynolds had ascended Shiyane, the large hill near the station, and noticed the approach of the Zulu force across the Buffalo River. Far from being a pacifist, Witt had cooperated closely with the army and negotiated a lease to put Rorke's Drift at Lord Chelmsford's disposal. Witt made it clear that he did not oppose British intervention against Cetshwayo. He had stayed at Rorke's Drift because he wished "to take part in the defence of my own house and at the same time in the defence of an important place for the whole colony, yet my thoughts went to my wife and to my children, who were at a short distance from there, and did not know anything of what was going on". He therefore left on horseback to join his family shortly before the battle.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../articles/2/4/t/24th_Regiment_of_Foot_6e31.html" class="mw-redirect" title="24th Regiment of Foot">24th Regiment of Foot</a> is described as a Welsh regiment: in fact, although based in <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/e/Brecon.html" title="Brecon">Brecon</a> in south Wales, its designation was the <i>24th (The 2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot</i>. It did not become the <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/South_Wales_Borderers_e153.html" title="South Wales Borderers">South Wales Borderers</a> until <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>. Of the soldiers present, 49 were English, 32 Welsh (18 from the county of <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monmouthshire.html" title="Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</a> - not then classed as a "Welsh" county), 16 Irish and 22 others of indeterminate nationality.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></li>
<li>The song "Men of Harlech" features prominently as the regimental song; it did not become so until later. At the time of the battle, the regimental song was "The Warwickshire Lad". There was no "battlefield singing contest" between the British and the Zulus.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="../../../../articles/g/o/n/Gonville_Bromhead_8296.html" title="Gonville Bromhead">Gonville Bromhead</a> was partially deaf, a disability not mentioned in the film.</li>
<li>Many of the men, including Bromhead and <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Rouse_Merriott_Chard_6a42.html" class="mw-redirect" title="John Rouse Merriott Chard">Chard</a>, had full beards at the time of the battle. The film depicts them as largely clean shaven, with some sporting carefully-tended moustaches or sideburns.</li>
<li>The British infantrymen of the <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/g/Anglo-Zulu_War_347d.html" title="Anglo-Zulu War">Anglo-Zulu War</a> did not wear sparkling white <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/t/Pith_helmet.html" title="Pith helmet">pith helmets</a>. They were stained a tan colour (with tea or coffee) without helmet plates, and the bright scarlet uniforms were always covered in dust making them appear brown.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/n/Seniority.html" title="Seniority">seniority</a> of Chard over Bromhead (measured by their dates of commission) was three years, not three months as in the film. Also, there was no dispute over command. Lieutenant Chard was left in charge, due to seniority, by Major Henry Spalding well before the battle. Spalding rode off to get reinforcements, but his motives have been questioned.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></li>
<li>Private <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/f/Alfred_Henry_Hook_5803.html" title="Alfred Henry Hook">Henry Hook</a> VC is depicted as a rogue; in fact he was a model soldier who later became a sergeant; he was also a <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/e/Teetotaller.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Teetotaller">teetotaller</a>. While the film has him in the hospital "malingering, under arrest", he had actually been assigned there specifically to guard the building.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></li>
<li>Conversely, Corporal <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/William_Wilson_Allen_7bb7.html" title="William Wilson Allen">William Allen</a> is depicted as a model soldier; in fact, he had recently been demoted from sergeant for drunkenness.</li>
<li>Colour Sergeant Bourne (1854-1945) is depicted as a big, hardened, middle-aged veteran; in fact, he was of smaller stature and, aged 23, the youngest colour sergeant in the British Army.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> He was called 'The Kid' by his men.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> Sergeant Bourne would not have worn medals on his duty uniform, and the medals used in the film appear to be of World War I issue. Moreover, Green's costume has the chevrons on the wrong arm.</li>
<li>The role of <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/d/Padre_George_Smith_927d.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Padre George Smith">Padre George Smith</a> ["Ammunition" Smith] is completely ignored.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></li>
<li>The building of defensive ramparts and initial defence of Rorke's Drift was organised by Acting Assistant Commissary <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/m/James_Langley_Dalton_ac8d.html" title="James Langley Dalton">James Langley Dalton</a>. His distinction was rewarded with the Victoria Cross, presented a year after the battle. The film gives most of the credit to Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead. The real Dalton had retired in 1871 as a <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/a/Quartermaster.html" title="Quartermaster">Quartermaster Sergeant</a> after 22 years of service in the 85th Regiment of Foot of the <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> before volunteering for the <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Commissariat_and_Transport_Department_32eb.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Commissariat and Transport Department">Commissariat and Transport Department</a>. The film, however, portrays Dalton as something of an effete character, who does little that might be called heroic. This makes his award seem something of a mystery.</li>
<li>The column of British irregular <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> seen briefly in the film was actually at Rorke's Drift. However, Chard ordered them to leave after finding that they had little ammunition of their own.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></li>
<li>The uniforms of the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/Natal_Native_Contingent_2bc2.html" title="Natal Native Contingent">Natal Native Contingent</a> are inaccurate;</li>
<li>NNC troops were not issued with European-style clothes.</li>
<li>The real Sergeant Maxfield, as in the film, was delirious with fever. However, he was too weak to leave his bed and was stabbed to death by Zulus while the other sick and injured were being evacuated from the room.</li>
<li>Private Cole was assigned to defend the hospital, not the perimeter.</li>
<li>Cole was killed when he ran out of the hospital alone, possibly due to <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/a/Claustrophobia.html" title="Claustrophobia">claustrophobia</a>. Since he was killed by a bullet to the head, his <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/s/Last_words.html" title="Last words">last words</a> in the film are unlikely to be authentic.</li>
<li>Corporal <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christian_Ferdinand_Schiess_7340.html" title="Christian Ferdinand Schiess">Christian Ferdinand Schiess</a> was significantly younger than the actor who portrayed him. At the time of his death in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a> – five years after the battle – he was 28 years old.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="../../../../articles/f/r/e/Frederick_Hitch_7c48.html" title="Frederick Hitch">Private Hitch</a> was shot through the shoulder, not the leg.</li>
<li>None of the <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifles</a> used by the <a href="../../../../articles/z/u/l/Zulus.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Zulus">Zulus</a> were taken from dead British soldiers after the <a href="../../../../articles/b/a/t/Battle_of_Isandlwana_5822.html" title="Battle of Isandlwana">Battle of Isandlwana</a>, as NNC Lieutenant Adendorff in the film suggests. The Zulus attacking Rorke's Drift were largely older and married regiments. Their assignment at Isandlwana had been to cut off retreat and they had not been on the battlefield itself. Most of their firearms were obsolete <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/o/Brown_Bess_9d43.html" title="Brown Bess">Brown Bess</a> <a href="../../../../articles/m/u/s/Musket.html" title="Musket">muskets</a>, purchased decades earlier from traders, including James Rorke.</li>
<li>The ending is somewhat fictitious. There was no Zulu attack at dawn on <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/n/January_23.html" title="January 23">January 23</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>, which in the film led to the singing of "Men of Harlech". There was only sparse fighting with a few remaining Zulus. The Zulus did not sing a song saluting fellow warriors, and they did not depart peacefully. They departed at the approach of a British relief column.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></li>
<li>The story of the black <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/t/Natal_Native_Contingent_2bc2.html" title="Natal Native Contingent">Natal Native Contingent</a> troops' desertion is true. However, as Witt had already left, he was not responsible for their departure. They left of their own will, with Stephenson and his European NCOs.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> These deserters were shot at and one of the NCOs, Corporal Anderson, was killed. Stephenson was later convicted of <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/s/Desertion.html" title="Desertion">desertion</a> at <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/u/Court-martial.html" title="Court-martial">court-martial</a> and dismissed from the army.</li>
<li>The film omits the killing of wounded Zulus by British soldiers after the battle. There has been speculation that many may have been bayonetted, clubbed or shot in the battle's aftermath. (This was common practice if a small force prevailed over a much larger one, as it would have been unable to guard all the prisoners.)</li>
<li>The officers are shown using <a href="../../../../articles/w/e/b/Webley_revolver.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Webley revolver">Webley Mk VI</a> .455 revolvers which were not introduced until <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> (36 years after the events depicted in the film) instead of the <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/b/Robert_Adams_of_London_9b73.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Robert Adams of London">Beaumont-Adams</a> revolvers that Bromhead and Chard actually used. However, the British officer of the time was allowed to use any sort of sidearm he wished, as long as it fired .455 ammunition. Officers often privately purchased Webley top-break revolvers (in 1879 not yet officially adopted for service) somewhat similar in appearance to the Mk VI Webley. These <a href="http://www.earmi.it/armi/atlas/74.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.earmi.it/armi/atlas/74.htm" rel="nofollow">Webley models</a> had been put on the market during the 1870s - such as the Webley-Green army model 1879 or the Webley-Pryse model. So the Webley model Mk VI was not yet developed when the film was set, but the design is typical of Webley revolvers of the period and can be seen as an example of artistic licence.</li>
<li>Several men can be seen using <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/e/Lee-Enfield_272c.html" title="Lee-Enfield">Lee-Enfield</a> Mk. I bolt-action rifles instead of the historically correct <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Martini-Henry_3cce.html" title="Martini-Henry">Martini-Henry</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> Apparently, they ran out of .450/577 blanks during filming - close observation shows that, in many cases, the actors are simply dry-shooting the empty Martini-Henrys and simulating the recoil, with the gunshot sound effect dubbed in later.</li>
<li>Surgeon-Major Reynolds is played by Patrick Magee as a middle-aged South African. In actuality Reynolds was a thirty-five year old Irishman. During the Battle of Rorke's Drift, Reynolds went round the barricades, distributing ammunition and tending to wounded there, something that is not shown in the film.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></li>
<li>Whenever a Zulu falls to the bullets from Martini-Henry rifles in the film, they drop dead with small wounds visible and with only little trickles of blood (as when 612 Williams shoots a Zulu in the hospital who is in the act of stabbing Private Hook). But wounds inflicted from the heavy .45 ins lead bullets would create massive gaping holes and much tissue damage. Presumably, the film-makers would not wish to show this to an audience at the time.</li>
<li>The attack on the mission station was not ordered by King Cetshwayo, as the audience is led to believe in the film. Cetshwayo had specifically told his warriors not to invade Natal, the British Colony. The attack was led by Prince Dabulamanzi kaMpande, the King's half-brother, who pursued fleeing survivors at Isandlwana across the river and then moved on to attack Rorke's Drift.</li>
<li>During the period when the mission station is fortified, the wagons used in the barricades are seen to be tipped over onto their sides. In reality, they remained upright, and the gaps between were plugged with biscuit boxes and mealie bags (Chard had placed them this way so that the Zulus would have to climb over the wagons to engage the British soldiers standing behind them, thus giving the defenders more time to shoot).</li>
<li>Captain Stephenson, and his detachment of cavalry, claim to have come from "Durnford's Horse" when they ride up to the mission station. In reality, they were members of the Natal Native Horse, mainly composed of black riders, who had survived the Battle of Isandlwana and had ridden to Rorke's Drift to warn and aid the garrison there.</li>
<li>All the characters in the film pronounce Bromhead's name as it is spelt. In reality it was pronounced 'Brumhead'.</li>
<li>Both Chard and Bromhead are portrayed as being intelligent and able officers. In reality, Chard was widely regarded as inefficient if not actually incompetent, and had a reputation for laziness.{see 'Zulu' by Saul David pp230} Bromhead was a popular officer within the 24th, acquiring the nickname 'Gunny,' however he never seems to have been trusted with any meaningful responsibilities. It was for this reason that his company was selected to guard Rorke's Drift, a position it was never imagined would be attacked.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since May 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_needed_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Much of the credit for the defence of the mission station must in fact go to Dunne and Dalton of the commissariat department.</li>
