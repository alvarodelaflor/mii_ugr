Abstract    :
                   Importance sampling is a general Monte Carlo method that in               
              principle allows the simulation designer to utilize specific                   
              knowledge of the systems operation in order to reduce the                      
              computational burden of a particular simulation run. Computational             
              efficiencies of three to five orders of magnitude might be                     
              possible. The application area being studied in this project is the            
              digital satellite communication channel, characterized by noise,               
              intersymbol interference, and system nonlinearity. Trellis-coded               
              modulation and Viterbi decoding are initially employed as the                  
              signalling format.
