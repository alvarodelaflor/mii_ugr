Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support to a group from the                       
              University of Michigan to continue a research program in high                  
              energy physics.  The group is participating in a experiment                    
              (UA6) at the Super Proton Synchrotron (CERN) during proton -                   
              antiproton collider operation.  The experiment uses an                         
              internal hydrogen gas target and studies high momentum                         
              transfer single particle production, focussing on photons,                     
              production of e+e-pairs, and low momentum transfer elastic                     
              scattering in both proton-proton and antiproton-proton                         
              interactions.  The ability to compare direct photons from                      
              proton-proton and proton-antiproton interactions with the same                 
              apparatus yields a measurement of the gluon momentum                           
              distribution in protons and the scale parameter lambda used in                 
              the theory of quantum chromodynamics.
