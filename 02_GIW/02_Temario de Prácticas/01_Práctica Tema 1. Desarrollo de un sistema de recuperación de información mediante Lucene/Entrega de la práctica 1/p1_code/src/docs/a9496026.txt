Abstract    :
              Optical spectroscopy of actinide ions in glasses reveals variations            
              in the valences of these ions from the usual value of +3.  This                
              phenomena, recently observed for americium, will be investigated in            
              other actinides such as curium, neptunium, plutonium, and uranium.             
              Different glass hosts and reducing agents will be used to control              
              the valence state of the actinides.  Absorption and fluorescence               
              measurements of the ions over a range of temperatures and                      
              concentrations will be carried out.  Line narrowing and spectral               
              holes burning studies will provide information on energy transfer              
              and relaxation processes in these materials.  These processes are              
              very important in the development of lasers and other luminescent              
              devices and can reveal the dynamic and static structure of                     
              amorphous hosts.
