Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to investigate large-scale                   
              "buffer-focusing" chromatgraphy in which a precisely                           
              controlled, internal pH gradient traveling much more slowly                    
              than the fluid velocity is used to simultaneously concentrate                  
              and purify dilute mixtures of biomolecules.  The internal pH                   
              gradient is characterized by a low salt concentration, a high                  
              buffer capacity, and is produced using multicomponent mixtures                 
              of common amphoteric and non-amphoteric buffer compounds of                    
              defined chemical composition.  Each of the buffer compounds                    
              interacts with the column by adsorption or through acid-base                   
              reactions.  Reliable methods for producing internal pH                         
              gradients (e.g., criteria for selecting buffer compounds, type                 
              of sorbent, starting and final pH, column dimensions, and                      
              particle size) are to be developed using numerical simulations                 
              and ancillary experiments.  The use of buffer-focusing                         
              chromatography to separate model mixtures of proteins is also                  
              to be investigated theoretically and experimentally.                           
                                                                                             
              The results from this work can be used to evaluate buffer-                     
              focusing chromatography as an efficient, gently (i.e. non-                     
              denaturing) alternative to conventional large-scale methods                    
              for concentrating and purifying dilute mixtures of                             
              biomolecules.
