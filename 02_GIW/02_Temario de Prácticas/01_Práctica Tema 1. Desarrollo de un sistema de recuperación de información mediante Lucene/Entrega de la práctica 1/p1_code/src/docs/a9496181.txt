Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project                                             
              is to develop a procedure to                                                   
              balance the structure's actual                                                 
              strength and the required ductility                                            
              requirements for steel frame                                                   
              design.  Steel moment frames are                                               
              popularly used for low-to medium-                                              
              rise buildings in all seismic                                                  
              zones.  Unlike reinforced concrete                                             
              frames, member sizes of steel                                                  
              moment frames are quite often                                                  
              governed by drift limits; therefore                                            
              the structure's actual strength may                                            
              be significantly higher than that                                              
              required by seismic codes.                                                     
              Unfortunately, this unique feature                                             
              of steel design is not recognized                                              
              by seismic codes, and stringent                                                
              ductility requirements as specified                                            
              in these codes may be too                                                      
              conservative.  Furthermore, since                                              
              the stringent ductility                                                        
              requirements are developed                                                     
              primarily for high seismic zones,                                              
              its application to moderate or low                                             
              seismic zones has been questioned.                                             
                                                                                             
              The proposed design procedure                                                  
              considers explicitly the beneficial                                            
              structural overstrength resulting                                              
              from drift limitations; the                                                    
              required ductility is balanced by                                              
              this overstrength.  In addition to                                             
              two ductility classes (Special and                                             
              Ordinary Moment Frames) which have                                             
              been adopted in seismic provisions,                                            
              a third class (Intermediate Moment                                             
              Frame) will be developed in the                                                
              project.  Thus an economic design                                              
              which provides a more consistent                                               
              safely level for all seismic                                                   
              regions can be achieved.                                                       
                                                                                             
              An efficient computer program will                                             
              be developed to compute structural                                             
              overstrength.  Several moment

              zones will be designed by both the                                             
              conventional and proposed design                                               
              methods.  Feasibility study will be                                            
              conducted and cost savings                                                     
              resulting from the proposed design                                             
              method will be noted.  Safety level

              both methods will also be compared                                             
              by performing nonlinear dynamic
