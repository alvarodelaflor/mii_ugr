Abstract    :
              9350181  Haddad  The objective is to develop advanced integrated control design 
              methodology that captures as many design constraints as possible  within a
              unified framework.  Such as approach will provide the  capability for
              simultaneously performing multiple design  tradeoffs for multivariable systems
              with respect to competing  constraints, such as sensor noise, control effort,
              controller  order, robustness, disturbance attenuation, mean-square error, 
              sample rate, and controller structure.  Considerable attention  will be devoted
              to the multiobjective H2/H-inf synthesis problem  with the aim of designing
              minimal complexity controllers.  This  approach will lead to the design of
              industry standard controllers  that will fully encompass classical design
              objectives within  multivariable control theory.  ***
