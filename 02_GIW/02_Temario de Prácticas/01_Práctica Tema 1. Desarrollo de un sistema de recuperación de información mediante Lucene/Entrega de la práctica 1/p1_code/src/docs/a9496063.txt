Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by Professor Kinoshita at Harvard University.                 
              She will continue to search for elementary particles with                      
              exotic charge.  Etchable solid state track detectors are used                  
              to search for Dirac monopoles and other highly ionizing                        
              particles at two colliding beam accelerators.  The continued                   
              failure to observe magnetic monopoles remains a puzzle which                   
              impacts the fundamental premises of modern physics.
