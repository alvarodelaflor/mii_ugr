Abstract    :
              9308009   Erneux       The investigator studies a series of mathematical
              problems  connected with singular perturbation and bifurcation problems.  These
              problems are motivated by specific applications in science  and engineering.
              The principal applications appear in the area of  laser instabilities and in
              mathematical biology. The laser  problems concentrate on oscillatory responses
              typical to class B  lasers. The project develops new asymptotic methods to
              describe  time-periodic solutions and their bifurcations. The biological 
              problems concentrate on (1) the bursting oscillations observed in  chemical and
              biochemical systems and (2) the conditions for  propagation failure in a system
              of weakly coupled cells.       Many lasers are unstable devices that exhibit a
              pulsating  response.  These lasers include practical lasers such as 
              semiconductor or solid state lasers. In order to control these  instabilities,
              the investigator analyzes mathematically specific  laser models. Propagation
              failure (voltage or conduction block)  is a known problem in nerve conduction
              that has important medical  consequences. Most studies on the mechanisms
              leading to failure  have been numerical simulations. The investigator analyzes
              these  models in detail to obtain simple conditions for failure.  ***
