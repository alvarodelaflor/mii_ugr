Abstract    :
                      9309623  Lakmazaheri  Engineering problems are modeled using linear and
              non-linear  constraints.  Automated reasoning about engineering problems, thus,
               requires reasoning about linear and non-linear constraints.   Effective
              strategies for reasoning about linear constraints exist.   The use of these
              strategies for engineering applications has been  investigated by several
              researchers.  However, automated reasoning  about engineering problems which
              involve non-linear constrains has  not yet been explored.  This is mainly due
              to the lack of effective  strategies for reasoning about non-linear
              constraints.  Recently,  Wu developed an effective approach for reasoning about
              non-linear  constraints.  The proposed investigation explore the use of Wu's 
              method for reasoning about structural design problems in ways which  have not
              been possible before.
