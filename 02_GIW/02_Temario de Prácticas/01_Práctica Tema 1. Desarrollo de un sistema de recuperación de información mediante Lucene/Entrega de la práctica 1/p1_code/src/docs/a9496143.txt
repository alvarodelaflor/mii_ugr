Abstract    :
              The studies proposed will examine the mechanism of translation                 
              repression of bacteriophage T4 genes by the T4 regA protein.  To               
              better understand how regA protein recognizes and represses                    
              translation of specific T4 mRNAs the PI will attempt to identify               
              the targets recognized by regA protein on three T4 mRNAs.  From                
              these studies she will propose a model recognition element,                    
              incorporating the necessary characteristics of each of the three               
              sites. The PI will then test the validity of the model by a)                   
              inserting the proposed recognition element into a non-regA target              
              gene, and testing for regA sensitivity and b) measuring the effects            
              of mutations in the gene 44 recognition element on synthesis of 44P            
              in vivo and in vitro.                                                          
                                                                                             
              To identify residues or domains of regA protein that are critical              
              for RNA binding partial proteolysis in vitro mutagenesis of regA               
              protein will be employed.                                                      
                                                                                             
              These studies are designed to provide new insights into protein:               
              RNA interactions that play critical roles in the control of gene               
              expression.  A full understanding of the mechanism of translational            
              regulation of gene expression will help to answer larger questions             
              concerning infection and replication of viruses and control of cell            
              growth and differentiation.
