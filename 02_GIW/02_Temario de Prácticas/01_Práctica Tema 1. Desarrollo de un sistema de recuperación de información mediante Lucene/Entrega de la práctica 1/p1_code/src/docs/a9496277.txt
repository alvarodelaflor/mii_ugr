Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three year continuing grant.  As                   
              computing moves in the direction of small portable devices,                    
              speech and pen will become input modalities of choice.  This                   
              research addresses a critical issue of the identification of the               
              structural, linguistic and performance characteristics of                      
              handwriting and speech and issues of their interaction when used               
              together in an application.  A series of subject-placed                        
              experiments will assess writing and speech when they are:  (1)                 
              channeled by different types of system prompts, (2) resolving                  
              typical system recognition errors, and (3) experiencing system                 
              response delays deferring in magnitude and predictability.  This               
              research will provide a more complete understanding of how people              
              will write and speak to future interactive systems and how this                
              can be altered by fundamental parameters of system interactivity.              
              It will also provide a more principled basis for the design of                 
              complex multimodal systems.//
