Abstract    :
                   The study consists of an analysis of patterns of                          
              distribution, diversity and endemism in the terrestrial                        
              vertebrate fauna (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) of                 
              humid montane forests in the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico.               
              Two years will be spent exploring the four mountain ranges in the              
              state that are least well known faunistically: the Sierra de                   
              Miahuatlan, Sierra de Yucuyacua, Sierra de Huautla, and various                
              mountains in the Chimalapas region.  Information from other                    
              recent explorations, as well as historical records, will be added              
              in a geographic information system (GIS) data base.  The GIS will              
              allow analysis of the faunistic data in relation to physical                   
              geographic features, economic characteristics, and political                   
              limits.  This study is a collaborative effort between the Field                
              Museum of Natural History and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma                
              de Mexico, and will result in the training of seven young Mexican              
              biologists in techniques for biological inventories, data                      
              management, specimen curation, and analysis of conservation                    
              priorities.
