Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This four year program will enrich the mathematical content and                
              pedagogical knowledge of a group of 24 elementary teachers in                  
              Missouri. The project includes elements of teacher enhancement,                
              curriculum development, teachers as researchers, and research on               
              teacher development. Over the course of the project teachers will              
              collaborate closely amongst themselves, and with experts in                    
              mathematics education, to design, test, refine, and disseminate                
              instructional materials in the areas of geometry, problem solving,             
              estimation, measurement, and statistics. Pedagogical emphasis will be          
              on the use of small groups and activity-based approaches. Enhancement          
              activities will occur both at the University of Missouri, and in               
              site-based meetings of the staff with the teacher participants.                
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing from schools, the university, and individual                      
              contributions amounts to 20% of the NSF award.
