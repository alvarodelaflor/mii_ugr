Abstract    :
              This NYI award will fund both theoretical and experimental                     
              research on the evaluation of photon migration imaging as a                    
              biomedical optical imaging and spectroscopic tool.                             
              Investigations will focus upon correlating measured photon                     
              transport characteristics with the diffusion approximation which               
              describes light propagation in tissues and other random media.                 
                                                                                             
              This NYI award will also allow the investigator to continue                    
              teaching at both the undergraduate and the graduate levels in the              
              chemical engineering department and to revise the level of                     
              instruction of an undergraduate course.
