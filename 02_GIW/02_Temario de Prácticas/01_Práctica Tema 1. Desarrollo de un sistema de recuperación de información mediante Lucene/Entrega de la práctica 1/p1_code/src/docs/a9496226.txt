Abstract    :
              9312037   Wetherbee       Fond du Lac Community College (FDLCC) requests support
              from  NSF for connection of its campus network to NSFNET.  They will  contract
              with MRNet for delivery of Internet services.  These  services would support
              joint projects on the FDLCC campus and on  the Fond du Lac Reservation funded
              by the Department of Energy,  the National Science Foundation, and the
              Environmental Protection  Agency specifically designed to support young Native
              Americans in  pursuing scientific careers.       FDLCC would be the first
              Minnesota Community College System  campus to join MRNEt and one of the first
              American Indian Higher  Education Consortium (AIHEC) members to offer Internet
              services  on campus.  FDLCC would be in a good position to provide  leadership
              and technical assistance, especially in utilizing  Internet services,other
              AIHEC institutions.       The College needs greater functionality and network
              speed to  be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers
              along with being able to implement a more reliable mail  system. Students and
              faculty research will benefit from the link.   This is also a unique
              opportunity for the school to explore  innovative educational resources.  ***
