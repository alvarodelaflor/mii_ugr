Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                  
              support travel expenses for 13 US                                              
              mathematicians to meet with Latin American                                     
              counterparts and participate in a workshop on                                  
              dynamical systems, to be held in Rio de                                        
              Janeiro, Brazil, August 2-15, 1993.  The US                                    
              organizer is Sheldon Newhouse of the University                                
              of North Carolina and the Brazilian organizer                                  
              is Jacob Palis of the Institute of Pure and                                    
              Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro,                                  
              Brazil.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The project will enable this group of top                                      
              American mathematicians to interact, discuss                                   
              research problems, and develop collaborative                                   
              research proposals with peers as well as with                                  
              promising young mathematicians from Brazil,                                    
              Chile, Venezuela, Mexico, Uruguay, and                                         
              Argentina.  The host site will be IMPA, an                                     
              international center of excellence.  All sides                                 
              are likely to benefit from the exchange of                                     
              cutting-edge information, the establishment of                                 
              future collaborative ties, and the                                             
              strengthening of the human resource base in                                    
              Latin America.
