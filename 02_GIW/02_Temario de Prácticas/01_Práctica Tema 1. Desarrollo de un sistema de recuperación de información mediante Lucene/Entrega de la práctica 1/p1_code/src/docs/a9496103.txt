Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor A. Bertram to              
              work in algebraic geometry.  He will study the moduli spaces of                
              vector bundles on an algebraic curve. In particular he hopes to                
              derive a rigorous proof of the empirically observed formula of                 
              Verlinde and Witten for studying the cohomology groups associated              
              to these moduli spaces.                                                        
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures                  
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,              
              but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is                      
              extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself               
              useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer                   
              science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
