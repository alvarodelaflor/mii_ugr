Abstract    :
              9414332  Chen       This research investigates an approach that will enable 
              advances in design and control technologies for advanced  manufacturing
              systems.  The purpose of this research is twofold:  (1) to design and develop a
              neural network based decision support  system for use in design and
              configuration of advanced  manufacturing cells and cell control systems, and
              (2) to explore an  intelligent shop floor control framework for on-line
              scheduling and  control of Flexible Manufacturing Systems.         This
              innovative new design and operation methodology will be  illustrated through an
              implementation exercise, at laboratory  settings, in controlling a cluster of
              computer workstation which  simulates the stochastic operating characteristics
              of shop-floor  manufacturing machinery/equipment.  The intelligent shop floor 
              control scheme constitutes an integrated environment with  innovative cell
              control techniques which will not only assure that  feasible control actions be
              taken but also that the continuously  improved control decisions be implemented
              as cell operation time  goes by.
