Abstract    :
                   This research planning grant supports the work of Dr.                     
              Natarajan to work in the representation theory of direct limits of             
              the classical groups. In particular those that correspond to finite            
              dimensional classical domains over complex vector spaces.                      
                   As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries                 
              inherent in a system, the representation theory of the classical               
              groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself,                      
              particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical               
              physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle                  
              physics.
