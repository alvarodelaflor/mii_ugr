Abstract    :
                   Several intriguing hypotheses have been proposed regarding                
              large-scale temporal patterns of morphological diversity in the                
              history of clades, particularly those originating in the early                 
              Paleozoic.  However, the testing of evolutionary hypotheses                    
              regarding diversity has either used taxonomic diversity as a                   
              proxy for morphological diversity, or focused on patterns at                   
              relatively small scales.  The proposed research will investigate               
              temporal patterns of morphological diversity in large clades of                
              Paleozoic echinoderms, Class Crinoidea, as well as in smaller                  
              clades.  Specifically, it will be determined whether                           
              morphological diversity is concentrated early in the history of a              
              clade, and whether there are temporally directed differences                   
              between morphological and taxonomic diversity.  Morphological                  
              diversity will be measured directly, using dissimilarity measures              
              based on discrete-character data.  These data will be collected                
              from published species descriptions as well as museum specimens.               
              The approach adopted for quantifying morphology will allow direct              
              documentation of morphological diversity patterns at a broader                 
              taxonomic scale than has heretofore been practiced, and will                   
              therefore provide important new data relevant to major questions               
              of interest in evolutionary biology.
