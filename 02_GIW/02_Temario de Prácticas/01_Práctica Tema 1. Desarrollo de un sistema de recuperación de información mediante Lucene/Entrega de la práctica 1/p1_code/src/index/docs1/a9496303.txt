Abstract    :
              This project has two objectives.  One is to develop a theoretical              
              understanding of a generic environmental problem of which global               
              warming and acid deposition are two examples.  That problem is                 
              the optimal tradeoff between acting to control environmental                   
              externalities versus delaying control when faced with uncertainty              
              coupled with learning.  The second objective is to apply one or                
              more of these theoretical models to the global warming problem,                
              addressing the policy question of the extent to which the U.S.                 
              and other countries should control greenhouse gas emissions now                
              versus waiting until more is known about the problem before                    
              controlling.  This is one of the key issues in the public policy               
              debate on global warming and, thus, results of this project may                
              be very significant.  The two driving features of the models                   
              developed will be learning that occurs over time reducing                      
              uncertainty and the stock feature of externalities such as global              
              warming, whereby the stock causes damage but only the flow can be              
              controlled.  The approach of the theoretical part of the project               
              is to develop a stochastic optimal control problem and to                      
              investigate the comparative static properties of the resulting                 
              model.  The empirical portion of the project will numerically                  
              implement one of the theoretical models to the extent necessary                
              to develop policy conclusions.  This will involve adapting an                  
              empirical model developed elsewhere, perhaps the Nordhaus model,               
              rather than developing a totally new one.
