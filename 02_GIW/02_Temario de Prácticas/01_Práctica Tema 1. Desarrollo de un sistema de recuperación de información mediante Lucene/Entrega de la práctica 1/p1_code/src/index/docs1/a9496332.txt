Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Calcium plays important physiological roles in living organisms.  It is        
              a major component of biominerals.  Extracellular levels are involved in        
              excitation secretion coupling and intracellular levels have recently           
              been implicated as messengers in coordinating cellular responses.  This        
              proposal intends to use the molting cycle of the freshwater crayfish as        
              a model system in which to study mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation.                
              Crustaceans are ideal for this since they alternately undergo Ca2+             
              uptake (skeletal deposition) and Ca2+ output (skeletal resorption).            
              The associated mechanisms are highly refined in freshwater (ion                
              limited) species.  The study will be completed at 7 experimental levels        
              which are (1) whole animal Ca2+ (and associated electrolyte--Na+, Cl-,         
              HCO-3, H+) and water distribution among body tissues; (2) branchial            
              fluxes; (3) renal postfiltrational processing; (4) the electrochemical         
              basis of extracellular regulation; (5) skeletal and soft tissue                
              regulation; (6) epithelial transport modeled on an isolated cuticular          
              hypodermis and (7) subcellular distribution of transport enzymes Ca2+          
              and Na+/K+ ATPases and carbonic anhydrase.  Each of these parameters           
              will be studied in crayfish undergoing natural molts in artificial tap         
              water (controls) at 21 C.  Completion of the project should                    
              significantly advance our general understanding of the mechanisms and          
              control of bidirectional epithelial Ca2+ transport with specific               
              reference to crustacean molting.
