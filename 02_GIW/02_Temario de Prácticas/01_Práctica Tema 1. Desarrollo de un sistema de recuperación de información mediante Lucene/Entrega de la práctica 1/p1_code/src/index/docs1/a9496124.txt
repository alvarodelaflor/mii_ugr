Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor Y. Ye to work              
              in algebraic geometry.  He will work on the ample bundles on Fano              
              manifolds, extremal rays on projective manifolds, rationality of               
              a minimal degree curve and propagations of linear systems on                   
              curves on algebraic surfaces.                                                  
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved                   
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
