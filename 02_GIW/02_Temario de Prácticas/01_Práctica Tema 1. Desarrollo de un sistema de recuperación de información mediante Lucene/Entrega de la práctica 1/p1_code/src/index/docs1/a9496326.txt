Abstract    :
              This project is intended to provide vastly improved                            
              chronology, using 40Ar/39Ar methods for the age and duration                   
              of four Mesozoic flood basalt provinces of South America.                      
              The anticipated applications of the data to be acquired                        
              include:  1) Precise and accurate dating of the inception                      
              and duration of volcanism in each case to constrain models                     
              of flood basalt genesis, and the relations to continental                      
              rifting and hotspots;  2) To test for possible correlations                    
              with mass extinctions, particularly in the case of the                         
              Parana which may be related to the Jurassic-Cretaceous                         
              extinction event;  3) Precise and accurate temporal                            
              calibration of a Mesozoic Apparent Polar Wander Path for the                   
              South American continent to facilitate tectonic studies and                    
              comparison of South America's motion with position of the                      
              Tristan da Cunha hotspot;  4) Calibration of the Geomagnetic                   
              Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) in a time region badly needing                      
              improvement.  This two-year project will involve joint                         
              fieldwork and publication with Brazilian collaborators at                      
              the University of Sao Paulo; additional collaborators are                      
              Dr. Mark Richards (Univ. California, Berkeley) and Dr.                         
              Robert Coe (Univ. California, Santa Cruz).
