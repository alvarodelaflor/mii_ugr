Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research, supported by the National Science Foundation               
              Young Investigator award, will continue Xia's work on dynamical                
              systems and Hamiltonian mechanics.  In particular, he will work                
              on the singularities, Arnold diffusion and other chaotic                       
              solutions of the n-body problem.  He will also work on the                     
              generic properties of general Hamiltonian systems.                             
                   The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award                  
              recognizes outstanding young faculty.  This award recognizes the               
              recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as              
              a research mathematician and for significant development as a                  
              teacher and academic leader.
