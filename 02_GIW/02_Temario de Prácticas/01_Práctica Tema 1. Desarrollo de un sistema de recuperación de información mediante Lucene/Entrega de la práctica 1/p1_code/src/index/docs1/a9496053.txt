Abstract    :
              9307038  Philbrick       Underwater pollination (hydrophily) is one of the most 
              enigmatic pollination systems in flowering plants.  Hydrophily  requires the
              abandonment or modification of a suite of characters  intimately tied to the
              dry, aerial flowering condition, and  represents a shift in floral biology with
              profound consequences for  flower and pollen morphology.  The mechanical and
              biochemical  modifications entailed in achieving wettability (underwater
              release  and capture of pollen) raise significant adaptive obstacles not 
              encountered during evolutionary shifts from one aerial pollination  system to
              another.  The goals of Dr. Philbrick's project are to  probe questions
              concerning the evolution of water pollination using  the genus Callitriche as
              an experimental system.  Callitriche is  the most appropriate group to conduct
              these studies because it is  the only genus of angiosperms that includes both
              aerial and  underwater pollination systems.  Phylogenetic analysis using 
              morphological and new DNA characters will provide an understanding  of the
              direction of change in floral and pollen features across the  species in the
              genus, and thereby help determine models of change  in adaptation to underwater
              pollination.  %%%       Underwater pollination is one of the more bizarre
              adaptations  found in certain groups of flowering plants.  Dr. Philbrick is 
              studying this phenomenon in an explicit phylogenetic framework for  the ca. 50
              species of the genus Callitriche that includes both  underwater and aerial
              pollination systems.  The direction of change  in floral and pollen features
              can be determined, and in turn this  knowledge will allow analysis of cellular
              and biochemical  mechanisms responsible for new floral structure.
