Abstract    :
                This research is to 1) determine earthquake paleoliquefaction                
              features and landforms where they occur by means of remotely-                  
              sensed data, including LANDSAT Thematic Mapper and SPOT                        
              Panochromatic images, and 2) provide new information on the ages               
              and locations of past earthquake in the New Madrid seismic zone                
              (NMSZ).  Focussing o known liquefaction features identified during             
              previous field work, the work will compare possible prehistoric                
              sand blows to those that formed during the great 1811-12 New Madrid            
              earthquakes.  Radiation characteristics unique to the possible                 
              prehistoric features will be used to locate other possible                     
              prehistoric sand blows.  The results of this analysis will be                  
              verified by field investigation at selected sites.  This research              
              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program             
              and is supported under the NSF Career Advancement Award program for            
              women.
