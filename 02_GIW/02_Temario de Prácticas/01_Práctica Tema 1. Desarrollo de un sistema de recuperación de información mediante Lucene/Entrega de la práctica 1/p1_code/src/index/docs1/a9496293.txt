Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project investigates the synthesis and processing of mixed                
              barium lead titanate crystals for use as a new nonlinear optical               
              material with improved properties.  Barium titanate is widely used             
              as a photorefractive optical material, but is not suitable for                 
              nonlinear optical applications such as frequency doubling and                  
              parametric amplification.  The addition of lead to form the mixed              
              barium lead titanate crystal increases the spontaneous polarization            
              and could possibly increase the birefringence and the nonlinear                
              susceptibility.  Major emphasis of the project will be on a study              
              of the crystal growth parameters necessary for growth of large,                
              homogeneous single crystals of good optical quality; a detailed                
              program of materials characterization will also be performed                   
              utilizing optical, X-ray, and chemical analyses.  Many of the                  
              fundamental properties being addressed on this project will be of              
              interest for technological applications, such as optical data                  
              processing.
