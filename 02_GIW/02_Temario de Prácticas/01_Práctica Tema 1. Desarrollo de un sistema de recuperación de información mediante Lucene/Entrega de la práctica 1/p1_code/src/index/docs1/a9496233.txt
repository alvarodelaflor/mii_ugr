Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              focus on the strong nuclear interactions.  An attempt will be                  
              made to show how quantum chromodynamics, the theory of these                   
              interactions, makes bound states of light quarks look from the                 
              outside like the single, heavier quarks suggested by experiment                
              as the constituents of matter.  This work, to be carried out by                
              one of the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1990, is                   
              important to our understanding of the structure of matter.
