Abstract    :
              Professor John Pople is supported by a grant from The                          
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                
              research in the application of molecular orbital theory to a                   
              wide range of chemically important problems.  The molecular                    
              orbital theory, as implemented through Pople's series of                       
              Gaussian computer programs, has had a very significant impact                  
              on all ares of research in the field of Chemistry, and has                     
              contributed to the fact that Pople is one of the most widely                   
              cited scientists in the world today.                                           
                                                                                             
              Pople plans to continue his algorithm development and research                 
              in the following three areas: 1) the development of additional                 
              new approximations to deal with the electron correlation                       
              problem which are aimed at providing more accurate descriptions                
              of energies, potential surfaces and other physical properties                  
              of molecules; 2) the improvement of computational efficiency of                
              the well-established Hartree-Fock and Moller-Plesset theories                  
              with particular attention being paid to opportunities raised by                
              recent developments in computer hardware; and 3) the                           
              application of molecular orbital theory to problems of current                 
              chemical interest where traditional experimental approaches are                
              difficult to apply.
