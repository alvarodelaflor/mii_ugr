Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the dynamics of random magnetic                 
              systems consisting of two classes: spin-glasses and random-field               
              Ising magnets.  These systems are incompletely understood                      
              theoretically and it is hoped the experiments will shed light on               
              the fundamental physics underlying their dynamical behavior.  The              
              experiments on spin-glasses wil address the relaxation properties              
              of systems with highly degenerate multiple free energy minima.                 
              Temperature cycling is introduced in a new way so that new insights            
              into the movement of the system through phase space can be                     
              followed.  Experiments on random-field Ising magnets below                     
              the transition temperature to experimentally check the predicted               
              the logarithmic growth in time of domains.  These results are                  
              important in understanding the dynamics of these systems.
