Abstract    :
              9310009  Ellison    This research consists of three projects which examine
              economic  systems in which a large population of economic agents try to learn 
              from their past experience.  The first two projects concern agents  who
              frequently interact with others in strategic situations, and  explore whether
              they come to play the game by accumulating  experience about how their
              opponents have played in the past.  The  first project explores the
              plausibility of mixed strategy  equilibria where players are heterogeneous
              because of differing  experience.  The second project explores a fundamental
              assumption  of many models of learning, and argues that because of the dynamics
               of the interactions, learning is more likely to lead to some  equilibrium
              outcomes than to others.  The third project studies  agents choosing between
              competing technologies whose problem is a  social one only because they can
              gain information by looking at the  choices of others.  The research focuses on
              the implications of  very simple behavioral patterns in models which may be
              applied to  such problems as the choice of farming technologies and the 
              structure of labor contracts.    ***
