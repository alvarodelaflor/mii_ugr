Abstract    :
              The authors have previously developed a model of hypertext,                    
              called Trellis, based on the formalism of Petri nets.  As in                   
              other hypertext models, Trellis represents information fragments and           
              the relationships that tie the fragments together.  An important               
              premise underlying Trellis is the claim that the actions of browsing           
              a hypertext should be formally represented.  A formal description              
              of browsing not only permits analysis and verification of the                  
              dynamic properties of a document, but also standardizes the                    
              semantics of browsing by providing a succinct, unambiguous, and                
              implementation-independent definition of behavior.  Within its                 
              notational framework, Trellis provides the ability to synchronize              
              simultaneous traversals of separate paths through the hypertext and            
              the ability to incorporate access considerations into the hypertext,           
              specifyingnodes that can be proven to be visible only to certain               
              classes of browsers.  Trellis is a timed model, permitting                     
              specification of event delays and durations as well as                         
              system-generated invocations.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The investigators conduct two main projects under this research.               
              Both are based on the Trellis hypertext work already accomplished.             
              The first is the development of abstract representation methods that           
              permit the mapping of a single unified hypertext specification into            
              documents suitable for each of many different hypertext systems.               
              This, in turn, can reesult in interchange methods for different                
              hypertext systems based on translation into and out of the unified             
              model.  The second is an authoring language "laboratory" to allow              
              the rapid specification and evaluation of hypertext authoring                  
              languages.  The projects will produce results of both theoretical              
              and practical interest.
