Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator (PI) proposes to conduct                       
              research in the area of distributed communication networks,                    
              with particular emphasis on their design and control.                          
              Research will focus on developing a realistic understanding                    
              of the transient behavior of distributed communication                         
              networks.   The aim is to provide design methodologies for                     
              minimizing the frequency of occurrence of undesirable events                   
              such as buffer overflows and inordinately large delays--the                    
              disruptions principally responsible for performance                            
              degradation in networks.
