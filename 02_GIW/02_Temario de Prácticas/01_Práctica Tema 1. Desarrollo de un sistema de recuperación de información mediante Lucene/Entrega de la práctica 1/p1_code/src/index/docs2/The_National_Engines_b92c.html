<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_National_Engines_b92c.html" title="Edit section: The Train Set">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Train Set</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Starlight Express</i> characters are the creations of a child's dream about his toy train set. The National Engines are ensemble roles, each with a caricature personality mostly portrayed through body language. The roles are physically very demanding of the cast, as the performers race at high speed while wearing bulky, heavy costumes and race helmets that give limited visibility, as well as performing rollerskating stunts to amaze the audience. The performers playing the Nationals also almost invariably understudy the main roles.</p>
<p>The names, roles, and number of National Engines has varied widely from one production to the next. Which engine gets to race in the final is a matter of the host country's politics, characters are replaced to relate to the audience, or cut altogether to save money.</p>
<p>The original London production had a distinct and different design from the Broadway and later productions. The National engines are prime examples of this divide. The London costumes suggest a set of six toy trains, identical apart from having been painted in different colours and quite arbitrarily assigned national identities. That Bobo is blue is logical, but Hashamoto being in yellow has no immediate logic. This emphasises that the characters are toys, and a set, that they are not representing literal railway engines. However the Broadway production (which was the template for all following productions) was redesigned, with a bigger budget and larger ideas. Now the National Engines are as close as possible to the genuine article. They now represent a replica train set, far more costly than a child's toys.</p>

<p>Bobo, from France, is a <a href="../../../../articles/t/g/v/TGV_cb6f.html" title="TGV">TGV</a>, "Trains Grands Vitesse"- "Very Fast Train". He is comedically french in his character, over-the-top mannerisms. In the original London production, Bobo raced with <a href="../../../../articles/a/s/h/Ashley_the_Smoking_Car_f5ab.html" title="Ashley the Smoking Car">Ashley</a> in heat 3 and was narrowly beaten by <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/p/Poppa.html" title="Poppa">Poppa</a> with <a href="../../../../articles/d/u/s/Dustin_the_Big_Hopper_143e.html" title="Dustin the Big Hopper">Dustin</a>. He is heard clearly in The Rap arguing that rather than <a href="../../../../articles/r/u/s/Rusty_the_Steam_Engine_b8c7.html" title="Rusty the Steam Engine">Rusty</a> taking Poppa's place, Bobo should as he came a close second. In the later version of the London show, when two racers from each heat make the final, Bobo and Ashley take the fourth place but are knocked out during the final race. In the Broadway and subsequent productions, Bobo races with <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/f/Buffy_the_Buffet_Car_6218.html" title="Buffy the Buffet Car">Buffy</a> not Ashley, and does not make the final.</p>
<p>In the <b>Japan/Australia tours</b>, Bobo had an identical "brother" by the name of <i>Coco</i>. The ensemble roles were doubled to fill the enormous arena-sized stage. Bobo was replaced in the <b>Mexican</b> production, and cut from the 2003 US and 2004 <b>UK tours</b>.</p>
<p><b>Costume</b> In the original <b>London</b> production, Bobo wore blue and white stripes. His <b>Broadway</b> design is a close copy of the actual TGV design and original orange livery (since replaced on the actual trains by a blue and silver colour scheme.)</p>

<p><a href="../../../../articles/t/r/e/Trenitalia.html" title="Trenitalia">Trenitalia</a> Flamboyantly Italian, Espresso is often very similar to Bobo in style. He races with Buffy and loses, and that's pretty much it for him. In all non-<b>London</b> productions, he races with Ashley. He is cut from the 2003 US and 2004 <b>UK tours</b>. In then Japan/Australia tour he was known as Esspresso, with his twin named "Pendelino".</p>
<p><b>Costume</b> In the original <b>London</b> Espresso was the die-cast toy train painted in red and white stripes. After <b>Broadway</b>, he turned bright yellow. Interestingly He seems to have stolen the logo for <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/a/VIA_Rail_66f3.html" title="VIA Rail">VIA rail Canada</a>.</p>

<p>Originally named Weltschaft, but re-branded Ruhrgold in the 1990s, the German contestant is the <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/InterCityExpress_9203.html" title="InterCityExpress">InterCityExpress</a>. In the original London production, Weltschaft wore grey and green stripes. He raced with Joule in Heat two, but lost to Electra and Pearl. However in Germany he swapped roles with Bobo the French train, so that he wins the 2nd Heat and takes Joule to the final. In the US/UK tours, Ruhrgold appears in the filmed race footage racing with Caboose. His character is the German stereotype, he is work-focussed, efficient, single-minded in accomplishing his mission. In the Japan tour productions he was named Weltschaft, but his twin was "Flying Hamburger".</p>
<p><b>Costume</b> Weltschaft's grey/green costume was emblazoned with the <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/u/Double_headed_eagle.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Double headed eagle">double headed eagle</a> insignia. Ruhrgold wears a costume instantly recognisable as the ICE. However this later costume design is more literal and less detailed than the older National costume designs, making Ruhrgold relatively plain. Within the world of the story, Ruhrgold is an accurate miniature model whereas many of the other characters are generic model engines Control has designated a nationality to.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../articles/t/r/a/Trans-Siberian_Railway_2bd7.html" title="Trans-Siberian Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a> From Russia. Turnov is a hard-working, hard-drinking, hard-fighting mean machine. His hard, uncompromising attitude echoes Wrench's character, making them a well-matched team. When Starlight Express opened on Broadway in 1987, Political subtext was incorporated into the show. The Cold War was still in the air, with the Russians as the Enemy. The <b>RED</b> Caboose is the antagonist of the show, the untrustworthy villain, who races with the Russian. In the UK tour, he races with Ashley. His twin in the Japan/Australia tour was initially simply "Turnov 2", but later was named "Vladimir".</p>
<p><b>Costume</b> Turnov's costume is one of the more constant throughout the productions. He is a grey striped engine with red highlights, and the Soviet hammer and sickle on his chest.</p>

<p>Hashamoto is the <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/i/Shinkansen.html" title="Shinkansen">Shinkansen</a> Bullet train From Japan. His character is that of a ninja, martial arts warrior. He is polite, focussed, and usually portrayed by one of the best skaters in the cast, allowing the character to perform impressive stunts. He races well, and is winning when he loses control and crashes in a spectacular fashion. In the original London production his crash was caused by CB, later it was caused by Krupp. In the German production, although he starts racing with Volta, Caboose's interference causes her to drop out, Hashamoto continuing with Caboose. However Caboose then causes him to crash just before the final bend of the race course. On the US and UK tours, he raced with Buffy.</p>
<p>Hashamoto was renamed in the London revamp to Nintendo. In the Japan/Australia tour, his twin was named Nakamura, and in the later Japan tour he was renamed Hashimoto with his twin being Yamamoto.</p>
<p><b>Costume</b> Hashamoto was originally golden yellow, with the japanese rising sun on his chest. He remained yellow for Broadway, US tour and Las Vegas, however he became blue with white accents for the Japan/Australia tours and German production. The US costume finally became blue for the second US tour.</p>

Mark Hedges as Prince of Wales, UK Tour</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Prince of Wales is a genial, avuncular character, bumbling through the show. He arrives late, and skates in backwards, laughing at his own mistake. He partners with Rocky 1 for the race, however he is scrapped just before heat two, (three in the Original production), allowing Poppa to take his place. He is usually seen again for the finale.</p>
<p>Originally the British Train was the "City of Milton Keynes", an <a href="../../../../articles/a/d/v/Advanced_Passenger_Train_b119.html" title="Advanced Passenger Train">Advanced Passenger Train</a>. His costume was based on this train. he became the "Prince of Wales", the <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/y/Royal_Train_abfc.html" title="Royal Train">Royal Train</a> when the Broadway production opened, providing a source of jokes at the expense of the British Royal family. As a non-racing character he was not included in the Japan/Australia tours or the German production.</p>
<p><b>Costume</b> The London design was green and white stripes with yellow accents, with details of the union flag on his chest and the British Rail symbol incorported into the costumes. The rarely-seen Broadway design painted him silver with the same details.</p>
