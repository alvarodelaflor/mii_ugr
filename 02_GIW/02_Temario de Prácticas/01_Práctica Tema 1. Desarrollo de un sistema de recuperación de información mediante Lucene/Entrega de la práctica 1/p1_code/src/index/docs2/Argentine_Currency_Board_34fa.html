<p>For almost twenty years, up to the end of the 1980s, Argentina experienced hyperinflation, poor or negative <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/o/Gross_domestic_product.html" title="Gross domestic product">GDP</a> growth, a severe lack of confidence in the <a href="../../../../articles/g/o/v/Government_of_Argentina_ef06.html" title="Government of Argentina">national government</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/b/a/n/Banco_Central_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica_Argentina_a583.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Banco Central de la República Argentina">Central Bank</a>, and low levels of <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/p/Capital_%28economics%29.html" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a> <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/v/Investment.html" title="Investment">investment</a>. After eight currency crises since the early 1970s, <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/f/Inflation.html" title="Inflation">inflation</a> peaked in 1989, reaching 3,000&#160;% per annum. Per capita GDP was 10% lower than in 1980, social indicators deteriorated seriously, and the <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/d/Budget_deficit.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Budget deficit">fiscal deficit</a> reached 7.6% of GDP.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the main reason behind this long period of hyperinflation was unsustainable growth of the <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Money_supply.html" title="Money supply">money supply</a> to finance the large fiscal deficits maintained by successive governments. Since Argentina could not participate meaningfully in world capital markets given the great investment risk it posed, the only course available was the financing of these fiscal deficits by monetizing them. This meant that the government levied an <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/f/Inflation_tax.html" title="Inflation tax">inflation tax</a> to pay for the fiscal deficits, which in turn contributed to stalling growth.</p>
<p>Another reason for the instability of the Argentine currency was the fragility of domestic financial institutions. The Argentine banking crisis of 1980 underlined this point, as the Central Bank moved to confiscate the deposits of commercial banks to overcome a <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Money_supply.html" title="Money supply">liquidity</a> crunch.</p>
<p>There were also external factors that further triggered the currency crisis, such as <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/Interest_rate.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Interest rate">interest rate</a> fluctuations. In the early 1980s, for example, the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> imposed tight monetary discipline upon its own institutions, which made it more expensive to borrow money because banks had fewer reserves. At other times, less restrictive <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monetary_policy.html" title="Monetary policy">monetary policy</a> lowered interest rates in the developed economies, resulting in capital flows to <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/v/Developing_country.html" title="Developing country">developing countries</a>, which produced real <a href="../../../../articles/e/x/c/Exchange_rate.html" title="Exchange rate">exchange rate</a> appreciation, ballooning <a href="../../../../articles/c/u/r/Current_account_deficit.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Current account deficit">current account deficits</a>, and, in many cases, full-blown currency crises.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/a/r/g/Argentine_Currency_Board_34fa.html" title="Edit section: The currency board">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The currency board</span></h2>
<p>In July 1989, President <a href="../../../../articles/r/a/%C3%BA/Ra%C3%BAl_Alfons%C3%ADn_fdab.html" title="Raúl Alfonsín">Raúl Alfonsín</a> resigned, and President elect <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/r/Carlos_Menem_3bee.html" title="Carlos Menem">Carlos Menem</a> took office six months in advance. His early attempts to stabilize inflation failed, resulting in further <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/p/Depreciation_%28currency%29.html" title="Depreciation (currency)">depreciation</a> of the <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/s/Austral.html" title="Austral">Austral</a> and a serious reduction in the Central Bank's <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/r/Foreign_currency_reserves.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Foreign currency reserves">foreign currency reserves</a>.</p>
<p>In April 1991, Menem reverted the country's policies according to ideas of <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/s/Washington_Consensus_3adf.html" title="Washington Consensus">Washington Consensus</a> to what was later to be called economic neo-liberalism. This system involved a program of massive <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Privatization.html" title="Privatization">privatization</a> and labor <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/r/Deregulation.html" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> laws, which encouraged <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/r/Foreign_investment.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Foreign investment">foreign investment</a> and infused the country with cash to finance its fiscal deficits. However, the linchpin of the new system was the introduction of the <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Convertibility.html" title="Convertibility">Convertibility</a> System.</p>
<p>At the time, there was much debate in Argentina and abroad about how to control inflation and build confidence in local currencies in order to foster investment and growth. There were three options of exchange rate management available to any government: a <a href="../../../../articles/f/l/o/Floating_exchange_rate.html" title="Floating exchange rate">floating exchange rate</a>, a super-<a href="../../../../articles/f/i/x/Fixed_exchange_rate.html" title="Fixed exchange rate">fixed exchange rate</a> (including the possible use of a <a href="../../../../articles/c/u/r/Currency_board.html" title="Currency board">currency board</a>), or a hybrid system. The hybrid system consisted of various levels of control over exchange rates, and it was discredited in the early 1990s when empirical evidence from several currency crises showed that, in a world of high capital mobility, a semi-fixed exchange rate was very unstable, because it allowed a country with poor monetary policy to exercise too much discretionary power. The consequence was that a government had to choose between either fixed or fully floating exchange rate systems.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of the currency board there was much debate over which currency or currencies to peg the peso against. In the view of many economists, the peso should have been pegged to a basket of currencies from the countries that were Argentina's major trading partners. Others argued that the peso should be pegged to the U.S. dollar because it would provide simplicity of understanding, the highest degree of safety, greater international credibility, and the promise of increased trade with the United States. The latter argument won the day, with both positive and negative consequences.</p>
<p>Argentina's currency board established a fixed pegging of one-to-one parity between the peso and the U.S. dollar. It also guaranteed full convertibility of pesos into U.S. dollars. The government hoped to establish local and international credibility in the peg and to limit the amount of local control over monetary and fiscal policy. The currency board regime intended to stabilize the peso, encourage both foreign and local investment, and foster sustained economic growth.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/a/r/g/Argentine_Currency_Board_34fa.html" title="Edit section: Flaws in implementation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flaws in implementation</span></h2>
<p>The main qualities of an orthodox currency board are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A currency board maintains absolute, unlimited <b><a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Convertibility.html" title="Convertibility">convertibility</a></b> between its notes and coins and the currency against which they are pegged, at a fixed rate of exchange, with no restrictions on current-account or capital-account transactions.</li>
<li>A currency board's foreign currency <b>reserves</b> must be sufficient to ensure that all holders of its notes and coins can convert them into the <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/s/Reserve_currency.html" title="Reserve currency">reserve currency</a> (usually 110–115%).</li>
<li>A currency board only earns <b><a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profit</a></b> from interest on reserves (less the expense of note-issuing), and does not engage in forward-exchange transactions.</li>
<li>A currency board has no discretionary powers to affect <b>monetary policy</b> and does not lend to the government. Governments cannot print money, and can only <a href="../../../../articles/t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a> or borrow to meet their spending commitments.</li>
<li>A currency board does not act as a <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/n/Lender_of_last_resort.html" title="Lender of last resort">lender of last resort</a> to <b>commercial banks</b>, and does not regulate <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/s/Reserve_requirement.html" title="Reserve requirement">reserve requirements</a>.</li>
<li>A currency board does not attempt to manipulate <b><a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/Interest_rate.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Interest rate">interest rates</a></b> by establishing a <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/s/Discount_rate.html" title="Discount rate">discount rate</a> like a <a href="../../../../articles/c/e/n/Central_bank.html" title="Central bank">central bank</a>. The peg with the foreign currency tends to keep interest rates and inflation very closely aligned to those in the country against whose currency the peg is fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Argentine currency board violated all these rules at one time or another, except that of a fixed exchange rate. Full convertibility with the U.S. dollar became jeopardized upon implementation of exchange rate controls that provided a preferential exchange rate for <a href="../../../../articles/e/x/p/Export.html" title="Export">exports</a>. The currency board was allowed to hold up to one-third of its dollar-denominated reserves in the form of <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/n/Bond_%28finance%29.html" title="Bond (finance)">bonds</a> issued by the government of Argentina. It acted as lender of last resort and regulated reserve requirements for commercial banks. And it engaged in monetary policy activities. The impact of all this was to reduce the credibility of the Argentine government's intent, and to put speculative pressure on the peso, despite the peg.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/a/r/g/Argentine_Currency_Board_34fa.html" title="Edit section: Results of the currency board">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Results of the currency board</span></h2>
<p>Argentina implemented its currency board in April 1991. Its main achievement was in controlling inflation, which was brought down from more than 3,000% in 1989 to 3.4% in 1994.</p>
<p>Another major accomplishment of the system was renewed economic growth. Enjoying the high world prices of primary products (Argentina's main exports), GDP grew at an annual rate of 8% between 1991 until the <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/q/Tequila_Effect_2c7b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Tequila Effect">Tequila Effect</a> of 1995. Even after the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1994_economic_crisis_in_Mexico_7da0.html" title="1994 economic crisis in Mexico">Mexican crisis</a>, until 1998 the annual growth rate was 6%.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/International_trade.html" title="International trade">International trade</a> also increased dramatically, reflecting the growing degree of openness of the country. Imports increased from US$ 11.6 billion in 1991 to US$ 32.3 billion in 2000. Likewise, exports also increased from US$ 12.1 billion in 1991 to US$ 30.7 billion in 2000.</p>
<p>Despite these impressive results, there were also negative side effects on social issues, such as increased <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a>, unequal income distribution, increased <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a> levels and decreased <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/g/Wage.html" title="Wage">wage</a> rates. Unemployment increased from 6.1% in 1991 to 15% in 2000 as the fixed exchange rate increased foreign price competition and forced local firms to invest in more advanced technologies that required less <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/b/Labour_%28economics%29.html" title="Labour (economics)">labor</a> and higher <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Productivity.html" title="Productivity">productivity</a>.</p>
<p>Income distribution also showed no improvement — indeed it moved in the wrong direction: the bottom 20% of the population decreased its participation in national income from 4.6% in 1991 to 4.1% in 2000, while the top 20% of the population increased its share of income from 50.4% to 51.4%.</p>
<p>Initially, the poverty rate declined as hyperinflation receded (implying that the inflation tax was primarily absorbed by low-income households), but after the Mexican crisis the trend reversed. Although overall wages increased, they did not benefit all workers equally. Skilled and unskilled workers lost ground compared to managerial and professional income groups.</p>
<p>Government debt increased sharply. Unwilling or unable to raise taxes, and precluded from printing money by the currency board system, the government's only other recourse to finance its budget deficit was to issue debt instruments in the capital markets. Public debt increased sharply from 29.5% of GDP in 1993 to 50.3% in 1999. Moreover, this debt was in foreign currency, since the domestic private savings remained low, and it took place despite large inflows of income from the privatization of formerly state-owned companies. Associated with the increase in public debt was an increase in the <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/b/Debt_Service_Ratio_f2cb.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Debt Service Ratio">debt service ratio</a>, which increased from 22% of exports in 1993 to 35.2% in 1999, exacerbating an increasing <a href="../../../../articles/c/u/r/Current_account_deficit.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Current account deficit">current account deficit</a>.</p>
<p>Part of President Menem's program included large-scale privatization of state-owned companies. Unfortunately, because of the fixed exchange rate, privatization agreements generally linked price increase flexibility to the rate of U.S. inflation, which was often higher than that in Argentina. The relative prices of public utilities thus increased and shifted wealth from the state to the privatized firms — which, without any exchange control restraints, were free to expatriate these windfalls and invest them elsewhere.</p>
<p>External shocks also affected the Argentine currency board. The first was the Mexican crisis of 1994-1995, resulting in a <a href="../../../../articles/l/i/q/Liquidity.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Liquidity">liquidity</a> crunch that drove interest rates sharply higher, stalling growth and spurring unemployment. In quick succession, the ensuing <a href="../../../../articles/a/s/i/Asian_financial_crisis.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Asian financial crisis">1997 Asian</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/r/u/s/Russian_financial_crisis.html" title="Russian financial crisis">1998 Russian</a> financial crises pounded at the economy by further increasing interest rates as foreign investors became much warier of where they invested their assets, continuing to keep the cost of borrowing high for Argentina. The <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> crisis of 1999 probably had the most severe effect, because Brazil is Argentina's largest trading partner, and the crisis was coupled with an appreciating U.S. dollar and a slump in the world prices of primary products. Argentina's competitiveness in world markets was severely hit, given the peso's link to the appreciating U.S. dollar and weakening demand in its northern trading partner. As a result, the economy stalled and subsequently contracted.</p>
<p>These ongoing crises and the strong U.S. dollar in the late 1990s put the spotlight on the decision to peg the peso to the U.S. dollar rather than to a basket of currencies that were better aligned with its trade patterns. While Argentina was mostly trading with countries (<a href="../../../../articles/e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and Brazil) that did not have the U.S. dollar as their currency, the peso was fluctuating according to the U.S. dollar and not according to Argentina's actual economic position (this is known as the "third currency phenomenon"). Simply put, the dollar peg overvalued the peso in the rest of the world, especially against a weak <a href="../../../../articles/e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">euro</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/a/Brazilian_real.html" title="Brazilian real">Brazilian real</a>, reducing Argentina's competitiveness and compounding the account deficit.</p>
<p>==changing the peg to a currency basket of U.S. dollars and euros (which would have entailed an effective and controlled <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/v/Devaluation.html" title="Devaluation">devaluation</a> of the peso), and dollarization (using U.S. dollars as the country's only currency).</p>
<p>In December 2001, Argentina suspended payments on its external debt and restricted bank deposit withdrawals. In January 2002, it repealed the Convertibility Law and adopted a new, provisional fixed exchange rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar (a 29% devaluation); soon afterward it completely abandoned its peg and allowed the peso to float freely, resulting in a swift <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/p/Depreciation_%28currency%29.html" title="Depreciation (currency)">depreciation</a> of the peso, which lost 75% of its value with respect to the U.S. dollar in a matter of months.</p>
