<p>Bernhard Woldemar Schmidt was the son of Carl Constantin and Marie Helene Christine (<i>née</i> Rosen) Schmidt. He grew up on the island of <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/i/Naissaar.html" title="Naissaar">Naissaar</a> (called "Nargen" in German), off the coast of <a href="../../../../articles/t/a/l/Tallinn.html" title="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>. The inhabitants of this island, mainly <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/t/Estonian_Swedes_d498.html" title="Estonian Swedes">Estonian Swedes</a>, generally spoke <a href="../../../../articles/s/w/e/Swedish_language.html" title="Swedish language">Swedish</a> or <a href="../../../../articles/e/s/t/Estonian_language.html" title="Estonian language">Estonian</a>, but the Schmidt family spoke <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> at home, despite their ethnic heritage as Estonians. Bernhard was the oldest of six children, three boys (one of whom died in infancy) and three girls.</p>
<p>Naissaar was a small, very rural island whose population mainly supported themselves through fishing and piloting ships into the port of Tallinn (called "Reval" in German). With his younger brother August Fredrik, Bernhard Schmidt engaged in many childhood adventures on the island. He was an extremely inquisitive, inventive, and imaginative young person and adult. For example, when young he built his own camera from a purchased lens and old concertina bellows and succeeded in photographing the village chapel near his familiy's home. He also became fascinated with the night sky and constellations. One night he and August created their own meteor shower by shooting hot embers into the sky with sling shots, until they accidentally set the roof of their house on fire.</p>
<p>Another adventure, however, proved tragic and marked Schmidt for the rest of his life. When he was 15 years old, he experimented with <a href="../../../../articles/g/u/n/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>. He packed an iron pipe with a charge, but through a mistake with the fuse the pipe exploded, and he lost the thumb and index finger of his right hand. Despite his mother's attempts to clean and bandage the wounds, surgeons in Tallinn later amputated the whole hand along with the forearm. When Schmidt returned from Tallinn, his family noticed a change in his behavior: he became reserved and introspective, qualities that seem to have grown more pronounced later in life.</p>

<p>In spite of his loss, Schmidt was soon experimenting and inventing again. He built a dynamo and got August to crank it. He also took more photos and became adept at developing and printing them. In <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a> he moved to <a href="../../../../articles/t/a/l/Tallinn.html" title="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>, and for a time worked at retouching photographs. Later he worked for the Volta Electrical Motor Works and became skilled in drafting. Then in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a> he went to <a href="../../../../articles/g/o/t/Gothenburg.html" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, to study at the <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chalmers_University_of_Technology_d47e.html" title="Chalmers University of Technology">Chalmers University of Technology</a>, but soon thereafter switched to the <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/c/Hochschule.html" title="Hochschule">Hochschule</a> <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/t/Mittweida.html" title="Mittweida">Mittweida</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> to further his education.</p>

<p>During this period his interest in astronomy and optics increased. In Mittweida he had hoped to study with Dr. Karl Strehl, a noted optical theorist. Strehl, however, had recently departed. Gradually, Schmidt found his true calling, namely the grinding and polishing of highly precise optics for astronomical applications. He seems to have begun the grinding of mirrors sometime around 1901, and thereafter began to sell some of his products to amateur astronomers. By March 1904, he had made so much progress in his new endeavor that after finishing his studies, he was soon in contact with professionals at the major observatories in Germany. His business rapidly took off when noted astronomers such as H.C. Vogel, and K. Schwarzschild realized the excellence of Schmidt's mirrors for their researches.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Bernhard_Schmidt_a683.html" title="Edit section: Mittweida Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mittweida Years</span></h2>
<p>Between 1904 and 1914, Schmidt's business boomed and he acquired an immense reputation in Germany. Not only did he produce some of the most difficult and precise mirrors ever attempted up to that time, but he was entrusted with correcting and improving lenses originally supplied by famous optical houses, for example the 50cm Steinheil visual refractor at the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory. As his business increased, he hired several assistants, two of whom have left valuable accounts of Schmidt's working methods. Schmidt also bought an automobile, a rare luxury then, and employed a chauffeur. Using a long focus horizontal mirror and a plane coelostat, both of his own manufacture, he took impressive photos of the sun, moon, and major planets. When one considers that he did much of the fabrication literally using just one hand, it is difficult not to be astonished at Schmidt's skill.</p>
<p>World War I brought the boom to an end. Schmidt was arrested as an enemy-alien (Estonia belonged to the Russian Empire) and was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp for a time. After his release, he remained under police control and some of his suspicious-looking astronomical equipment was confiscated. He attempted to continue his business, but as the war dragged on and turned to defeat for Germany, the economy became grim and scientists had no money for astronomy. The situation did not improve after the war because of the political turmoil in Germany and the need to pay war reparations. Inflation galloped out of control in 1923 and many people lost their entire savings. By the mid 1920s, Schmidt's business was ruined and he had to liquidate his remaining equipment as junk.</p>
<p><a name="Bergedorf" id="Bergedorf"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Bernhard_Schmidt_a683.html" title="Edit section: Bergedorf">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bergedorf</span></h2>
<p>From 1916 onward Schmidt had been in contact with Professor <a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Schorr_847d.html" title="Richard Schorr">Richard Schorr</a>, the director of the <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/m/Hamburg_Observatory_5a68.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hamburg Observatory">Hamburg Observatory</a>, a facility located outside <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in the countryside near the village of <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Bergedorf.html" title="Bergedorf">Bergedorf</a>. Schorr had become interested in Schmidt's horizontal mirror and coelostat telescope and ordered one to be built for his observatory. After the war when Schmidt's economic situation became increasingly difficult, Schmidt began making overtures to Schorr for some kind of work at the observatory. Schorr had only a little to offer: Schmidt could come to Bergedorf and lodge for free; there was repair work to do on the horizontal telescope, for which he would be paid a small fee. This was in 1926. For a time Schmidt did not accept. He had a number of patents to his credit, one of which involved using a wind-driven propeller to power boats forward. Schmidt hoped to turn this invention into something profitable. He also went back to Estonia for a family visit and to scout out opportunities in optics. Estonia had become an autonomous country after World War I.</p>
<p>Nothing came of these efforts, and by 1927 Schmidt's prospects were so poor that he accepted Schorr's offer. He began to establish a workshop in the basement of the Main Service Building at the observatory and to repair the horizontal telescope. During 1927 and 1929, Schmidt participated in two solar eclipse expeditions mounted by the Hamburg Observatory, the first to northern Sweden and the second to the <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. It was during this second trip that Schmidt announced to his companion, the astronomer <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/l/Walter_Baade_5914.html" title="Walter Baade">Walter Baade</a>, the most important invention of Schmidt's lifetime, indeed an invention that revolutionized astronomy and optical design in the second half of the 20th century, namely his wide-angle reflective camera.</p>
<p><a name="The_Schmidt_Camera" id="The_Schmidt_Camera"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Bernhard_Schmidt_a683.html" title="Edit section: The Schmidt Camera">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/h/Schmidt_Camera_74d6.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Schmidt Camera">Schmidt Camera</a></span></h2>
<p>Astronomers had long wished for a way to photograph large swathes of the sky quickly for the purpose of surveying the visible contents of the universe and seeing large-scale structures. Ordinary telescopes up till Schmidt's time showed narrow fields of view, typically measuring 1 or 2 degrees in diameter. Surveying the whole sky with such telescopes required an enormous investment of time and resources over years and (because of the narrow views and long exposure times) tended to miss large structures. It was possible to see large swathes with small camera lenses, but then faint (and hence far away) objects would remain invisible. What was needed was large aperture cameras possessing wide fields of good imaging properties ("definition"), and fast focal ratios to decrease exposure times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only large aperture wide-field telescopes before Schmidt were ordinary reflecting telescopes of short focal ratio (about f/3), and these presented images which while sharp at the middle of their fields of view, quickly lost their definition away from the field center. Star images became bloated and comet-shaped, with the head of the "comet" pointing to the middle of the photographic field. This bloating results mainly from the optical aberrations (i.e. errors) called "coma" and "astigmatism." Before Schmidt it was impossible to build a large, fast reflector telescope which was not plagued by these errors.</p>
<p>Schmidt was well-aware of this and had been pondering possible solutions during the late 1920s. According to Baade, he had abandoned at least one solution already, when finally he hit upon his ultimate design, which involved a novel, indeed bold departure from traditional optical designs. Schmidt realized that by employing a large spherically shaped mirror (instead of the normal paraboloidal mirror of a reflector telescope) and a smaller apertured diaphragm placed at the center of curvature of the mirror, he could at a stroke eliminate coma and astigmatism. He would be left, however, with spherical aberration which is just as damaging to image sharpness.</p>
<p>His boldness lies in realizing that he could eliminate the spherical aberration by placing a thin, very weakly curved lens ("correction plate") of special smooth shape (convex near its middle, concave near its periphery, and flat in between) at the same location as the apertured diaphragm. In this way, very neatly and simply he could construct a large camera of f/1.75 or even faster, that would give sharp images across a field more than 15 degrees in diameter, making it possible to image large swathes of sky with short exposures (on the order of a few minutes versus an hour or more with a conventional reflector). His first camera had an aperture of about 360mm or 14.5" in diameter, and a focal ratio of f/1.75. It is now housed in a museum at the <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/m/Hamburg_Observatory_5a68.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hamburg Observatory">Hamburg Observatory</a>. Schmidt's combining of diverse optical elements (a special mirror, a diaphragm at a particular location, and a "correction plate") into a simple <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/t/Catadioptric.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Catadioptric">catadioptric</a> system, based on reasoning from first principles, was epoch making. In particular, the "correction plate" was like nothing ever seen before in telescope design. After Schmidt a flood of new catadioptric designs appeared in the subsequent decades. But none can match the simplicity together with the optical excellence of the Schmidt system.</p>

<p>Schmidt built his first camera in 1930. He employed a very clever method (the so-called "vacuum pan" method) to make the difficult "corrector plate," so that the system gave superb images. The vacuum pan involved carefully warping the glass lens under partial vacuum and then polishing a smooth curve into it. After release of the vacuum, the lens would spring back into the "Schmidt shape" needed for the camera. No one had ever made a lens in this way before.</p>
<p>Schmidt published a brief account (in German) of his invention in professional publications, and offered to build his cameras for professional observatories. Unfortunately, his publicity was too little and his design was too novel. Moreover, the invention coincided with the beginning of the <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. No orders came in and he remained dependent on Schorr and Bergedorf for a modest income from occasional jobs till the end of his life. He produced a larger camera in 1934 and reground the 60cm Bergedorf-Steinheil photographic refractor as well. Bernhard Schmidt fell ill at the end of November, 1935, after a business trip to <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/i/Leiden.html" title="Leiden">Leiden</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" class="mw-redirect" title="The Netherlands">The Netherlands</a>. He appears to have been overtaken by <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/l/Delirium_Tremens_6a06.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Delirium Tremens">Delirium Tremens</a>. Schorr had to put him in the hospital, where he remained (highly agitated and under restraint) for about a week. Despite treatment, he died at the age of 56 on <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>. An <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/t/Autopsy.html" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a> revealed that he was suffering from a lung infection, and <a href="../../../../articles/p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> was given as the cause of death. Whether the agitation and hallucination were linked to his alcohol consumption is not known.</p>

<p>Schmidt never married. Perhaps the loss of his arm discouraged attempts at physical intimacy. During his Mittweida years, he seems to have become close to Elfriede Groh who referred to him as <i>Mein Bernhard.</i> According to a letter she sent to the Bergedorf astronomer Arthur Arno Wachmann, at the time of her marriage to another man, Schmidt expressed how fond he was of her. It appears that over time, Schmidt began to drink liquor more heavily. In his last years at Bergedorf, he was reputed to go on regular drinking binges ("Bierreisen") every few months. Perhaps this was the product of unhappiness, as his nephew and biographer Erik Schmidt (son of August Fredrik Schmidt) suggests. After all, Schmidt had owned his own business, had employees, and a car. He had achieved fame and respect in his chosen field. He surely cherished high hopes for the future before World War I. And he did this all without the use of his right hand. Then his hopes were completely dashed by the external world, and he became dependent against his will. He finished his life working in the basement of the Bergedorf Observatory, no one ordering his new coma-free cameras.</p>
<p>Soon after his death, and in large part through the advocacy of <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/l/Walter_Baade_5914.html" title="Walter Baade">Walter Baade</a> when he arrived at the <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/u/Mount_Wilson_Observatory_e622.html" title="Mount Wilson Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a> in the United States, the Schmidt telescope idea took off. An 18" Schmidt was produced in 1938 and then ten years later, the famous 48" Samuel Oschin Schmidt-telescope was built at <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/u/Mount_Palomar_Observatory_d3b9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Mount Palomar Observatory">Mount Palomar Observatory</a>. This last telescope produced a flood of new observations and information. It proved the brilliance of the Schmidt concept beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Subsequently at Bergedorf in 1955 a large, well-constructed Schmidt was dedicated. But the 2-meter Schmidt telescope of the <a href="../../../../articles/k/a/r/Karl_Schwarzschild_Observatory_6677.html" title="Karl Schwarzschild Observatory">Karl Schwarzschild Observatory</a> remains the largest Schmidt camera in the world.</p>
