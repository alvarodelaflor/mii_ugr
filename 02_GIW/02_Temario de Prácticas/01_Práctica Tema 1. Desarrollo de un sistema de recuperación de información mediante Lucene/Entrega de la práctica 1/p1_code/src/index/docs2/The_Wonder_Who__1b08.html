<p>In 1961, on a handshake between Valli and Gaudio at a <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/Union_Township%2C_Union_County%2C_New_Jersey_6dc1.html" title="Union Township, Union County, New Jersey">Union Township, Union County, New Jersey</a> bowling establishment, the Four Lovers became The Four Seasons (named after the site of a failed audition). The session work (and recording under various names) continued, but now with Valli, Gaudio, and Crewe trying to sell both Gaudio compositions and Four Seasons recordings, the group finally achieved national distribution under its own name for the first time in four years.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> While the first single failed to sell, the second one, "<a href="../../../../articles/s/h/e/Sherry_%28song%29.html" title="Sherry (song)">Sherry</a>", started a string of successes for The Four Seasons. From 1962 to 1966, it has been estimated that The Four Seasons had sold about 50 million records, more than any recording act except <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the midst of a royalty dispute with <a href="../../../../articles/v/e/e/Vee-Jay_Records_acf8.html" title="Vee-Jay Records">Vee-Jay Records</a> in late 1963, the Four Seasons left the label for <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/i/Philips_Records_84c7.html" title="Philips Records">Philips</a>.

With the blessing of Philips officials, Valli rekindled his "solo" career in the latter part of 1965, releasing records that were credited to him and having the group as backing musicians. In 1966 and 1967, Four Seasons records and Frankie Valli singles were listed in the <i><a href="../../../../articles/b/i/l/Billboard_%28magazine%29.html" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a></i> <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/t/Hot_100.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hot 100">Hot 100</a> chart, with both names appearing simultaneously in the chart in several issues of the magazine.</p>

<p>On the heels of recording a live album of Broadway tunes (to complete the settlement of the group's lawsuit with Vee-Jay), Valli, Crewe, and Gaudio had planned on recording an album consisting entirely of songs written by <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, but as recording progressed, the concept was modified to include songs by <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/r/Burt_Bacharach_571b.html" title="Burt Bacharach">Burt Bacharach</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/l/Hal_David_36d6.html" title="Hal David">Hal David</a>. Valli was not happy with his vocals on the various takes of "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" when he decided to record the song with a "joke" falsetto vocal to reduce the tension in the studio.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>An executive of Philips Records heard a replay of the recording with a "joke" vocal and wanted it to be released as a single — Two years earlier, <a href="../../../../articles/p/e/t/Peter%2C_Paul%2C_and_Mary_5895.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Peter, Paul, and Mary">Peter, Paul, and Mary</a> had reached the #9 position on the Hot 100 with <i>their</i> version of the song — but the recording by Valli and the band could not be released as either a Valli "solo" single or a Four Seasons single. Sold in a picture sleeve with a <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Connect_the_dots.html" title="Connect the dots">connect the dots</a> puzzle, the record with the truncated name ("Don't Think Twice") was released as by "The Wonder Who?" in the November 1965.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> It reached #12 on the Hot 100, and as it was sliding down the chart in January 1966, a Frankie Valli single ("(You're Gonna) Hurt Yourself") and a Four Seasons single ("<a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/Working_My_Way_Back_to_You_e8b8.html" title="Working My Way Back to You">Working My Way Back to You</a>") were also in the upper half of the chart, giving three simultaneous hit records by the group under different guises.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the wake of "Don't Think Twice", Vee-Jay reissued a Four Seasons recording, "Peanuts" (originally a 1957 hit by Little Joe and the Thrillers), as by "The Wonder Who" (without the question mark).<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> As was the case with previous Four Seasons releases of the song, the "Wonder Who" single didn't sell and didn't chart.</p>
<p>Two more "Wonder Who?" singles were released by Philips. Three of the four sides made it onto the lower reaches of the Hot 100.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>"Don't Think Twice" and the other charting "Wonder Who?" recordings were included on Four Seasons albums, which, in their original releases, made no mention of the name that was created for single release.</p>
<p>While "Lonesome Road" became the last "Wonder Who?" single, the group continued to release both Four Seasons and Frankie Valli "solo" singles until 1975, when Valli had recorded "Swearin' to God" without any participation from the group (his previous hit, "<a href="../../../../articles/m/y/_/My_Eyes_Adored_You_9576.html" title="My Eyes Adored You">My Eyes Adored You</a>" was recorded as a Four Seasons recording, but was released a year later as a "solo" record).</p>
