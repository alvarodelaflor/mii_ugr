<p>Dare was born <b>Phyllis Constance Haddie Dones</b> in Chelsea, <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, England, in 1890. Her father, Arthur Albert Dones, was a divorce clerk, and her mother was Harriette Amelia Wheeler. Dare was the youngest of three children. Her sister, <a href="../../../../articles/z/e/n/Zena_Dare_e778.html" title="Zena Dare">Zena</a>, three and a half years her senior, also became a well-known musical comedy actress. They had a brother named Jack.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Dare's first performance on stage was in 1899, at the age of nine, in the Christmas <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/n/Pantomime.html" title="Pantomime">pantomime</a> <i>Babes in the Woods</i> at the Coronet Theatre in London. Her sister Zena was also cast in this production, and they both adopted the surname of Dare. The next year, Phyllis was cast as Christina in a production of <i><a href="../../../../articles/i/b/_/Ib_and_Little_Christina_15cb.html" title="Ib and Little Christina">Ib and Little Christina</a></i> at the <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales%27s_Theatre_2e87.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Prince of Wales's Theatre">Prince of Wales's Theatre</a>, and she ended the year in the Christmas pantomime <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i> in Manchester. In 1901, she played one of the children in <i>The Wilderness</i>, and <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/y/Seymour_Hicks_26c5.html" title="Seymour Hicks">Seymour Hicks</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/l/Ellaline_Terriss_22c8.html" title="Ellaline Terriss">Ellaline Terriss</a> cast her as Mab in their musical <i>Bluebell in Fairyland</i>. The following Christmas, she performed in a production of <i>The Forty Thieves</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-CP_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CP-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dare took a few years off to concentrate on her studies. During this period, in March 1903, she received a marriage proposal from <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harry_Primrose%2C_6th_Earl_of_Rosebery_61ef.html" title="Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery">Lord Dalmeny</a>. His family did not approve and had the young nobleman rapidly shipped off to Scotland.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> When her sister Zena received a proposal from Maurice Brett, the second son of <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/r/Lord_Esher_4348.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Esher">Lord Esher</a>, his family approved, and the two married in 1911.</p>
<p>In 1905, just after her fifteenth birthday, Dare took over the starring role of Angela in <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Catch_of_the_Season_97be.html" title="The Catch of the Season">The Catch of the Season</a></i> from Terriss. The role had been created by Dare's sister Zena. Dare next appeared in a pantomime of <i>Cinderella</i> in <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_155c.html" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle</a>. She left the stage abruptly and travelled to a <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> convent to continue her studies. A rumour circulated that her sudden departure was a result of a pregnancy.<sup id="cite_ref-CP_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CP-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In any event, she returned to London with her father in haste in 1906 to take over the title role, on short notice, of Julia Chaldicott, in <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Belle_of_Mayfair_e764.html" title="The Belle of Mayfair">The Belle of Mayfair</a></i> when <a href="../../../../articles/e/d/n/Edna_May_20ba.html" title="Edna May">Edna May</a> left the cast at the <a href="../../../../articles/v/a/u/Vaudeville_Theatre_5e15.html" title="Vaudeville Theatre">Vaudeville Theatre</a>.
