<p><i><b>Sir Francis Drake</b></i> (aka <i><b>The Adventures of Sir Francis Drake</b></i>) was a British adventure <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/l/Television_series.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Television series">television series</a> starring <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/r/Terence_Morgan_e8af.html" title="Terence Morgan">Terence Morgan</a> as Sir <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/Francis_Drake_386b.html" title="Francis Drake">Francis Drake</a>, commander of the sailing ship the <i><a href="../../../../articles/g/o/l/Golden_Hind_e803.html" title="Golden Hind">Golden Hind</a></i>. As well as battles at sea, sword fights, the series also deals with intrigue at Elizabeth's court, often caused by Spaniard, Mendoza.</p>
<p>The series was originally shown on UK network <a href="../../../../articles/a/s/s/Associated_TeleVision_4ff6.html" title="Associated TeleVision">ATV</a> from <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> till <a href="../../../../articles/a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> and later aired on <a href="../../../../articles/n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> from <a href="../../../../articles/j/u/n/June_24.html" title="June 24">June 24</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> to <a href="../../../../articles/s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>. The 26 episodes were half-hour (actually 25 minutes) long and were a joint <a href="../../../../articles/a/s/s/Associated_British_Corporation_816d.html" title="Associated British Corporation">ABC</a>/ATV production, made at <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/s/Elstree_Studios_4490.html" title="Elstree Studios">Elstree Studios</a> and on historical sites in England. More money was spent on this series than <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Buccaneers_0244.html" title="The Buccaneers">The Buccaneers</a> series. Historical research was by E. Hayter Preston. <a href="../../../../articles/i/v/o/Ivor_Slaney_0926.html" title="Ivor Slaney">Ivor Slaney</a> directed the theme tune, which is the only background music played in the shows. Beatrice Dawson designed the many period costumes worn in the show. Produced by <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/t/Anthony_Bushell_b5ec.html" title="Anthony Bushell">Anthony Bushell</a>, directed by <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/i/Clive_Donner_4b22.html" title="Clive Donner">Clive Donner</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harry_Booth_4025.html" title="Harry Booth">Harry Booth</a> (1961) and story editor was <a href="../../../../articles/i/a/n/Ian_Stuart_Black_b2d6.html" title="Ian Stuart Black">Ian Stuart Black</a>, fights arranged by <a href="../../../../articles/p/e/t/Peter_Diamond_99c0.html" title="Peter Diamond">Peter Diamond</a>. A harbour scene often shown has a painted background, models are used and as in <i>The Bridge</i>, film of a ship is used behind real people on a stage.</p>
<p>The complete series is out on DVD in Region 2. With the DVD collection is a stills gallery. One shows Morgan as Drake playing bowls, alluding to the famous incident when the <a href="../../../../articles/s/p/a/Spanish_Armada_a625.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> was sighted.</p>

Drake evacuates his ship as time for its sinking comes close, staying on board with the Countess.</li>
<li>Episode 2 - Drake pleads the case of the Virginia colony to Elizabeth against Daniel Peters <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Charles_Lloyd_Pack_9eeb.html" title="Charles Lloyd Pack">Charles Lloyd Pack</a> who only wants any gold found and wants the colony shut down, and Walsingham (<a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Warner_f844.html" title="Richard Warner">Richard Warner</a>). We see Mendoza (who is the Spanish Ambassador to the court) for the first time. They discover a stowaway aboard on the way to Virginia, (Olive McFarland) who they take to her husband to be Tom Brewster (<a href="../../../../articles/b/a/r/Barry_Foster_8e0c.html" title="Barry Foster">Barry Foster</a>).

Walsingham decides it is time to get Mary out of the way and has his henchman, Thomas Phillips (Harvey Hall) forge a letter from her to make it look like she wants Elizabeth dead. Drake is sent to check on this but is imprisoned by her captor, Sir Amyas Paulet (<a href="../../../../articles/a/l/f/Alfred_Burke_b10f.html" title="Alfred Burke">Alfred Burke</a>) who is in on the plot too.</li>
<li>Episode 4 - Doctor Dee (<a href="../../../../articles/r/a/y/Raymond_Huntley_1f05.html" title="Raymond Huntley">Raymond Huntley</a>) entertains Elizabeth and her court with some magic tricks. Mendoza's man, Don Pedro steals all Dee's papers and he is forced to make a false astrology chart so the superstitious Queen refuses to allow Drake to sail to Ostend where some Spanish ships are holed up and rescue some English prisoners on them as well as liberating the captured cargo. Drake has to get the papers back for Dee before he can sail.</li>
</ul>
<p>The episode also stars <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/c/Michael_Golden_2f3c.html" title="Michael Golden">Michael Golden</a> as Rafe and Edward Cast as captain of the Guard and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/c/Michael_Crawford_ddae.html" title="Michael Crawford">Michael Crawford</a> sings "<a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greensleeves.html" title="Greensleeves">Greensleeves</a>".</p>

Elizabeth refuses as she does not want to upset Spain. Meanwhile, her emissary, Lord Westbrook (Patrick Holt) is imprisoned at the fort. Drake decides to bring in Sir Richard Bosanquet (<a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Pearson_b327.html" title="Richard Pearson">Richard Pearson</a>) banker, to finance a mission behind Elizabeth's back, to Santo Domingo knowing that if he succeeds, Elizabeth will forgive him but if he fails, she will behead him.</li>

</ul>
<p>The episode also stars Henry Vidon as The Prefect and <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/w/Howard_Lang_e766.html" title="Howard Lang">Howard Lang</a> as Grenville. As Grenville certainly looked the part as Drake's second in command he became a permanent character in the show.</p>

</ul>
<p>Drake and Jack find themselves in a tavern full of Spanish soldiers where the ambassador is held captive. There was a point early in the story where it was shown that the ship's crew lived on very poor food. In the sword fight near the end, the ship's cook (<a href="../../../../articles/v/i/c/Victor_Maddern_249f.html" title="Victor Maddern">Victor Maddern</a>) is seen grabbing all the Spanish food he could to take back to the ship.

Mariella is a young girl who is horrified with the very nasty brat, Carlos who even his father has contempt for. Help is on hand in the form of Drake who is sent as the Queen's emissary to the wedding. To make sure Drake is safe, the Duke of Cordova (<a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Arnatt_2b0e.html" title="John Arnatt">John Arnatt</a>) is a "guest" of Elizabeth in England and Cordova knows many of Phillip's invasion plans for England so Drake is safe in his enemy's hands.

That night a friar persuades Amyas to run away but the friar turns out to a Spaniard, Count Julio (<a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/William_Lucas_%28British_actor%29_1b26.html" title="William Lucas (British actor)">William Lucas</a>) who plans to deliver him and his invention to Spain.</li>

<li>Episode 15 - Elizabeth orders Drake to capture Irish rebel, Lord O'Neill. On the way, Drake is given Grace O'Malley, notorious Irish pirate and decides to use her as a swap for O'Neill with her two sons who each rule a rebel party in Ireland. Things do not go as planned and treachery and fighting is the order of the day.</li>
<li>Episode 16 - The Spanish troops in the Netherlands (who they are at war with) near mutiny as they have not been paid in a long time. Spain is running short on gold so borrow some from merchants in Venice who charge very high rates and they get Elizabeth's promise that the treasure ship will not be plundered by English ships on the way to the Netherlands. Elizabeth knows this money must not arrive to reinforce Spain in Northern Europe so tells Drake that no ENGLISH ship must attack them and Drake notes the emphasis. The episode's title refers to people who use rowing boats to scrounge what they can at sea.</li>

Caught by the Spanish, Mendoza sees this as a chance to blacken Drake's name by having Graveney attack a Dutch ship as Drake (the Dutch are necessary allies as they keep the Spanish busy in the Netherlands so they cannot invade England). Mendoza returns to court and demands Drake be hanged for his murderous attacks on a Spanish and a Dutch ship, supported by a Dutch captain who recognised Drake.</li>
