                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  Empirical and theoretical research previously conducted on                
              the role of emotion in social perception suggests that                         
              investigation of the mechanism responsible for emotional                       
              influences in perception is essential.  This research will test                
              an emotion network model of perceptual memory; new experiments on              
              the perceptual prioritizing (distortion) effects of emotion will               
              also be conducted.  The investigator will collaborate with Dr.                 
              Russell Fazio at Indiana University to improve her use of new                  
              methodology in state of the art equipment for conducting                       
              perception research.
