Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Dr. John Campbell under the                     
              National Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator                  
              Awards program.  The objectives of this program are to provide                 
              research support to the Nation's most outstanding and promising                
              young science and engineering faculty.  The awards are intended                
              to improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to                     
              respond to the demand for highly qualified science and                         
              engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and                 
              teaching.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research in               
              the study of macroeconomics, financial economics, and applied                  
              econometrics.  There are several major broad research questions                
              that are central to his research interests.  One issue is what                 
              determines long-term asset prices.  Another is what determines                 
              aggregate savings behavior.  A third question is what are the                  
              long-run implications of business cycle fluctuations.  All of                  
              these are extremely important areas for research with important                
              policy implications for the U.S economy.
