Abstract    :
              9310112  Swift    This project creates a relational database on congressional 
              history, 1788-1992, that permits secholars, for the first time, to  use easily
              an unprecedented range of variables pertaining to  congressional careers,
              committees, elections, party and roll call  voting, presidential relations, and
              workload.  Some of the material  to be contained in the new database is now
              archived in separate  Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
              Research  databases; other major aspects will be newly created.  What is  truly
              path-breaking about the project, however, is not only the  range and scope of
              the data, but its relational structure.   Scholars will be able to link easily
              data on different  congressional dimensions, facilitating the study of their 
              interrelationship in ways that until now have been virtually  impossible. 
              Project participants will apply this data to their own  research on the
              development of congressional careers; the  institutional impact of party
              realignments; the institutional  effects of elections; the development of
              congressional-presidential  relations; and the potential of national
              legislatures to resolve  sectional conflict.  These are but a few examples of
              the various  kinds of topics scholars will be able to undertake more easily and
               more comprehensively.  ***
