Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Adapting to the stress of European contact and the                        
              accompanying epidemics and military confrontations, the                        
              Mvskoke Creek Indians lived in the Southeastern US until                       
              they were removed to the present state of Oklahoma in 1836.                    
              To preserve their society, they twice enacted new                              
              demographic regimes which were accompanied by a change in                      
              ethnic group membership.  This project hypothesizes that the                   
              first regime, developed in the 18th century, was                               
              necessitated by the low fertility and high mortality of the                    
              frontier situation, and emphasized the acceptance of in-                       
              migrants from societies being fragmented and dispersed by                      
              the expansion of the colonial frontier,  The second regime                     
              was enacted in Indian Territory where the possibilities for                    
              in-migration were limited, and this regime emphasized the                      
              attainment of a fertility level sufficient to balance                          
              mortality.  These hypotheses will be tested by reference to                    
              nineteen censuses and enumerations of the Creeks taken from                    
              1812 to 1910.  Historical and ethnographic information will                    
              be used to put the enumerations into context, and to                           
              determine how cultural institutions were organized and                         
              reorganized to support the demographic regimes.
