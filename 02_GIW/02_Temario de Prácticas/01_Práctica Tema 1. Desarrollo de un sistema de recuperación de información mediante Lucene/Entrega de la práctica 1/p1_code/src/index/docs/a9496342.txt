Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on theoretical and computational                     
              investigations of the flow of electrons in one and two spatial                 
              dimensions in semiconductor devices based on the hydrodynamic                  
              model.                                                                         
                   Semiconductor devices have substantial importance in                      
              engineering and physical applications.
