Abstract    :
                   The integration of services that share resources on a single              
              network has generated an in creasing interest in analyzing models              
              of multiple service, multiple resource (or multi-rate)                         
              communication networks.  The proposed research develops efficient              
              computation algorithms for analyzing large multi-rate-loss                     
              networks.   The principal investigator will develop decomposition              
              algorithms that allow the exact analysis of a large class of                   
              models.  By reducing the analysis to that of a set of subnetworks,             
              the overall dimensionality of the problem and the computational                
              costs are reduced significantly.  This enables the exact efficient             
              computation of performance measures  (e.g. blocking probabilities)             
              in larger models than hitherto possible.  The PI also will develop             
              an approximation method to analyze such models for any size and                
              load.  The success of this effort would result in the development              
              of efficient methods for exact and approximate analysis of                     
              multi-rate networks of practical size and complexity.
