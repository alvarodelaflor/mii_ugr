Abstract    :
              This collaborative proposal explores the effects of replacing                  
              standard probabilities or chance lotteries by uncertain beliefs in             
              the definition of the prospects.  The comparison of attitudes                  
              about prospects in which outcomes are determined by chance or                  
              by the decision maker's knowledge will provide information about               
              the role of personal responsibility in choice.  Second the project             
              investigates cumulative decision making, that is, a series of                  
              choices in which outcomes accumulate in the course of the session.             
              A new experimental paradigm will be developed and                              
              applied to study effects of the amount at stake, mental accounting,            
              previous success and failures and other issues, in the context of              
              cumulative decision making.  By introducing genuine uncertainty and            
              multiple decisions, as well as learning and feedback, this project             
              aims to bring decision research closer to the actual practice of               
              decisions, which typically innvolve unquantified uncertainty and               
              are generally made in the context of other decisions.
