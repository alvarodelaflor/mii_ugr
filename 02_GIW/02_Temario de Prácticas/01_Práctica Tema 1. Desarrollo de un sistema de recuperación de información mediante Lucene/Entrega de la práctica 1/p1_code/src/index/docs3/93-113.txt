IN THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTHERE IS NO ONE LEFT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle\r\neverybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen.\r\nIt was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body,\r\nthin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her\r\nface was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been\r\nill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the\r\nEnglish Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her\r\nmother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and\r\namuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all,\r\nand when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who\r\nwas made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she\r\nmust keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a\r\nsickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when\r\nshe became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the\r\nway also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark\r\nfaces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always\r\nobeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem\r\nSahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time\r\nshe was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as\r\never lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read\r\nand write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three\r\nmonths, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always\r\nwent away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not\r\nchosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have\r\nlearned her letters at all.\r\n\r\nOne frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she\r\nawakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw\r\nthat the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the strange woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not let you\r\nstay. Send my Ayah to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could\r\nnot come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked\r\nher, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not\r\npossible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.\r\n\r\nThere was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was\r\ndone in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed\r\nmissing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and\r\nscared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not\r\ncome. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last\r\nshe wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a\r\ntree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed,\r\nand she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth,\r\nall the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the\r\nthings she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, because to call a native a pig\r\nis the worst insult of all.\r\n\r\nShe was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she\r\nheard her mother come out on the veranda with someone. She was with a\r\nfair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.\r\nMary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that\r\nhe was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child\r\nstared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this\r\nwhen she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib\xe2\x80\x94Mary used to\r\ncall her that oftener than anything else\xe2\x80\x94was such a tall, slim, pretty\r\nperson and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and\r\nshe had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things,\r\nand she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and\r\nfloating, and Mary said they were \xe2\x80\x9cfull of lace.\xe2\x80\x9d They looked fuller of\r\nlace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.\r\nThey were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy\r\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so very bad? Oh, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary heard her say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man answered in a trembling voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAwfully, Mrs.\r\nLennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mem Sahib wrung her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know I ought!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI only stayed to go to that silly\r\ndinner party. What a fool I was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 quarters that she clutched the young man\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and Mary\r\nstood shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Lennox gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone has died,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the boy officer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not say it had\r\nbroken out among your servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know!\xe2\x80\x9d the Mem Sahib cried. \xe2\x80\x9cCome with me! Come with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand she turned and ran into the house.\r\n\r\nAfter that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the\r\nmorning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most\r\nfatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken\r\nill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the\r\nservants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other\r\nservants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic\r\non every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.\r\n\r\nDuring the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid\r\nherself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of\r\nher, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew\r\nnothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only\r\nknew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening\r\nsounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though\r\na partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as\r\nif they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for\r\nsome reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty\r\nshe drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and\r\nshe did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely\r\ndrowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again,\r\nfrightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of\r\nfeet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes\r\nopen and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.\r\n\r\nMany things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily,\r\nbut she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being\r\ncarried in and out of the bungalow.\r\n\r\nWhen she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was\r\nperfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She\r\nheard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got\r\nwell of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who\r\nwould take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new\r\nAyah, and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather\r\ntired of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She\r\nwas not an affectionate child and had never cared much for anyone. The\r\nnoise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened\r\nher, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she\r\nwas alive. Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no\r\none was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they\r\nremembered nothing but themselves. But if everyone had got well again,\r\nsurely someone would remember and come to look for her.\r\n\r\nBut no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more\r\nand more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when\r\nshe looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her\r\nwith eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a\r\nharmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry\r\nto get out of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow queer and quiet it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds as if there were no\r\none in the bungalow but me and the snake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on\r\nthe veranda. They were men\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, and the men entered the\r\nbungalow and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them\r\nand they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat desolation!\xe2\x80\x9d she heard one voice say. \xe2\x80\x9cThat pretty, pretty woman!\r\nI suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever\r\nsaw her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the\r\ndoor a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and\r\nwas frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel\r\ndisgracefully neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer\r\nshe had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled,\r\nbut when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarney!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a child here! A child alone! In a\r\nplace like this! Mercy on us, who is she!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Mary Lennox,\xe2\x80\x9d the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.\r\nShe thought the man was very rude to call her father\xe2\x80\x99s bungalow \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nplace like this!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I\r\nhave only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the child no one ever saw!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the man, turning to his\r\ncompanions. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has actually been forgotten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy was I forgotten?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said, stamping her foot. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does nobody\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even\r\nthought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little kid!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nobody left to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had\r\nneither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried\r\naway in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died\r\nalso had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of\r\nthem even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the\r\nplace was so quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow\r\nbut herself and the little rustling snake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nMISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY\r\n\r\n\r\nMary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had\r\nthought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could\r\nscarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when\r\nshe was gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a\r\nself-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had\r\nalways done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very\r\nanxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and\r\nas she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.\r\nWhat she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to\r\nnice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her\r\nAyah and the other native servants had done.\r\n\r\nShe knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The\r\nEnglish clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same\r\nage and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and\r\nsnatching toys from each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and\r\nwas so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody\r\nwould play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname\r\nwhich made her furious.\r\n\r\nIt was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with\r\nimpudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him. She was\r\nplaying by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day\r\nthe cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for a\r\ngarden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he got\r\nrather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere in the middle,\xe2\x80\x9d and he leaned over her to point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want boys. Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease. He was\r\nalways teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made\r\nfaces and sang and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress Mary, quite contrary,\r\n    How does your garden grow?\r\nWith silver bells, and cockle shells,\r\n    And marigolds all in a row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the\r\ncrosser Mary got, the more they sang \xe2\x80\x9cMistress Mary, quite contrary\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand after that as long as she stayed with them they called her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress Mary Quite Contrary\xe2\x80\x9d when they spoke of her to each other,\r\nand often when they spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to be sent home,\xe2\x80\x9d Basil said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of the\r\nweek. And we\xe2\x80\x99re glad of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know where home is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Basil, with seven-year-old\r\nscorn. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our\r\nsister Mabel was sent to her last year. You are not going to your\r\ngrandmama. You have none. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr.\r\nArchibald Craven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about him,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Basil answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything. Girls\r\nnever do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in a\r\ngreat, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s so cross he won\xe2\x80\x99t let them, and they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come if he would let\r\nthem. He\xe2\x80\x99s a hunchback, and he\xe2\x80\x99s horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her\r\nfingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.\r\n\r\nBut she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford\r\ntold her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few\r\ndays and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at\r\nMisselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested\r\nthat they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind\r\nto her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted\r\nto kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is such a plain child,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very pretty\r\nmanner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a\r\nchild. The children call her \xe2\x80\x98Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,\xe2\x80\x99 and though\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s naughty of them, one can\xe2\x80\x99t help understanding it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty\r\nmanners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty\r\nways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to\r\nremember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she scarcely ever looked at her,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Crawford.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the\r\nlittle thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all\r\nalone in that deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped\r\nout of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by\r\nherself in the middle of the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school.\r\nShe was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was\r\nrather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven\r\nsent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper at\r\nMisselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout\r\nwoman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very\r\npurple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black\r\nbonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she\r\nmoved her head. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom\r\nliked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was\r\nvery evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word! she\xe2\x80\x99s a plain little piece of goods!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nheard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t handed much of it down,\r\nhas she, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she will improve as she grows older,\xe2\x80\x9d the officer\xe2\x80\x99s wife said\r\ngood-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression,\r\nher features are rather good. Children alter so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to alter a good deal,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite\xe2\x80\x94if you ask\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little\r\napart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to.\r\nShe was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she heard\r\nquite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he\r\nlived in. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What\r\nwas a hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nSince she had been living in other people\xe2\x80\x99s houses and had had no Ayah,\r\nshe had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new\r\nto her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to\r\nanyone even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children\r\nseemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed\r\nto really be anyone\xe2\x80\x99s little girl. She had had servants, and food and\r\nclothes, but no one had taken any notice of her. She did not know that\r\nthis was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she\r\ndid not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other people\r\nwere, but she did not know that she was so herself.\r\n\r\nShe thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever\r\nseen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet.\r\nWhen the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she\r\nwalked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and\r\ntrying to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not\r\nwant to seem to belong to her. It would have made her angry to think\r\npeople imagined she was her little girl.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her\r\nthoughts. She was the kind of woman who would \xe2\x80\x9cstand no nonsense from\r\nyoung ones.\xe2\x80\x9d At least, that is what she would have said if she had been\r\nasked. She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid\r\nplace as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which\r\nshe could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her\r\nto do. She never dared even to ask a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Craven had said\r\nin his short, cold way. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Lennox was my wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother and I am\r\ntheir daughter\xe2\x80\x99s guardian. The child is to be brought here. You must go\r\nto London and bring her yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she packed her small trunk and made the journey.\r\n\r\nMary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and\r\nfretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her\r\nthin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her\r\nlook yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under\r\nher black cr\xc3\xaape hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Medlock\r\nthought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.)\r\nShe had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and\r\nat last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk,\r\nhard voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going\r\nto,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything about your uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever heard your father and mother talk about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary frowning. She frowned because she remembered that her\r\nfather and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular.\r\nCertainly they had never told her things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsive\r\nlittle face. She did not say any more for a few moments and then she\r\nbegan again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you might as well be told something\xe2\x80\x94to prepare you. You are\r\ngoing to a queer place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by\r\nher apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot but that it\xe2\x80\x99s a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproud of it in his way\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s gloomy enough, too. The house is six\r\nhundred years old and it\xe2\x80\x99s on the edge of the moor, and there\xe2\x80\x99s near a\r\nhundred rooms in it, though most of them\xe2\x80\x99s shut up and locked. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s pictures and fine old furniture and things that\xe2\x80\x99s been there\r\nfor ages, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a big park round it and gardens and trees with\r\nbranches trailing to the ground\xe2\x80\x94some of them.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused and took\r\nanother breath. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended suddenly.\r\n\r\nMary had begun to listen in spite of herself. It all sounded so unlike\r\nIndia, and anything new rather attracted her. But she did not intend to\r\nlook as if she were interested. That was one of her unhappy,\r\ndisagreeable ways. So she sat still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about such places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are like an old woman. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you care?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I care or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right enough there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. What\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, unless\r\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest way. _He\xe2\x80\x99s_ not going to trouble himself about\r\nyou, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure and certain. He never troubles himself about no one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got a crooked back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat set him wrong. He was a sour\r\nyoung man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was\r\nmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to\r\ncare. She had never thought of the hunchback\xe2\x80\x99s being married and she\r\nwas a trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a\r\ntalkative woman she continued with more interest. This was one way of\r\npassing some of the time, at any rate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a sweet, pretty thing and he\xe2\x80\x99d have walked the world over to\r\nget her a blade o\xe2\x80\x99 grass she wanted. Nobody thought she\xe2\x80\x99d marry him,\r\nbut she did, and people said she married him for his money. But she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94she didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d positively. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she died\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary gave a little involuntary jump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! did she die!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had\r\njust remembered a French fairy story she had once read called \xe2\x80\x9cRiquet \xc3\xa0\r\nla Houppe.\xe2\x80\x9d It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess\r\nand it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she died,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Medlock answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it made him queerer than\r\never. He cares about nobody. He won\xe2\x80\x99t see people. Most of the time he\r\ngoes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the\r\nWest Wing and won\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone but Pitcher see him. Pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s an old\r\nfellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his\r\nways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel\r\ncheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with\r\ntheir doors locked\xe2\x80\x94a house on the edge of a moor\xe2\x80\x94whatsoever a moor\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!\r\nShe stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it\r\nseemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in\r\ngray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If the\r\npretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being\r\nsomething like her own mother and by running in and out and going to\r\nparties as she had done in frocks \xe2\x80\x9cfull of lace.\xe2\x80\x9d But she was not there\r\nany more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see him, because ten to one you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that there will be people to talk\r\nto you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to play about and look after yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ntold what rooms you can go into and what rooms you\xe2\x80\x99re to keep out of.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s gardens enough. But when you\xe2\x80\x99re in the house don\xe2\x80\x99t go wandering\r\nand poking about. Mr. Craven won\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not want to go poking about,\xe2\x80\x9d said sour little Mary and just\r\nas suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald\r\nCraven she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant\r\nenough to deserve all that had happened to him.\r\n\r\nAnd she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the\r\nrailway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as\r\nif it would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadily\r\nthat the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nACROSS THE MOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nShe slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a\r\nlunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold\r\nbeef and bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be\r\nstreaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore\r\nwet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the\r\ncarriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and\r\nchicken and beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep\r\nherself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet\r\nslip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner\r\nof the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the\r\nwindows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had\r\nstopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had a sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to open your eyes! We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nat Thwaite Station and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long drive before us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock\r\ncollected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her,\r\nbecause in India native servants always picked up or carried things and\r\nit seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.\r\n\r\nThe station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be\r\ngetting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a\r\nrough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion\r\nwhich Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see tha\xe2\x80\x99s got back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99s browt th\xe2\x80\x99 young \xe2\x80\x99un with\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that\xe2\x80\x99s her,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire\r\naccent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s thy Missus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell enow. Th\xe2\x80\x99 carriage is waitin\xe2\x80\x99 outside for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary\r\nsaw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who\r\nhelped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of\r\nhis hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the\r\nburly station-master included.\r\n\r\nWhen he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they\r\ndrove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably\r\ncushioned corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She\r\nsat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road\r\nover which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had\r\nspoken of. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly\r\nfrightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in\r\na house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up\xe2\x80\x94a house standing on the\r\nedge of a moor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a moor?\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out of the window in about ten minutes and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we\r\nget to the Manor. You won\xe2\x80\x99t see much because it\xe2\x80\x99s a dark night, but you\r\ncan see something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner,\r\nkeeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a\r\nlittle distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things\r\nthey passed. After they had left the station they had driven through a\r\ntiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a\r\npublic house. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little\r\nshop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set\r\nout for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and\r\ntrees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time\xe2\x80\x94or at\r\nleast it seemed a long time to her.\r\n\r\nAt last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing\r\nup-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more\r\ntrees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either\r\nside. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just\r\nas the carriage gave a big jolt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! We\xe2\x80\x99re on the moor now sure enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\nThe carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which\r\nseemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in\r\nthe great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.\r\nA wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s not the sea, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, looking round at her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cNor it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fields nor\r\nmountains, it\xe2\x80\x99s just miles and miles and miles of wild land that\r\nnothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on\r\nbut wild ponies and sheep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds like the sea just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the wind blowing through the bushes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Medlock said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty that\r\nlikes it\xe2\x80\x94particularly when the heather\xe2\x80\x99s in bloom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped,\r\nthe wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went\r\nup and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge\r\nbeneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary\r\nfelt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide,\r\nbleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was\r\npassing on a strip of dry land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\npinched her thin lips more tightly together.\r\n\r\nThe horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught\r\nsight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a\r\nlong sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, I am glad to see that bit o\xe2\x80\x99 light twinkling,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea\r\nafter a bit, at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was \xe2\x80\x9cafter a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d as she said, for when the carriage passed through\r\nthe park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and\r\nthe trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were\r\ndriving through a long dark vault.\r\n\r\nThey drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an\r\nimmensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone\r\ncourt. At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the\r\nwindows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a\r\ncorner upstairs showed a dull glow.\r\n\r\nThe entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped\r\npanels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron\r\nbars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that\r\nthe faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of\r\narmor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them. As she\r\nstood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black\r\nfigure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.\r\n\r\nA neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to take her to her room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a husky voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see her. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to London in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Mr. Pitcher,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Medlock answered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo long as I know\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s expected of me, I can manage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pitcher said, \xe2\x80\x9cis that you\r\nmake sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s not disturbed and that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see what he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long\r\ncorridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor\r\nand another, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a\r\nroom with a fire in it and a supper on a table.\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here you are! This room and the next are where you\xe2\x80\x99ll live\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyou must keep to them. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she\r\nhad perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nMARTHA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young\r\nhousemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on\r\nthe hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her\r\nfor a few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never\r\nseen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls\r\nwere covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There\r\nwere fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance\r\nthere was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and\r\nhorses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with\r\nthem. Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of\r\nland which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an\r\nendless, dull, purplish sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing out of the window.\r\n\r\nMartha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and\r\npointed also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat there?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 moor,\xe2\x80\x9d with a good-natured grin. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes tha\xe2\x80\x99 like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because tha\xe2\x80\x99rt not used to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Martha said, going back to her\r\nhearth. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s too big an\xe2\x80\x99 bare now. But tha\xe2\x80\x99 will like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that I do,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the\r\ngrate. \xe2\x80\x9cI just love it. It\xe2\x80\x99s none bare. It\xe2\x80\x99s covered wi\xe2\x80\x99 growin\xe2\x80\x99 things\r\nas smells sweet. It\xe2\x80\x99s fair lovely in spring an\xe2\x80\x99 summer when th\xe2\x80\x99 gorse\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 broom an\xe2\x80\x99 heather\xe2\x80\x99s in flower. It smells o\xe2\x80\x99 honey an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s such\r\na lot o\xe2\x80\x99 fresh air\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 sky looks so high an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 bees an\xe2\x80\x99 skylarks\r\nmakes such a nice noise hummin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 singin\xe2\x80\x99. Eh! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live away\r\nfrom th\xe2\x80\x99 moor for anythin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The native\r\nservants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this.\r\nThey were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their\r\nmasters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprotector of the poor\xe2\x80\x9d and names of that sort. Indian servants were\r\ncommanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cplease\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthank you\xe2\x80\x9d and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the\r\nface when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would do\r\nif one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured\r\nlooking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary\r\nwonder if she might not even slap back\xe2\x80\x94if the person who slapped her\r\nwas only a little girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a strange servant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said from her pillows, rather\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\nMartha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, and\r\nlaughed, without seeming the least out of temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there was a grand Missus at\r\nMisselthwaite I should never have been even one of th\xe2\x80\x99 under\r\nhousemaids. I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I\xe2\x80\x99d never have\r\nbeen let upstairs. I\xe2\x80\x99m too common an\xe2\x80\x99 I talk too much Yorkshire. But\r\nthis is a funny house for all it\xe2\x80\x99s so grand. Seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s neither\r\nMaster nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be troubled about anythin\xe2\x80\x99 when he\xe2\x80\x99s here, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s nearly always\r\naway. Mrs. Medlock gave me th\xe2\x80\x99 place out o\xe2\x80\x99 kindness. She told me she\r\ncould never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big\r\nhouses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to be my servant?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked, still in her imperious\r\nlittle Indian way.\r\n\r\nMartha began to rub her grate again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Mrs. Medlock\xe2\x80\x99s servant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99s Mr.\r\nCraven\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m to do the housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s work up here an\xe2\x80\x99 wait on you a\r\nbit. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t need much waitin\xe2\x80\x99 on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is going to dress me?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mary.\r\n\r\nMartha sat up on her heels again and stared. She spoke in broad\r\nYorkshire in her amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCanna\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 dress thysen!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your language,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! I forgot,\xe2\x80\x9d Martha said. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Medlock told me I\xe2\x80\x99d have to be\r\ncareful or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was sayin\xe2\x80\x99. I mean can\xe2\x80\x99t you put on\r\nyour own clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary, quite indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI never did in my life. My\r\nAyah dressed me, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she was\r\nimpudent, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s time tha\xe2\x80\x99 should learn. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 cannot begin younger.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit. My mother always said she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see why grand people\xe2\x80\x99s children didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out fair\r\nfools\xe2\x80\x94what with nurses an\xe2\x80\x99 bein\xe2\x80\x99 washed an\xe2\x80\x99 dressed an\xe2\x80\x99 took out to\r\nwalk as if they was puppies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is different in India,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mistress Mary disdainfully. She could\r\nscarcely stand this.\r\n\r\nBut Martha was not at all crushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! I can see it\xe2\x80\x99s different,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered almost sympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndare say it\xe2\x80\x99s because there\xe2\x80\x99s such a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 blacks there instead o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrespectable white people. When I heard you was comin\xe2\x80\x99 from India I\r\nthought you was a black too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary sat up in bed furious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You thought I was a native. You\xe2\x80\x94you daughter\r\nof a pig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha stared and looked hot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you callin\xe2\x80\x99 names?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be so vexed. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot th\xe2\x80\x99 way for a young lady to talk. I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothin\xe2\x80\x99 against th\xe2\x80\x99 blacks.\r\nWhen you read about \xe2\x80\x99em in tracts they\xe2\x80\x99re always very religious. You\r\nalways read as a black\xe2\x80\x99s a man an\xe2\x80\x99 a brother. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a black\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 I was fair pleased to think I was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to see one close. When I\r\ncome in to light your fire this mornin\xe2\x80\x99 I crep\xe2\x80\x99 up to your bed an\xe2\x80\x99\r\npulled th\xe2\x80\x99 cover back careful to look at you. An\xe2\x80\x99 there you was,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndisappointedly, \xe2\x80\x9cno more black than me\xe2\x80\x94for all you\xe2\x80\x99re so yeller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought I was a native! You dared! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about\r\nnatives! They are not people\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re servants who must salaam to you.\r\nYou know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl\xe2\x80\x99s simple\r\nstare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away\r\nfrom everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw\r\nherself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.\r\nShe sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a\r\nlittle frightened and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bent\r\nover her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t cry like that there!\xe2\x80\x9d she begged. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nsure. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you\xe2\x80\x99d be vexed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anythin\xe2\x80\x99 about\r\nanythin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94just like you said. I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something comforting and really friendly in her queer\r\nYorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary. She\r\ngradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha looked relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for thee to get up now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Medlock said I was\r\nto carry tha\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast an\xe2\x80\x99 tea an\xe2\x80\x99 dinner into th\xe2\x80\x99 room next to this.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been made into a nursery for thee. I\xe2\x80\x99ll help thee on with thy\r\nclothes if tha\xe2\x80\x99ll get out o\xe2\x80\x99 bed. If th\xe2\x80\x99 buttons are at th\xe2\x80\x99 back tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncannot button them up tha\xe2\x80\x99self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the\r\nwardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night\r\nbefore with Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are not mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMine are black.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with\r\ncool approval:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are nicer than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are th\xe2\x80\x99 ones tha\xe2\x80\x99 must put on,\xe2\x80\x9d Martha answered. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Craven\r\nordered Mrs. Medlock to get \xe2\x80\x99em in London. He said \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t have a\r\nchild dressed in black wanderin\xe2\x80\x99 about like a lost soul,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99d make the place sadder than it is. Put color on her.\xe2\x80\x99 Mother she\r\nsaid she knew what he meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold with black hersel\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate black things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nThe dressing process was one which taught them both something. Martha\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cbuttoned up\xe2\x80\x9d her little sisters and brothers but she had never\r\nseen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things\r\nfor her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99 put on tha\xe2\x80\x99 own shoes?\xe2\x80\x9d she said when Mary quietly\r\nheld out her foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Ayah did it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary, staring. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said that very often\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the custom.\xe2\x80\x9d The native servants were\r\nalways saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had\r\nnot done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nnot the custom\xe2\x80\x9d and one knew that was the end of the matter.\r\n\r\nIt had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but\r\nstand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was\r\nready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite\r\nManor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking\r\nup things she let fall. If Martha had been a well-trained fine young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and\r\nwould have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button\r\nboots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an\r\nuntrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland\r\ncottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never\r\ndreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger\r\nones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about\r\nand tumble over things.\r\n\r\nIf Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would\r\nperhaps have laughed at Martha\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to talk, but Mary only\r\nlistened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At first\r\nshe was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in\r\nher good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! you should see \xe2\x80\x99em all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s twelve of us an\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nfather only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nput to it to get porridge for \xe2\x80\x99em all. They tumble about on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 play there all day an\xe2\x80\x99 mother says th\xe2\x80\x99 air of th\xe2\x80\x99 moor fattens \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nShe says she believes they eat th\xe2\x80\x99 grass same as th\xe2\x80\x99 wild ponies do.\r\nOur Dickon, he\xe2\x80\x99s twelve years old and he\xe2\x80\x99s got a young pony he calls\r\nhis own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did he get it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe found it on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor with its mother when it was a little one an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe began to make friends with it an\xe2\x80\x99 give it bits o\xe2\x80\x99 bread an\xe2\x80\x99 pluck\r\nyoung grass for it. And it got to like him so it follows him about an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit lets him get on its back. Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s a kind lad an\xe2\x80\x99 animals likes\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always\r\nthought she should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in\r\nDickon, and as she had never before been interested in anyone but\r\nherself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When she went into\r\nthe room which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it\r\nwas rather like the one she had slept in. It was not a child\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nbut a grown-up person\xe2\x80\x99s room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and\r\nheavy old oak chairs. A table in the center was set with a good\r\nsubstantial breakfast. But she had always had a very small appetite,\r\nand she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate\r\nMartha set before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want thy porridge!\xe2\x80\x9d Martha exclaimed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how good it is. Put a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 treacle on it or a bit\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t abide to see good victuals go to waste. If\r\nour children was at this table they\xe2\x80\x99d clean it bare in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause they scarce ever had their stomachs full\r\nin their lives. They\xe2\x80\x99re as hungry as young hawks an\xe2\x80\x99 foxes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is to be hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, with the\r\nindifference of ignorance.\r\n\r\nMartha looked indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it would do thee good to try it. I can see that plain enough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said outspokenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no patience with folk as sits an\xe2\x80\x99 just\r\nstares at good bread an\xe2\x80\x99 meat. My word! don\xe2\x80\x99t I wish Dickon and Phil\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 Jane an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 rest of \xe2\x80\x99em had what\xe2\x80\x99s here under their pinafores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you take it to them?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not mine,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Martha stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 this isn\xe2\x80\x99t my day out. I\r\nget my day out once a month same as th\xe2\x80\x99 rest. Then I go home an\xe2\x80\x99 clean\r\nup for mother an\xe2\x80\x99 give her a day\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wrap up warm an\xe2\x80\x99 run out an\xe2\x80\x99 play you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do you\r\ngood and give you some stomach for your meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees,\r\nbut everything looked dull and wintry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut? Why should I go out on a day like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if tha\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go out tha\xe2\x80\x99lt have to stay in, an\xe2\x80\x99 what has tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngot to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Medlock had\r\nprepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. Perhaps it would\r\nbe better to go and see what the gardens were like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will go with me?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\nMartha stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll go by yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to learn to play\r\nlike other children does when they haven\xe2\x80\x99t got sisters and brothers.\r\nOur Dickon goes off on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor by himself an\xe2\x80\x99 plays for hours. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhow he made friends with th\xe2\x80\x99 pony. He\xe2\x80\x99s got sheep on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor that\r\nknows him, an\xe2\x80\x99 birds as comes an\xe2\x80\x99 eats out of his hand. However little\r\nthere is to eat, he always saves a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 his bread to coax his pets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out,\r\nthough she was not aware of it. There would be, birds outside though\r\nthere would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the\r\nbirds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.\r\n\r\nMartha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots\r\nand she showed her her way downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf tha\xe2\x80\x99 goes round that way tha\xe2\x80\x99ll come to th\xe2\x80\x99 gardens,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\npointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots o\xe2\x80\x99 flowers in\r\nsummer-time, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 bloomin\xe2\x80\x99 now.\xe2\x80\x9d She seemed to hesitate\r\na second before she added, \xe2\x80\x9cOne of th\xe2\x80\x99 gardens is locked up. No one has\r\nbeen in it for ten years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another locked door\r\nadded to the hundred in the strange house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won\xe2\x80\x99t let no\r\none go inside. It was her garden. He locked th\xe2\x80\x99 door an\xe2\x80\x99 dug a hole and\r\nburied th\xe2\x80\x99 key. There\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Medlock\xe2\x80\x99s bell ringing\xe2\x80\x94I must run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in\r\nthe shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no\r\none had been into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like\r\nand whether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had\r\npassed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens,\r\nwith wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were\r\ntrees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and\r\na large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the\r\nflower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This\r\nwas not the garden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up?\r\nYou could always walk into a garden.\r\n\r\nShe was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path\r\nshe was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing\r\nover it. She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was\r\ncoming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were\r\ngrowing. She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door\r\nin the ivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden,\r\nevidently, and she could go into it.\r\n\r\nShe went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all\r\nround it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which\r\nseemed to open into one another. She saw another open green door,\r\nrevealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter\r\nvegetables. Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over\r\nsome of the beds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly\r\nenough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be\r\nnicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty\r\nabout it now.\r\n\r\nPresently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the\r\ndoor leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he saw\r\nMary, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did not\r\nseem at all pleased to see her\xe2\x80\x94but then she was displeased with his\r\ngarden and wore her \xe2\x80\x9cquite contrary\xe2\x80\x9d expression, and certainly did not\r\nseem at all pleased to see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this place?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen-gardens,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, pointing through the other green door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another on t\xe2\x80\x99other side o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 wall\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 orchard t\xe2\x80\x99other side o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I go in them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf tha\xe2\x80\x99 likes. But there\xe2\x80\x99s nowt to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary made no response. She went down the path and through the second\r\ngreen door. There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass\r\nframes, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was\r\nnot open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten\r\nyears. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she\r\nwanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle. She\r\nhoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had\r\nfound the mysterious garden\xe2\x80\x94but it did open quite easily and she walked\r\nthrough it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all round\r\nit also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees\r\ngrowing in the winter-browned grass\xe2\x80\x94but there was no green door to be\r\nseen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the\r\nupper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to\r\nend with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place\r\nat the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and\r\nwhen she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on\r\nthe topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his\r\nwinter song\xe2\x80\x94almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly\r\nlittle whistle gave her a pleased feeling\xe2\x80\x94even a disagreeable little\r\ngirl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big\r\nbare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the\r\nworld but herself. If she had been an affectionate child, who had been\r\nused to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though\r\nshe was \xe2\x80\x9cMistress Mary Quite Contrary\xe2\x80\x9d she was desolate, and the\r\nbright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face\r\nwhich was almost a smile. She listened to him until he flew away. He\r\nwas not like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she\r\nshould ever see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden\r\nand knew all about it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought\r\nso much of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted to\r\nsee what it was like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If\r\nhe had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden? She wondered\r\nif she should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should not\r\nlike him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand and\r\nstare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully\r\nto ask him why he had done such a queer thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople never like me and I never like people,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\nnever can talk as the Crawford children could. They were always talking\r\nand laughing and making noises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at\r\nher, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped\r\nrather suddenly on the path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that tree was in the secret garden\xe2\x80\x94I feel sure it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a wall round the place and there was no door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found\r\nthe old man digging there. She went and stood beside him and watched\r\nhim a few moments in her cold little way. He took no notice of her and\r\nso at last she spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been into the other gardens,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to prevent thee,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered crustily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went into the orchard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no dog at th\xe2\x80\x99 door to bite thee,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no door there into the other garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat garden?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one on the other side of the wall,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mistress Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare trees there\xe2\x80\x94I saw the tops of them. A bird with a red breast was\r\nsitting on one of them and he sang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its\r\nexpression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite\r\ndifferent. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a\r\nperson looked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.\r\n\r\nHe turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to\r\nwhistle\xe2\x80\x94a low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surly\r\nman could make such a coaxing sound.\r\n\r\nAlmost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard a soft\r\nlittle rushing flight through the air\xe2\x80\x94and it was the bird with the red\r\nbreast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of\r\nearth quite near to the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as if\r\nhe were speaking to a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere has tha\xe2\x80\x99 been, tha\xe2\x80\x99 cheeky little beggar?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not\r\nseen thee before today. Has tha begun tha\xe2\x80\x99 courtin\xe2\x80\x99 this early in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nseason? Tha\xe2\x80\x99rt too forrad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his\r\nsoft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite\r\nfamiliar and not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth\r\nbriskly, looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave Mary a queer\r\nfeeling in her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed\r\nso like a person. He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and\r\nslender delicate legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he always come when you call him?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that he will. I\xe2\x80\x99ve knowed him ever since he was a fledgling. He\r\ncome out of th\xe2\x80\x99 nest in th\xe2\x80\x99 other garden an\xe2\x80\x99 when first he flew over\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an\xe2\x80\x99 we got\r\nfriendly. When he went over th\xe2\x80\x99 wall again th\xe2\x80\x99 rest of th\xe2\x80\x99 brood was\r\ngone an\xe2\x80\x99 he was lonely an\xe2\x80\x99 he come back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a bird is he?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99 know? He\xe2\x80\x99s a robin redbreast an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re th\xe2\x80\x99 friendliest,\r\ncuriousest birds alive. They\xe2\x80\x99re almost as friendly as dogs\xe2\x80\x94if you know\r\nhow to get on with \xe2\x80\x99em. Watch him peckin\xe2\x80\x99 about there an\xe2\x80\x99 lookin\xe2\x80\x99 round\r\nat us now an\xe2\x80\x99 again. He knows we\xe2\x80\x99re talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow. He looked\r\nat the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud\r\nand fond of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a conceited one,\xe2\x80\x9d he chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe likes to hear folk talk about\r\nhim. An\xe2\x80\x99 curious\xe2\x80\x94bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmeddlin\xe2\x80\x99. He\xe2\x80\x99s always comin\xe2\x80\x99 to see what I\xe2\x80\x99m plantin\xe2\x80\x99. He knows all th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthings Mester Craven never troubles hissel\xe2\x80\x99 to find out. He\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 head\r\ngardener, he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped\r\nand looked at them a little. Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed\r\nat her with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding out\r\nall about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did the rest of the brood fly to?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no knowin\xe2\x80\x99. The old ones turn \xe2\x80\x99em out o\xe2\x80\x99 their nest an\xe2\x80\x99 make\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em fly an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re scattered before you know it. This one was a\r\nknowin\xe2\x80\x99 one an\xe2\x80\x99 he knew he was lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m lonely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe had not known before that this was one of the things which made her\r\nfeel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at\r\nher and she looked at the robin.\r\n\r\nThe old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her\r\na minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt tha\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 little wench from India?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMary nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen no wonder tha\xe2\x80\x99rt lonely. Tha\xe2\x80\x99lt be lonlier before tha\xe2\x80\x99s done,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black\r\ngarden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary inquired.\r\n\r\nHe stood up to answer her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBen Weatherstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, and then he added with a surly\r\nchuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m lonely mysel\xe2\x80\x99 except when he\xe2\x80\x99s with me,\xe2\x80\x9d and he jerked\r\nhis thumb toward the robin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 only friend I\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no friends at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI never had. My Ayah didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike me and I never played with anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and\r\nold Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 me are a good bit alike,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe was wove out of th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsame cloth. We\xe2\x80\x99re neither of us good lookin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99re both of us as\r\nsour as we look. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwarrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth\r\nabout herself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and\r\nsubmitted to you, whatever you did. She had never thought much about\r\nher looks, but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben\r\nWeatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had\r\nlooked before the robin came. She actually began to wonder also if she\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cnasty tempered.\xe2\x80\x9d She felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she\r\nturned round. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and\r\nthe robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a\r\nscrap of a song. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he do that for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s made up his mind to make friends with thee,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cDang\r\nme if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t took a fancy to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly and\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you make friends with me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the robin just as if she\r\nwas speaking to a person. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you?\xe2\x80\x9d And she did not say it either in\r\nher hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone\r\nso soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as\r\nshe had been when she heard him whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9ctha\xe2\x80\x99 said that as nice an\xe2\x80\x99 human as if tha\xe2\x80\x99 was a\r\nreal child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 said it almost like\r\nDickon talks to his wild things on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Dickon?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows him. Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s wanderin\xe2\x80\x99 about everywhere. Th\xe2\x80\x99 very\r\nblackberries an\xe2\x80\x99 heather-bells knows him. I warrant th\xe2\x80\x99 foxes shows him\r\nwhere their cubs lies an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 skylarks doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide their nests from\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary would have liked to ask some more questions. She was almost as\r\ncurious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden. But just\r\nthat moment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of\r\nhis wings, spread them and flew away. He had made his visit and had\r\nother things to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has flown over the wall!\xe2\x80\x9d Mary cried out, watching him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\nflown into the orchard\xe2\x80\x94he has flown across the other wall\xe2\x80\x94into the\r\ngarden where there is no door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives there,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cHe came out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 egg there. If he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourtin\xe2\x80\x99, he\xe2\x80\x99s makin\xe2\x80\x99 up to some young madam of a robin that lives\r\namong th\xe2\x80\x99 old rose-trees there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRose-trees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there rose-trees?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was ten year\xe2\x80\x99 ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the green door? There\r\nmust be a door somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked\r\nwhen she first saw him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was ten year\xe2\x80\x99 ago, but there isn\xe2\x80\x99t now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo door!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone as anyone can find, an\xe2\x80\x99 none as is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s business. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nbe a meddlesome wench an\xe2\x80\x99 poke your nose where it\xe2\x80\x99s no cause to go.\r\nHere, I must go on with my work. Get you gone an\xe2\x80\x99 play you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nmore time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and\r\nwalked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the\r\nothers. Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha\r\nkneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her\r\nbreakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after\r\neach breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor\r\nwhich seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and\r\nafter she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go\r\nout she would have to stay in and do nothing\xe2\x80\x94and so she went out. She\r\ndid not know that this was the best thing she could have done, and she\r\ndid not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the\r\npaths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making\r\nherself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the\r\nmoor. She ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which\r\nrushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some\r\ngiant she could not see. But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown\r\nover the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her\r\nwhole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and\r\nbrightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it.\r\n\r\nBut after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one\r\nmorning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her\r\nbreakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it\r\naway, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it\r\nuntil her bowl was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 got on well enough with that this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, didn\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMartha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt tastes nice today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, feeling a little surprised herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 air of th\xe2\x80\x99 moor that\xe2\x80\x99s givin\xe2\x80\x99 thee stomach for tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvictuals,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for thee that tha\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nvictuals as well as appetite. There\xe2\x80\x99s been twelve in our cottage as had\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 stomach an\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to put in it. You go on playin\xe2\x80\x99 you out o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoors every day an\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ll get some flesh on your bones an\xe2\x80\x99 you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe so yeller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to play with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothin\xe2\x80\x99 to play with!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cOur children plays with\r\nsticks and stones. They just runs about an\xe2\x80\x99 shouts an\xe2\x80\x99 looks at\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was\r\nnothing else to do. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered\r\nabout the paths in the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff,\r\nbut though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at\r\nher or was too surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up\r\nhis spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose.\r\n\r\nOne place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk\r\noutside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bare\r\nflower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew\r\nthickly. There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green\r\nleaves were more bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time\r\nthat part had been neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made\r\nto look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nA few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to\r\nnotice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and was\r\nlooking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a\r\ngleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of\r\nthe wall, perched Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s robin redbreast, tilting forward\r\nto look at her with his small head on one side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cis it you\xe2\x80\x94is it you?\xe2\x80\x9d And it did not seem at all\r\nqueer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure that he would\r\nunderstand and answer her.\r\n\r\nHe did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if\r\nhe were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary as\r\nif she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It was\r\nas if he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the wind nice? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sun nice? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neverything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on! Come\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the\r\nwall she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nactually looked almost pretty for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you! I like you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, pattering down the walk; and\r\nshe chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do\r\nin the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped\r\nand whistled back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a\r\ndarting flight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.\r\n\r\nThat reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had been\r\nswinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard.\r\nNow she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path\r\noutside a wall\xe2\x80\x94much lower down\xe2\x80\x94and there was the same tree inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the garden no one can go into,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ngarden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what\r\nit is like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first\r\nmorning. Then she ran down the path through the other door and then\r\ninto the orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree\r\non the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing\r\nhis song and beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall,\r\nbut she only found what she had found before\xe2\x80\x94that there was no door in\r\nit. Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the\r\nwalk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it\r\nand looked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the\r\nother end, looking again, but there was no door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very queer,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBen Weatherstaff said there was no door\r\nand there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago,\r\nbecause Mr. Craven buried the key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested\r\nand feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite\r\nManor. In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care much\r\nabout anything. The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had\r\nbegun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nShe stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her\r\nsupper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not\r\nfeel cross when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked\r\nto hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. She\r\nasked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the\r\nhearth-rug before the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did Mr. Craven hate the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.\r\nShe was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and\r\nsisters, and she found it dull in the great servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall downstairs\r\nwhere the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech\r\nand looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered\r\namong themselves. Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had\r\nlived in India, and been waited upon by \xe2\x80\x9cblacks,\xe2\x80\x9d was novelty enough to\r\nattract her.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt tha\xe2\x80\x99 thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 about that garden yet?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwould. That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he hate it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary persisted.\r\n\r\nMartha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to th\xe2\x80\x99 wind wutherin\xe2\x80\x99 round the house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could\r\nbare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary did not know what \xe2\x80\x9cwutherin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d meant until she listened, and then\r\nshe understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which\r\nrushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were\r\nbuffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.\r\nBut one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very\r\nsafe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did he hate it so?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, after she had listened. She\r\nintended to know if Martha did.\r\n\r\nThen Martha gave up her store of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Medlock said it\xe2\x80\x99s not to be talked about.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots o\xe2\x80\x99 things in this place that\xe2\x80\x99s not to be talked over.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Craven\xe2\x80\x99s orders. His troubles are none servants\xe2\x80\x99 business,\r\nhe says. But for th\xe2\x80\x99 garden he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be like he is. It was Mrs.\r\nCraven\xe2\x80\x99s garden that she had made when first they were married an\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\njust loved it, an\xe2\x80\x99 they used to \xe2\x80\x99tend the flowers themselves. An\xe2\x80\x99 none\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an\xe2\x80\x99 her used to go in an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshut th\xe2\x80\x99 door an\xe2\x80\x99 stay there hours an\xe2\x80\x99 hours, readin\xe2\x80\x99 and talkin\xe2\x80\x99. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe was just a bit of a girl an\xe2\x80\x99 there was an old tree with a branch\r\nbent like a seat on it. An\xe2\x80\x99 she made roses grow over it an\xe2\x80\x99 she used to\r\nsit there. But one day when she was sittin\xe2\x80\x99 there th\xe2\x80\x99 branch broke an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe fell on th\xe2\x80\x99 ground an\xe2\x80\x99 was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoctors thought he\xe2\x80\x99d go out o\xe2\x80\x99 his mind an\xe2\x80\x99 die, too. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\r\nhates it. No one\xe2\x80\x99s never gone in since, an\xe2\x80\x99 he won\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone talk\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire and\r\nlistened to the wind \xe2\x80\x9cwutherin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to be \xe2\x80\x9cwutherin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d louder\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good things\r\nhad happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor.\r\nShe had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had\r\nunderstood her; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm;\r\nshe had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she\r\nhad found out what it was to be sorry for someone.\r\n\r\nBut as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something\r\nelse. She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely\r\ndistinguish it from the wind itself. It was a curious sound\xe2\x80\x94it seemed\r\nalmost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind sounded\r\nrather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure\r\nthis sound was inside the house, not outside it. It was far away, but\r\nit was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear anyone crying?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMartha suddenly looked confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if\r\nsomeone was lost on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor an\xe2\x80\x99 wailin\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s got all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut listen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the house\xe2\x80\x94down one of those long\r\ncorridors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere\r\ndownstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the\r\ndoor of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they\r\nboth jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound\r\nwas swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so! It is someone crying\xe2\x80\x94and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ngrown-up person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it\r\nthey both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a\r\nbang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwutherin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was th\xe2\x80\x99 wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha stubbornly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, it was\r\nlittle Betty Butterworth, th\xe2\x80\x99 scullery-maid. She\xe2\x80\x99s had th\xe2\x80\x99 toothache\r\nall day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Mary\r\nstare very hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHERE WAS SOMEONE CRYING\xe2\x80\x94THERE WAS!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary\r\nlooked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and\r\ncloud. There could be no going out today.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nMartha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to keep from under each other\xe2\x80\x99s feet mostly,\xe2\x80\x9d Martha answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! there does seem a lot of us then. Mother\xe2\x80\x99s a good-tempered woman\r\nbut she gets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th\xe2\x80\x99 cow-shed\r\nand plays there. Dickon he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind th\xe2\x80\x99 wet. He goes out just th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsame as if th\xe2\x80\x99 sun was shinin\xe2\x80\x99. He says he sees things on rainy days as\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t show when it\xe2\x80\x99s fair weather. He once found a little fox cub\r\nhalf drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th\xe2\x80\x99 bosom of his\r\nshirt to keep it warm. Its mother had been killed nearby an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 hole\r\nwas swum out an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 rest o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 litter was dead. He\xe2\x80\x99s got it at home\r\nnow. He found a half-drowned young crow another time an\xe2\x80\x99 he brought it\r\nhome, too, an\xe2\x80\x99 tamed it. It\xe2\x80\x99s named Soot because it\xe2\x80\x99s so black, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\r\nhops an\xe2\x80\x99 flies about with him everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha\xe2\x80\x99s familiar\r\ntalk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when\r\nshe stopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah\r\nwhen she lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell\r\nabout the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four\r\nlittle rooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to\r\ntumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured\r\ncollie puppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When\r\nMartha told stories of what \xe2\x80\x9cmother\xe2\x80\x9d said or did they always sounded\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nhave nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan tha\xe2\x80\x99 knit?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan tha\xe2\x80\x99 sew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan tha\xe2\x80\x99 read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tha read somethin\xe2\x80\x99, or learn a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 spellin\xe2\x80\x99?\r\nTha\xe2\x80\x99st old enough to be learnin\xe2\x80\x99 thy book a good bit now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t any books,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThose I had were left in India.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mrs. Medlock\xe2\x80\x99d let thee go into th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlibrary, there\xe2\x80\x99s thousands o\xe2\x80\x99 books there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly\r\ninspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself.\r\nShe was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to\r\nbe in her comfortable housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room downstairs. In this\r\nqueer place one scarcely ever saw anyone at all. In fact, there was no\r\none to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived\r\na luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung\r\nabout with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall where\r\nthere were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a\r\ngreat deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no\r\none troubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and\r\nlooked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or\r\ntold her what to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way\r\nof treating children. In India she had always been attended by her\r\nAyah, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She\r\nhad often been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and\r\nwas learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she\r\nthought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed\r\nto her and put on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99 got good sense?\xe2\x80\x9d she said once, when Mary had stood\r\nwaiting for her to put on her gloves for her. \xe2\x80\x9cOur Susan Ann is twice\r\nas sharp as thee an\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99s only four year\xe2\x80\x99 old. Sometimes tha\xe2\x80\x99 looks\r\nfair soft in th\xe2\x80\x99 head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made\r\nher think several entirely new things.\r\n\r\nShe stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha\r\nhad swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs. She was\r\nthinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the\r\nlibrary. She did not care very much about the library itself, because\r\nshe had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind\r\nthe hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were all\r\nreally locked and what she would find if she could get into any of\r\nthem. Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she go and see how\r\nmany doors she could count? It would be something to do on this morning\r\nwhen she could not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission\r\nto do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would\r\nnot have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk\r\nabout the house, even if she had seen her.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then\r\nshe began her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into\r\nother corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted\r\nto others again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on\r\nthe walls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes,\r\nbut oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand\r\ncostumes made of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long\r\ngallery whose walls were covered with these portraits. She had never\r\nthought there could be so many in any house. She walked slowly down\r\nthis place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her.\r\nShe felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was\r\ndoing in their house. Some were pictures of children\xe2\x80\x94little girls in\r\nthick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about\r\nthem, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or\r\nwith big ruffs around their necks. She always stopped to look at the\r\nchildren, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone,\r\nand why they wore such odd clothes. There was a stiff, plain little\r\ngirl rather like herself. She wore a green brocade dress and held a\r\ngreen parrot on her finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary aloud to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemed\r\nas if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small\r\nself, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and\r\nwide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever\r\nwalked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in\r\nthem, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIt was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of\r\nturning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock\r\nhad said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one\r\nof them and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she\r\nfelt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon\r\nthe door itself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and\r\nopened into a big bedroom. There were embroidered hangings on the wall,\r\nand inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the\r\nroom. A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and\r\nover the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl\r\nwho seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she slept here once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cShe stares at me so that she\r\nmakes me feel queer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms that\r\nshe became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred,\r\nthough she had not counted them. In all of them there were old pictures\r\nor old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were\r\ncurious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn one room, which looked like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, the hangings were\r\nall embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little\r\nelephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some had\r\ntheir mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger than\r\nthe others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary had\r\nseen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She opened\r\nthe door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these\r\nfor quite a long time. When she got tired she set the elephants in\r\norder and shut the door of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms,\r\nshe had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Just\r\nafter she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.\r\nIt made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from\r\nwhich it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion,\r\nand in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the\r\nhole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.\r\n\r\nMary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to\r\na little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion\r\nand made a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep\r\nnear her. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there\r\nwere seven mice who did not look lonely at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so frightened I would take them back with me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mary.\r\n\r\nShe had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any\r\nfarther, and she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way by\r\nturning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down\r\nuntil she found the right one; but at last she reached her own floor\r\nagain, though she was some distance from her own room and did not know\r\nexactly where she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I have taken a wrong turning again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, standing\r\nstill at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the\r\nwall. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know which way to go. How still everything is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was while she was standing here and just after she had said this\r\nthat the stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not\r\nquite like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a\r\nfretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nearer than it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, her heart beating rather faster.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it _is_ crying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then\r\nsprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of a\r\ndoor which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the\r\ncorridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of\r\nkeys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and she took Mary by the arm and\r\npulled her away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned round the wrong corner,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which\r\nway to go and I heard someone crying.\xe2\x80\x9d She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at\r\nthe moment, but she hated her more the next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said the housekeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come\r\nalong back to your own nursery or I\xe2\x80\x99ll box your ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one\r\npassage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou stay where you\xe2\x80\x99re told to stay or you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nyourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same as\r\nhe said he would. You\xe2\x80\x99re one that needs someone to look sharp after\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary went\r\nand sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but ground\r\nher teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _was_ someone crying\xe2\x80\x94there _was_\xe2\x80\x94there _was!_\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She had\r\nfound out a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on a\r\nlong journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all\r\nthe time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the\r\ngray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE KEY TO THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed\r\nimmediately, and called to Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the moor! Look at the moor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept\r\naway in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a\r\nbrilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never\r\nhad Mary dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing;\r\nthis was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the\r\nwaters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high\r\nin the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. The\r\nfar-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of\r\ngloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha with a cheerful grin. \xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 storm\xe2\x80\x99s over for a bit.\r\nIt does like this at this time o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 year. It goes off in a night like\r\nit was pretendin\xe2\x80\x99 it had never been here an\xe2\x80\x99 never meant to come again.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because th\xe2\x80\x99 springtime\xe2\x80\x99s on its way. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long way off yet,\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s comin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead\r\nbrushes. \xe2\x80\x9cNowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 soart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary seriously. In India the natives spoke\r\ndifferent dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not\r\nsurprised when Martha used words she did not know.\r\n\r\nMartha laughed as she had done the first morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs.\r\nMedlock said I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98Nowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 soart\xe2\x80\x99 means\r\n\xe2\x80\x98nothin\xe2\x80\x99-of-the-sort,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d slowly and carefully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it takes so long to\r\nsay it. Yorkshire\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I\r\ntold thee tha\xe2\x80\x99d like th\xe2\x80\x99 moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 gold-colored gorse blossoms an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 blossoms o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 broom, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nheather flowerin\xe2\x80\x99, all purple bells, an\xe2\x80\x99 hundreds o\xe2\x80\x99 butterflies\r\nflutterin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 bees hummin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 skylarks soarin\xe2\x80\x99 up an\xe2\x80\x99 singin\xe2\x80\x99. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwant to get out on it at sunrise an\xe2\x80\x99 live out on it all day like Dickon\r\ndoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I ever get there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary wistfully, looking through her\r\nwindow at the far-off blue. It was so new and big and wonderful and\r\nsuch a heavenly color.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s never used tha\xe2\x80\x99 legs since tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwas born, it seems to me. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk five mile. It\xe2\x80\x99s five mile\r\nto our cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see your cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her\r\npolishing brush and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that\r\nthe small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it\r\nhad done the first morning she saw it. It looked just a trifle like\r\nlittle Susan Ann\xe2\x80\x99s when she wanted something very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask my mother about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s one o\xe2\x80\x99 them that nearly\r\nalways sees a way to do things. It\xe2\x80\x99s my day out today an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhome. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 mother. Perhaps she\r\ncould talk to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think tha\xe2\x80\x99 did,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Martha, polishing away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, tha\xe2\x80\x99 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Martha.\r\n\r\nShe sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the\r\nback of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite\r\npositively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s that sensible an\xe2\x80\x99 hard workin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 good-natured an\xe2\x80\x99 clean\r\nthat no one could help likin\xe2\x80\x99 her whether they\xe2\x80\x99d seen her or not. When\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncrossin\xe2\x80\x99 the moor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha stoutly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told thee that th\xe2\x80\x99 very birds likes\r\nhim an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 rabbits an\xe2\x80\x99 wild sheep an\xe2\x80\x99 ponies, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 foxes\r\nthemselves. I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d staring at her reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat Dickon would\r\nthink of thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary in her stiff, cold little way. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one\r\ndoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha looked reflective again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does tha\xe2\x80\x99 like thysel\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, really quite as if she were\r\ncurious to know.\r\n\r\nMary hesitated a moment and thought it over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all\xe2\x80\x94really,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I never thought of that\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother said that to me once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was at her wash-tub an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nwas in a bad temper an\xe2\x80\x99 talkin\xe2\x80\x99 ill of folk, an\xe2\x80\x99 she turns round on me\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 says: \xe2\x80\x98Tha\xe2\x80\x99 young vixen, tha\xe2\x80\x99! There tha\xe2\x80\x99 stands sayin\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like this one an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like that one. How does tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlike thysel\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99 It made me laugh an\xe2\x80\x99 it brought me to my senses in a\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her\r\nbreakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the\r\ncottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do\r\nthe week\xe2\x80\x99s baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.\r\n\r\nMary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the\r\nhouse. She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the\r\nfirst thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower\r\ngarden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when she had\r\nfinished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole place\r\nlook different. The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as\r\nwell as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up\r\ninto it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of\r\nthe little snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the first\r\nkitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other\r\ngardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. He\r\nspoke to her of his own accord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpringtime\xe2\x80\x99s comin,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCannot tha\xe2\x80\x99 smell it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary sniffed and thought she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI smell something nice and fresh and damp,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 good rich earth,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, digging away. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in a\r\ngood humor makin\xe2\x80\x99 ready to grow things. It\xe2\x80\x99s glad when plantin\xe2\x80\x99 time\r\ncomes. It\xe2\x80\x99s dull in th\xe2\x80\x99 winter when it\xe2\x80\x99s got nowt to do. In th\xe2\x80\x99 flower\r\ngardens out there things will be stirrin\xe2\x80\x99 down below in th\xe2\x80\x99 dark. Th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsun\xe2\x80\x99s warmin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see bits o\xe2\x80\x99 green spikes stickin\xe2\x80\x99 out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nblack earth after a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will they be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrocuses an\xe2\x80\x99 snowdrops an\xe2\x80\x99 daffydowndillys. Has tha\xe2\x80\x99 never seen them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think things grow up in a night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese won\xe2\x80\x99t grow up in a night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Weatherstaff. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\nwait for \xe2\x80\x99em. They\xe2\x80\x99ll poke up a bit higher here, an\xe2\x80\x99 push out a spike\r\nmore there, an\xe2\x80\x99 uncurl a leaf this day an\xe2\x80\x99 another that. You watch\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary.\r\n\r\nVery soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she\r\nknew at once that the robin had come again. He was very pert and\r\nlively, and hopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one\r\nside and looked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he remembers me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemembers thee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Weatherstaff indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows every\r\ncabbage stump in th\xe2\x80\x99 gardens, let alone th\xe2\x80\x99 people. He\xe2\x80\x99s never seen a\r\nlittle wench here before, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s bent on findin\xe2\x80\x99 out all about thee.\r\nTha\xe2\x80\x99s no need to try to hide anything from _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he\r\nlives?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat garden?\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one where the old rose-trees are.\xe2\x80\x9d She could not help asking,\r\nbecause she wanted so much to know. \xe2\x80\x9cAre all the flowers dead, or do\r\nsome of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the\r\nrobin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it for\r\nten year\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen years was a long time, Mary thought. She had been born ten years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nShe walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the garden just\r\nas she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha\xe2\x80\x99s mother. She\r\nwas beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as one\r\nof the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall\r\nover which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked\r\nup and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her,\r\nand it was all through Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s robin.\r\n\r\nShe heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare\r\nflower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending\r\nto peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not\r\nfollowed her. But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so\r\nfilled her with delight that she almost trembled a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do remember me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do! You are prettier than\r\nanything else in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail\r\nand twittered. It was as if he were talking. His red waistcoat was like\r\nsatin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand\r\nand so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how\r\nimportant and like a human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary\r\nforgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her\r\nto draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to\r\nmake something like robin sounds.\r\n\r\nOh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as\r\nthat! He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand\r\ntoward him or startle him in the least tiniest way. He knew it because\r\nhe was a real person\xe2\x80\x94only nicer than any other person in the world. She\r\nwas so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because the\r\nperennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there\r\nwere tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the\r\nbed, and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a\r\nsmall pile of freshly turned up earth. He stopped on it to look for a\r\nworm. The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig\r\nup a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.\r\n\r\nMary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as\r\nshe looked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It\r\nwas something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin\r\nflew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up.\r\nIt was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if\r\nit had been buried a long time.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face\r\nas it hung from her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it has been buried for ten years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is the key to the garden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over,\r\nand thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who\r\nhad been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things.\r\nAll she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed\r\ngarden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhaps\r\nopen it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the\r\nold rose-trees. It was because it had been shut up so long that she\r\nwanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other\r\nplaces and that something strange must have happened to it during ten\r\nyears. Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and\r\nshut the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own\r\nand play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was,\r\nbut would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the\r\nearth. The thought of that pleased her very much.\r\n\r\nLiving as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred\r\nmysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse\r\nherself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually\r\nawakening her imagination. There is no doubt that the fresh, strong,\r\npure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it had\r\ngiven her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her\r\nblood, so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always\r\nbeen too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in\r\nthis place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things.\r\nAlready she felt less \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary,\xe2\x80\x9d though she did not know why.\r\n\r\nShe put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No one\r\nbut herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and\r\nlook at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the\r\nbaffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing\r\nbut thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much\r\ndisappointed. Something of her contrariness came back to her as she\r\npaced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so\r\nsilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.\r\nShe took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she\r\nmade up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went\r\nout, so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be\r\nready.\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but\r\nshe was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever\r\nand in the best of spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got up at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! it was pretty on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor\r\nwith th\xe2\x80\x99 birds gettin\xe2\x80\x99 up an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 rabbits scamperin\xe2\x80\x99 about an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 sun\r\nrisin\xe2\x80\x99. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t walk all th\xe2\x80\x99 way. A man gave me a ride in his cart an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI did enjoy myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was full of stories of the delights of her day out. Her mother had\r\nbeen glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of\r\nthe way. She had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit\r\nof brown sugar in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had \xe2\x80\x99em all pipin\xe2\x80\x99 hot when they came in from playin\xe2\x80\x99 on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 cottage all smelt o\xe2\x80\x99 nice, clean hot bakin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 there was a\r\ngood fire, an\xe2\x80\x99 they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he said our\r\ncottage was good enough for a king to live in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her\r\nmother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and\r\nMartha had told them about the little girl who had come from India and\r\nwho had been waited on all her life by what Martha called \xe2\x80\x9cblacks\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nuntil she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to put on her own stockings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! they did like to hear about you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted to\r\nknow all about th\xe2\x80\x99 blacks an\xe2\x80\x99 about th\xe2\x80\x99 ship you came in. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x99em enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary reflected a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso that you will have more to talk about. I dare say they would like\r\nto hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers\r\ngoing to hunt tigers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d cried delighted Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would set \xe2\x80\x99em clean off their\r\nheads. Would tha\xe2\x80\x99 really do that, Miss? It would be same as a wild\r\nbeast show like we heard they had in York once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndia is quite different from Yorkshire,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said slowly, as she\r\nthought the matter over. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of that. Did Dickon and your\r\nmother like to hear you talk about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, our Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes nearly started out o\xe2\x80\x99 his head, they got that\r\nround,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cBut mother, she was put out about your\r\nseemin\xe2\x80\x99 to be all by yourself like. She said, \xe2\x80\x98Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Craven got no\r\ngoverness for her, nor no nurse?\xe2\x80\x99 and I said, \xe2\x80\x98No, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, though\r\nMrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of it for two or three years.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want a governess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut mother says you ought to be learnin\xe2\x80\x99 your book by this time an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou ought to have a woman to look after you, an\xe2\x80\x99 she says: \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nMartha, you just think how you\xe2\x80\x99d feel yourself, in a big place like\r\nthat, wanderin\xe2\x80\x99 about all alone, an\xe2\x80\x99 no mother. You do your best to\r\ncheer her up,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, an\xe2\x80\x99 I said I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary gave her a long, steady look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do cheer me up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI like to hear you talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held\r\nin her hands under her apron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does tha\xe2\x80\x99 think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a cheerful grin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought\r\nthee a present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA present!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full of\r\nfourteen hungry people give anyone a present!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man was drivin\xe2\x80\x99 across the moor peddlin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Martha explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nstopped his cart at our door. He had pots an\xe2\x80\x99 pans an\xe2\x80\x99 odds an\xe2\x80\x99 ends,\r\nbut mother had no money to buy anythin\xe2\x80\x99. Just as he was goin\xe2\x80\x99 away our\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Lizabeth Ellen called out, \xe2\x80\x98Mother, he\xe2\x80\x99s got skippin\xe2\x80\x99-ropes with red\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 blue handles.\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 mother she calls out quite sudden, \xe2\x80\x98Here, stop,\r\nmister! How much are they?\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 he says \xe2\x80\x98Tuppence\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 mother she\r\nbegan fumblin\xe2\x80\x99 in her pocket an\xe2\x80\x99 she says to me, \xe2\x80\x98Martha, tha\xe2\x80\x99s brought\r\nme thy wages like a good lass, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got four places to put every\r\npenny, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just goin\xe2\x80\x99 to take tuppence out of it to buy that child\r\na skippin\xe2\x80\x99-rope,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 she bought one an\xe2\x80\x99 here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly.\r\nIt was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at\r\neach end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She\r\ngazed at it with a mystified expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried out Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes tha\xe2\x80\x99 mean that they\xe2\x80\x99ve not got\r\nskippin\xe2\x80\x99-ropes in India, for all they\xe2\x80\x99ve got elephants and tigers and\r\ncamels! No wonder most of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99s black. This is what it\xe2\x80\x99s for; just\r\nwatch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each\r\nhand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair\r\nto stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to\r\nstare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager\r\nhad the impudence to be doing under their very noses. But Martha did\r\nnot even see them. The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\ndelighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped\r\nuntil she had reached a hundred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could skip longer than that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when she stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nskipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as fat\r\nthen as I am now, an\xe2\x80\x99 I was in practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother is a kind woman. Do you think I\r\ncould ever skip like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just try it,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t skip a hundred at first, but if you practice you\xe2\x80\x99ll mount up.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what mother said. She says, \xe2\x80\x98Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 will do her more good than\r\nskippin\xe2\x80\x99 rope. It\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her play\r\nout in th\xe2\x80\x99 fresh air skippin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99ll stretch her legs an\xe2\x80\x99 arms an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngive her some strength in \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s arms and legs when she first began to skip. She was not very\r\nclever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut on tha\xe2\x80\x99 things and run an\xe2\x80\x99 skip out o\xe2\x80\x99 doors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother said I must tell you to keep out o\xe2\x80\x99 doors as much as you could,\r\neven when it rains a bit, so as tha\xe2\x80\x99 wrap up warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm.\r\nShe opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something\r\nand turned back rather slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartha,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey were your wages. It was your two-pence\r\nreally. Thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d She said it stiffly because she was not used to\r\nthanking people or noticing that they did things for her. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, and held out her hand because she did not know what else to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nMartha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not\r\naccustomed to this sort of thing either. Then she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! th\xe2\x80\x99 art a queer, old-womanish thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf tha\xe2\x80\x99d been our\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Lizabeth Ellen tha\xe2\x80\x99d have given me a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary looked stiffer than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to kiss you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, not me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf tha\xe2\x80\x99 was different, p\xe2\x80\x99raps tha\xe2\x80\x99d want\r\nto thysel\xe2\x80\x99. But tha\xe2\x80\x99 isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Run off outside an\xe2\x80\x99 play with thy rope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room.\r\nYorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle\r\nto her. At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not.\r\nThe skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She counted and skipped, and\r\nskipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was more\r\ninterested than she had ever been since she was born. The sun was\r\nshining and a little wind was blowing\xe2\x80\x94not a rough wind, but one which\r\ncame in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly\r\nturned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one\r\nwalk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and\r\nsaw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was\r\nhopping about him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted\r\nhis head and looked at her with a curious expression. She had wondered\r\nif he would notice her. She wanted him to see her skip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word. P\xe2\x80\x99raps tha\xe2\x80\x99 art a young \xe2\x80\x99un, after\r\nall, an\xe2\x80\x99 p\xe2\x80\x99raps tha\xe2\x80\x99s got child\xe2\x80\x99s blood in thy veins instead of sour\r\nbuttermilk. Tha\xe2\x80\x99s skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name\xe2\x80\x99s Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed tha\xe2\x80\x99 could do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never skipped before,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just beginning. I can only go\r\nup to twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 keep on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 shapes well enough at it for a young\r\n\xe2\x80\x99un that\xe2\x80\x99s lived with heathen. Just see how he\xe2\x80\x99s watchin\xe2\x80\x99 thee,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\njerking his head toward the robin. \xe2\x80\x9cHe followed after thee yesterday.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be at it again today. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound to find out what th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nskippin\xe2\x80\x99-rope is. He\xe2\x80\x99s never seen one. Eh!\xe2\x80\x9d shaking his head at the\r\nbird, \xe2\x80\x9ctha\xe2\x80\x99 curiosity will be th\xe2\x80\x99 death of thee sometime if tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t look sharp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every\r\nfew minutes. At length she went to her own special walk and made up her\r\nmind to try if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good\r\nlong skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down\r\nthe path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop.\r\nShe did not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty.\r\nShe stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold,\r\nwas the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and\r\nhe greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she felt\r\nsomething heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when\r\nshe saw the robin she laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou showed me where the key was yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to\r\nshow me the door today; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall\r\nand he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show\r\noff. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when\r\nhe shows off\xe2\x80\x94and they are nearly always doing it.\r\n\r\nMary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah\xe2\x80\x99s stories,\r\nand she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.\r\n\r\nOne of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a\r\nstronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches\r\nof the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing\r\nsprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close\r\nto the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy\r\ntrails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in\r\nher hand. This she did because she had seen something under it\xe2\x80\x94a round\r\nknob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it. It was the\r\nknob of a door.\r\n\r\nShe put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them\r\naside. Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging\r\ncurtain, though some had crept over wood and iron. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s heart began\r\nto thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement.\r\nThe robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one\r\nside, as if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her\r\nhands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a\r\nhole in?\r\n\r\nIt was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put\r\nher hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the\r\nkeyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it,\r\nbut it did turn.\r\n\r\nAnd then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk\r\nto see if anyone was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come,\r\nit seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not help\r\nit, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the\r\ndoor which opened slowly\xe2\x80\x94slowly.\r\n\r\nThen she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her\r\nback against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with\r\nexcitement, and wonder, and delight.\r\n\r\nShe was standing _inside_ the secret garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE STRANGEST HOUSE ANYONE EVER LIVED IN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place anyone could\r\nimagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless\r\nstems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted\r\ntogether. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great\r\nmany roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry\r\nbrown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes\r\nif they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had so\r\nspread their branches that they were like little trees. There were\r\nother trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place\r\nlook strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over\r\nthem and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains,\r\nand here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching\r\nbranch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges\r\nof themselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary\r\ndid not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or\r\nbrown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading\r\nover everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had\r\nfallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazy\r\ntangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had\r\nthought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left\r\nall by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other\r\nplace she had ever seen in her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow still it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who\r\nhad flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even\r\nflutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder it is still,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered again. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the first person\r\nwho has spoken in here for ten years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid\r\nof awakening someone. She was glad that there was grass under her feet\r\nand that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the\r\nfairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays\r\nand tendrils which formed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if they are all quite dead,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it all a quite\r\ndead garden? I wish it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood\r\nwas alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only\r\ngray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a\r\ntiny leaf-bud anywhere.\r\n\r\nBut she was _inside_ the wonderful garden and she could come through\r\nthe door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a\r\nworld all her own.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky\r\nover this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant\r\nand soft than it was over the moor. The robin flew down from his\r\ntree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another.\r\nHe chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing\r\nher things. Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be\r\nhundreds of miles away from anyone, but somehow she did not feel lonely\r\nat all. All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all\r\nthe roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put\r\nout leaves and buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to\r\nbe a quite dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful\r\nit would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!\r\n\r\nHer skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she\r\nhad walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole\r\ngarden, stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to\r\nhave been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there\r\nwere alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower\r\nurns in them.\r\n\r\nAs she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping.\r\nThere had once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw\r\nsomething sticking out of the black earth\xe2\x80\x94some sharp little pale green\r\npoints. She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt\r\ndown to look at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are tiny growing things and they _might_ be crocuses or\r\nsnowdrops or daffodils,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nShe bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp\r\nearth. She liked it very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go all over the garden and look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on the\r\nground. She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and\r\nafter she had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so\r\nmany more sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a quite dead garden,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out softly to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cEven\r\nif the roses are dead, there are other things alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so\r\nthick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their\r\nway through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to\r\ngrow. She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood\r\nand knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she\r\nmade nice little clear places around them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow they look as if they could breathe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after she had\r\nfinished with the first ones. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to do ever so many more. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo all I can see. If I haven\xe2\x80\x99t time today I can come tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself\r\nso immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass\r\nunder the trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her\r\ncoat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down\r\non to the grass and the pale green points all the time.\r\n\r\nThe robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to see\r\ngardening begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to\r\neat are turned up with the soil. Now here was this new kind of creature\r\nwho was not half Ben\xe2\x80\x99s size and yet had had the sense to come into his\r\ngarden and begin at once.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her\r\nmidday dinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when\r\nshe put on her coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could\r\nnot believe that she had been working two or three hours. She had been\r\nactually happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale\r\ngreen points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as\r\ncheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been\r\nsmothering them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come back this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking all round at her\r\nnew kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they\r\nheard her.\r\n\r\nThen she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door\r\nand slipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and such\r\nbright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo pieces o\xe2\x80\x99 meat an\xe2\x80\x99 two helps o\xe2\x80\x99 rice puddin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cEh!\r\nmother will be pleased when I tell her what th\xe2\x80\x99 skippin\xe2\x80\x99-rope\xe2\x80\x99s done\r\nfor thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had\r\nfound herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. She\r\nhad put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it\r\nand just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartha,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are those white roots that look like onions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re bulbs,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cLots o\xe2\x80\x99 spring flowers grow from\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. Th\xe2\x80\x99 very little ones are snowdrops an\xe2\x80\x99 crocuses an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 big ones\r\nare narcissuses an\xe2\x80\x99 jonquils and daffydowndillys. Th\xe2\x80\x99 biggest of all is\r\nlilies an\xe2\x80\x99 purple flags. Eh! they are nice. Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s got a whole lot of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em planted in our bit o\xe2\x80\x99 garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Dickon know all about them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary, a new idea taking\r\npossession of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says he\r\njust whispers things out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no one\r\nhelped them?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mary anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re things as helps themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why poor\r\nfolk can afford to have \xe2\x80\x99em. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble \xe2\x80\x99em, most of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwork away underground for a lifetime an\xe2\x80\x99 spread out an\xe2\x80\x99 have little\r\n\xe2\x80\x99uns. There\xe2\x80\x99s a place in th\xe2\x80\x99 park woods here where there\xe2\x80\x99s snowdrops by\r\nthousands. They\xe2\x80\x99re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th\xe2\x80\x99 spring\r\ncomes. No one knows when they was first planted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish the spring was here now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see all the\r\nthings that grow in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the\r\nhearth-rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish\xe2\x80\x94I wish I had a little spade,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever does tha\xe2\x80\x99 want a spade for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Martha, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cArt\r\ntha\xe2\x80\x99 goin\xe2\x80\x99 to take to diggin\xe2\x80\x99? I must tell mother that, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful if\r\nshe meant to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing any harm, but if\r\nMr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry\r\nand get a new key and lock it up forevermore. She really could not bear\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is such a big lonely place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly, as if she were\r\nturning matters over in her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThe house is lonely, and the park is\r\nlonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I\r\nnever did many things in India, but there were more people to look\r\nat\xe2\x80\x94natives and soldiers marching by\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes bands playing, and my\r\nAyah told me stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and\r\nBen Weatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me often. I thought if I had a little spade I could dig\r\nsomewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would give\r\nme some seeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha\xe2\x80\x99s face quite lighted up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cif that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one of th\xe2\x80\x99 things mother\r\nsaid. She says, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s such a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 room in that big place, why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t they give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plant\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 but parsley an\xe2\x80\x99 radishes? She\xe2\x80\x99d dig an\xe2\x80\x99 rake away an\xe2\x80\x99 be right\r\ndown happy over it.\xe2\x80\x99 Them was the very words she said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many things she knows, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like she says: \xe2\x80\x98A woman as brings up twelve\r\nchildren learns something besides her A B C. Children\xe2\x80\x99s as good as\r\n\xe2\x80\x99rithmetic to set you findin\xe2\x80\x99 out things.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much would a spade cost\xe2\x80\x94a little one?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d was Martha\xe2\x80\x99s reflective answer, \xe2\x80\x9cat Thwaite village there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nshop or so an\xe2\x80\x99 I saw little garden sets with a spade an\xe2\x80\x99 a rake an\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nfork all tied together for two shillings. An\xe2\x80\x99 they was stout enough to\r\nwork with, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got more than that in my purse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Morrison gave\r\nme five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he remember thee that much?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She gives\r\nme one every Saturday. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to spend it on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word! that\xe2\x80\x99s riches,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 can buy anything in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworld tha\xe2\x80\x99 wants. Th\xe2\x80\x99 rent of our cottage is only one an\xe2\x80\x99 threepence\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s like pullin\xe2\x80\x99 eye-teeth to get it. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve just thought of\r\nsomethin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d putting her hands on her hips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o\xe2\x80\x99 flower-seeds for a penny\r\neach, and our Dickon he knows which is th\xe2\x80\x99 prettiest ones an\xe2\x80\x99 how to\r\nmake \xe2\x80\x99em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th\xe2\x80\x99 fun of\r\nit. Does tha\xe2\x80\x99 know how to print letters?\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how to write,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary answered.\r\n\r\nMartha shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Dickon can only read printin\xe2\x80\x99. If tha\xe2\x80\x99 could print we could write\r\na letter to him an\xe2\x80\x99 ask him to go an\xe2\x80\x99 buy th\xe2\x80\x99 garden tools an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nseeds at th\xe2\x80\x99 same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you\xe2\x80\x99re a good girl!\xe2\x80\x9d Mary cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are, really! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nyou were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try. Let\xe2\x80\x99s ask Mrs.\r\nMedlock for a pen and ink and some paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got some of my own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought \xe2\x80\x99em so I could print\r\na bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her\r\nthin little hands together with sheer pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have a spade,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cI can make the earth nice and soft\r\nand dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be dead at all\xe2\x80\x94it will come alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned\r\nwith her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and\r\ncarry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she got into the\r\nkitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Mary\r\nwaited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back. Then it\r\nwas a serious piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been taught\r\nvery little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay\r\nwith her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that she\r\ncould print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictated\r\nto her:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My Dear Dickon:_\r\n\r\nThis comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present. Miss\r\nMary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her some\r\nflower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed. Pick the\r\nprettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before\r\nand lived in India which is different. Give my love to mother and\r\neveryone of you. Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my\r\nnext day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen\r\ngoing hunting lions and tigers.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYour loving sister,\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cMartha Ph\xc5\x93be Sowerby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll put the money in th\xe2\x80\x99 envelope an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get th\xe2\x80\x99 butcher boy to\r\ntake it in his cart. He\xe2\x80\x99s a great friend o\xe2\x80\x99 Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll bring \xe2\x80\x99em to you himself. He\xe2\x80\x99ll like to walk over this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I shall see him! I never thought I should\r\nsee Dickon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes tha\xe2\x80\x99 want to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Martha suddenly, for Mary had looked\r\nso pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved. I want to see him\r\nvery much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow to think,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cto think o\xe2\x80\x99 me forgettin\xe2\x80\x99 that there;\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 I thought I was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to tell you first thing this mornin\xe2\x80\x99. I asked\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94and she said she\xe2\x80\x99d ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mary began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be driven over to our\r\ncottage some day and have a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 mother\xe2\x80\x99s hot oat cake, an\xe2\x80\x99 butter,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 a glass o\xe2\x80\x99 milk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day.\r\nTo think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was\r\nblue! To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, quite\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy woman mother is and\r\nhow clean she keeps the cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary,\r\nthinking it over and liking the idea very much. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be\r\nlike the mothers in India.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by\r\nmaking her feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her until\r\ntea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little. But\r\njust before Martha went downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartha,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chas the scullery-maid had the toothache again\r\ntoday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha certainly started slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes thee ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door\r\nand walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard\r\nthat far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a wind today, so you see it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha restlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go walkin\xe2\x80\x99 about in\r\ncorridors an\xe2\x80\x99 listenin\xe2\x80\x99. Mr. Craven would be that there angry there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno knowin\xe2\x80\x99 what he\xe2\x80\x99d do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t listening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just waiting for you\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nheard it. That\xe2\x80\x99s three times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word! There\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Medlock\xe2\x80\x99s bell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha, and she almost ran\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the strangest house anyone ever lived in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary drowsily, as\r\nshe dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.\r\nFresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so\r\ncomfortably tired that she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nDICKON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden. The Secret\r\nGarden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked\r\nthe name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful\r\nold walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost like\r\nbeing shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she had\r\nread and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret\r\ngardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in them\r\nfor a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. She\r\nhad no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming\r\nwider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning\r\nto like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed\r\nit. She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a\r\nhundred. The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished.\r\nSuch nice clear places were made round them that they had all the\r\nbreathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it,\r\nthey began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The\r\nsun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it\r\ncould reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.\r\n\r\nMary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something\r\ninteresting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.\r\nShe worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more\r\npleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to\r\nher like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of the\r\nsprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They\r\nseemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found\r\ntiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth.\r\nThere were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csnowdrops by the thousands,\xe2\x80\x9d and about bulbs spreading and making new\r\nones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they\r\nhad spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long\r\nit would be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes she\r\nstopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would\r\nbe like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.\r\n\r\nDuring that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start up\r\nbeside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she\r\nwas afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her\r\ncoming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But,\r\nin fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first.\r\nPerhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his\r\nelderly company. Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He\r\ndid not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would\r\nhave spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old\r\nYorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be\r\nmerely commanded by them to do things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99rt like th\xe2\x80\x99 robin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her one morning when he lifted his\r\nhead and saw her standing by him. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knows when I shall see thee\r\nor which side tha\xe2\x80\x99ll come from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s friends with me now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s like him,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Ben Weatherstaff. \xe2\x80\x9cMakin\xe2\x80\x99 up to th\xe2\x80\x99 women\r\nfolk just for vanity an\xe2\x80\x99 flightiness. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nfor th\xe2\x80\x99 sake o\xe2\x80\x99 showin\xe2\x80\x99 off an\xe2\x80\x99 flirtin\xe2\x80\x99 his tail-feathers. He\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nfull o\xe2\x80\x99 pride as an egg\xe2\x80\x99s full o\xe2\x80\x99 meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual.\r\nHe stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while\r\nhe looked her over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long has tha\xe2\x80\x99 been here?\xe2\x80\x9d he jerked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s about a month,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s beginnin\xe2\x80\x99 to do Misselthwaite credit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s a bit\r\nfatter than tha\xe2\x80\x99 was an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99s not quite so yeller. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 looked like a\r\nyoung plucked crow when tha\xe2\x80\x99 first came into this garden. Thinks I to\r\nmyself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young \xe2\x80\x99un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she\r\nwas not greatly disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m fatter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy stockings are getting tighter. They\r\nused to make wrinkles. There\xe2\x80\x99s the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than\r\never. His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings\r\nand tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively\r\ngraces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. But\r\nBen was sarcastic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, there tha\xe2\x80\x99 art!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 can put up with me for a bit\r\nsometimes when tha\xe2\x80\x99s got no one better. Tha\xe2\x80\x99s been reddenin\xe2\x80\x99 up thy\r\nwaistcoat an\xe2\x80\x99 polishin\xe2\x80\x99 thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nup to. Tha\xe2\x80\x99s courtin\xe2\x80\x99 some bold young madam somewhere tellin\xe2\x80\x99 thy lies\r\nto her about bein\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 finest cock robin on Missel Moor an\xe2\x80\x99 ready to\r\nfight all th\xe2\x80\x99 rest of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! look at him!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mary.\r\n\r\nThe robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closer\r\nand closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. He\r\nflew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a\r\nlittle song right at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 thinks tha\xe2\x80\x99ll get over me by doin\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, wrinkling his\r\nface up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to look\r\npleased. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 thinks no one can stand out against thee\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\ntha\xe2\x80\x99 thinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe robin spread his wings\xe2\x80\x94Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. He\r\nflew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s spade and alighted on\r\nthe top of it. Then the old man\xe2\x80\x99s face wrinkled itself slowly into a\r\nnew expression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe\xe2\x80\x94as if he\r\nwould not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.\r\nHe spoke quite in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m danged!\xe2\x80\x9d he said as softly as if he were saying something\r\nquite different. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 does know how to get at a chap\xe2\x80\x94tha\xe2\x80\x99 does! Tha\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfair unearthly, tha\xe2\x80\x99s so knowin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he stood without stirring\xe2\x80\x94almost without drawing his breath\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nthe robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stood\r\nlooking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it,\r\nand then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.\r\n\r\nBut because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was\r\nnot afraid to talk to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a garden of your own?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m bachelder an\xe2\x80\x99 lodge with Martin at th\xe2\x80\x99 gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would you plant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCabbages an\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99taters an\xe2\x80\x99 onions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you wanted to make a flower garden,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nwould you plant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBulbs an\xe2\x80\x99 sweet-smellin\xe2\x80\x99 things\xe2\x80\x94but mostly roses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s face lighted up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like roses?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.\r\nShe had a lot in a place she was fond of, an\xe2\x80\x99 she loved \xe2\x80\x99em like they\r\nwas children\xe2\x80\x94or robins. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her bend over an\xe2\x80\x99 kiss \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndragged out another weed and scowled at it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat were as much as ten\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99 ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary, much interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99cording to what parson says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened to the roses?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked again, more interested than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey was left to themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was becoming quite excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to\r\nthemselves?\xe2\x80\x9d she ventured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99d got to like \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I liked her\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 she liked \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d Ben\r\nWeatherstaff admitted reluctantly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce or twice a year I\xe2\x80\x99d go an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwork at \xe2\x80\x99em a bit\xe2\x80\x94prune \xe2\x80\x99em an\xe2\x80\x99 dig about th\xe2\x80\x99 roots. They run wild, but\r\nthey was in rich soil, so some of \xe2\x80\x99em lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you\r\ntell whether they are dead or alive?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till th\xe2\x80\x99 spring gets at \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94wait till th\xe2\x80\x99 sun shines on th\xe2\x80\x99 rain\r\nand th\xe2\x80\x99 rain falls on th\xe2\x80\x99 sunshine an\xe2\x80\x99 then tha\xe2\x80\x99ll find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94how?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook along th\xe2\x80\x99 twigs an\xe2\x80\x99 branches an\xe2\x80\x99 if tha\xe2\x80\x99 see a bit of a brown\r\nlump swelling here an\xe2\x80\x99 there, watch it after th\xe2\x80\x99 warm rain an\xe2\x80\x99 see what\r\nhappens.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does tha\xe2\x80\x99 care so much about roses an\xe2\x80\x99 such, all of a sudden?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I want to play that\xe2\x80\x94that I have a garden of my own,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing\xe2\x80\x94and no one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s true.\r\nTha\xe2\x80\x99 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a\r\nlittle sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had\r\nonly felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so\r\nmuch. But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no\r\none found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.\r\n\r\nShe stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as\r\nmany questions as she dared. He answered everyone of them in his queer\r\ngrunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his\r\nspade and leave her. He said something about roses just as she was\r\ngoing away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you go and see those other roses now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\njoints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to\r\nget angry with her, though she did not see why he should.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99 ask so many questions.\r\nTha\xe2\x80\x99rt th\xe2\x80\x99 worst wench for askin\xe2\x80\x99 questions I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever come across. Get\r\nthee gone an\xe2\x80\x99 play thee. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done talkin\xe2\x80\x99 for today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in\r\nstaying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk,\r\nthinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was\r\nanother person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked old\r\nBen Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try to\r\nmake him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everything\r\nin the world about flowers.\r\n\r\nThere was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and\r\nended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she\r\nwould slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were\r\nany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when\r\nshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she\r\nheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nIt was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she\r\nstopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back\r\nagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy\r\nabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his\r\ncheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such\r\nround and such blue eyes in any boy\xe2\x80\x99s face. And on the trunk of the\r\ntree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him,\r\nand from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching\r\nhis neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up\r\nand sniffing with tremulous noses\xe2\x80\x94and actually it appeared as if they\r\nwere all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little\r\ncall his pipe seemed to make.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost\r\nas low as and rather like his piping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99 move,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99d flight \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise\r\nfrom the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though\r\nhe were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the\r\nsquirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant\r\nwithdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop\r\naway, though not at all as if they were frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know tha\xe2\x80\x99rt Miss Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was\r\nDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the\r\nnatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and\r\nhis smile spread all over his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got up slow,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause if tha\xe2\x80\x99 makes a quick move it\r\nstartles \xe2\x80\x99em. A body \xe2\x80\x99as to move gentle an\xe2\x80\x99 speak low when wild things\r\nis about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but\r\nas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she\r\nspoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you get Martha\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded his curly, rust-colored head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground\r\nbeside him when he piped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got th\xe2\x80\x99 garden tools. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little spade an\xe2\x80\x99 rake an\xe2\x80\x99 a fork\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 hoe. Eh! they are good \xe2\x80\x99uns. There\xe2\x80\x99s a trowel, too. An\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 woman\r\nin th\xe2\x80\x99 shop threw in a packet o\xe2\x80\x99 white poppy an\xe2\x80\x99 one o\xe2\x80\x99 blue larkspur\r\nwhen I bought th\xe2\x80\x99 other seeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you show the seeds to me?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said.\r\n\r\nShe wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy.\r\nIt sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would\r\nnot like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes\r\nand with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer\r\nto him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and\r\ngrass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She\r\nliked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red\r\ncheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us sit down on this log and look at them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThey sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of\r\nhis coat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so\r\nmany neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each\r\none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 mignonette an\xe2\x80\x99 poppies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMignonette\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsweetest smellin\xe2\x80\x99 thing as grows, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99ll grow wherever you cast it,\r\nsame as poppies will. Them as\xe2\x80\x99ll come up an\xe2\x80\x99 bloom if you just whistle\r\nto \xe2\x80\x99em, them\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 nicest of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that robin as is callin\xe2\x80\x99 us?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries,\r\nand Mary thought she knew whose it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really calling us?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s callin\xe2\x80\x99 someone he\xe2\x80\x99s friends with. That\xe2\x80\x99s same as sayin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Here I\r\nam. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.\xe2\x80\x99 There he is in the bush.\r\nWhose is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s, but I think he knows me a little,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, he knows thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon in his low voice again. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he likes\r\nthee. He\xe2\x80\x99s took thee on. He\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me all about thee in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had\r\nnoticed before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ntwitter. The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered\r\nquite as if he were replying to a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, he\xe2\x80\x99s a friend o\xe2\x80\x99 yours,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Dickon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he is?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary eagerly. She did so want to know. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou think he really likes me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come near thee if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cBirds is\r\nrare choosers an\xe2\x80\x99 a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaking up to thee now. \xe2\x80\x98Cannot tha\xe2\x80\x99 see a chap?\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s sayin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twittered\r\nand tilted as he hopped on his bush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand everything birds say?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nDickon\xe2\x80\x99s grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and\r\nhe rubbed his rough head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do, and they think I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lived on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em so long. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched \xe2\x80\x99em break shell an\xe2\x80\x99 come out an\xe2\x80\x99 fledge\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 learn to fly an\xe2\x80\x99 begin to sing, till I think I\xe2\x80\x99m one of \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nSometimes I think p\xe2\x80\x99raps I\xe2\x80\x99m a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a\r\nsquirrel, or even a beetle, an\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower\r\nseeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers;\r\nhe told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll plant\r\nthem for thee myself. Where is tha\xe2\x80\x99 garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did\r\nnot know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had\r\nnever thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she went\r\nred and then pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s got a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 garden, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Dickon said.\r\n\r\nIt was true that she had turned red and then pale. Dickon saw her do\r\nit, and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they give thee a bit?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99 got any yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held her hands tighter and turned her eyes toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about boys,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cCould you keep a\r\nsecret, if I told you one? It\xe2\x80\x99s a great secret. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\r\nshould do if anyone found it out. I believe I should die!\xe2\x80\x9d She said the\r\nlast sentence quite fiercely.\r\n\r\nDickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his\r\nrough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m keepin\xe2\x80\x99 secrets all th\xe2\x80\x99 time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nsecrets from th\xe2\x80\x99 other lads, secrets about foxes\xe2\x80\x99 cubs, an\xe2\x80\x99 birds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnests, an\xe2\x80\x99 wild things\xe2\x80\x99 holes, there\xe2\x80\x99d be naught safe on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor. Aye,\r\nI can keep secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve\r\nbut she did it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve stolen a garden,\xe2\x80\x9d she said very fast. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t mine. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into\r\nit. Perhaps everything is dead in it already. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! Nobody has any right to take it from me\r\nwhen I care about it and they don\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99re letting it die, all shut\r\nin by itself,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her\r\nface and burst out crying\xe2\x80\x94poor little Mistress Mary.\r\n\r\nDickon\xe2\x80\x99s curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh-h-h!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he\r\ndid it meant both wonder and sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing belongs to me. I found it\r\nmyself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, and\r\nthey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it from the robin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dickon in a dropped voice.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contrary\r\nagain, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious\r\nand Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so\r\nthickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his\r\nface. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted the\r\nhanging ivy he started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open\r\nand they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her hand\r\nround defiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a secret garden, and I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one in\r\nthe world who wants it to be alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d he almost whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a queer, pretty place! It\xe2\x80\x99s like as\r\nif a body was in a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Mary watched\r\nhim, and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than\r\nMary had walked the first time she had found herself inside the four\r\nwalls. His eyes seemed to be taking in everything\xe2\x80\x94the gray trees with\r\nthe gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches,\r\nthe tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with\r\nthe stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d see this place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\nShe had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must talk low,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cor someone\xe2\x80\x99ll hear us an\xe2\x80\x99 wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto do in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I forgot!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her hand\r\nquickly against her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you know about the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nagain when she had recovered herself.\r\n\r\nDickon nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs used to wonder what it was like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and\r\nhis round eyes looked queerly happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! the nests as\xe2\x80\x99ll be here come springtime,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99d be th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsafest nestin\xe2\x80\x99 place in England. No one never comin\xe2\x80\x99 near an\xe2\x80\x99 tangles\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 trees an\xe2\x80\x99 roses to build in. I wonder all th\xe2\x80\x99 birds on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t build here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill there be roses?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell? I thought perhaps\r\nthey were all dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! No! Not them\xe2\x80\x94not all of \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped over to the nearest tree\xe2\x80\x94an old, old one with gray lichen\r\nall over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and\r\nbranches. He took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its\r\nblades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots o\xe2\x80\x99 dead wood as ought to be cut out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 old wood, but it made some new last year. This here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na new bit,\xe2\x80\x9d and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead\r\nof hard, dry gray.\r\n\r\nMary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat one?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that one quite alive quite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon curved his wide smiling mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as wick as you or me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and Mary remembered that Martha\r\nhad told her that \xe2\x80\x9cwick\xe2\x80\x9d meant \xe2\x80\x9calive\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad it\xe2\x80\x99s wick!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out in her whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI want them all to\r\nbe wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was.\r\nThey went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried his\r\nknife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve run wild,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut th\xe2\x80\x99 strongest ones has fair thrived\r\non it. The delicatest ones has died out, but th\xe2\x80\x99 others has growed an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngrowed, an\xe2\x80\x99 spread an\xe2\x80\x99 spread, till they\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder. See here!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\npulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. \xe2\x80\x9cA body might think this\r\nwas dead wood, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it is\xe2\x80\x94down to th\xe2\x80\x99 root. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut it\r\nlow down an\xe2\x80\x99 see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through,\r\nnot far above the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d he said exultantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI told thee so. There\xe2\x80\x99s green in that\r\nwood yet. Look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it looks a bit greenish an\xe2\x80\x99 juicy like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s wick,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen th\xe2\x80\x99 inside is dry an\xe2\x80\x99 breaks easy, like this here\r\npiece I\xe2\x80\x99ve cut off, it\xe2\x80\x99s done for. There\xe2\x80\x99s a big root here as all this\r\nlive wood sprung out of, an\xe2\x80\x99 if th\xe2\x80\x99 old wood\xe2\x80\x99s cut off an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s dug\r\nround, and took care of there\xe2\x80\x99ll be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he stopped and lifted his face to\r\nlook up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\nfountain o\xe2\x80\x99 roses here this summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong\r\nand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood\r\naway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green\r\nlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell\r\ntoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry\r\nout joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade\r\nof moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He\r\nshowed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade\r\nand stirred the earth and let the air in.\r\n\r\nThey were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses\r\nwhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation\r\nof surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. \xe2\x80\x9cWho did that\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was one of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s own little clearings round the pale green points.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought tha\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t know nothin\xe2\x80\x99 about gardenin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they were so little, and the grass was so\r\nthick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So\r\nI made a place for them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 was right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA gardener couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told thee better.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll grow now like Jack\xe2\x80\x99s bean-stalk. They\xe2\x80\x99re crocuses an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsnowdrops, an\xe2\x80\x99 these here is narcissuses,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to another patch,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can here\xe2\x80\x99s daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran from one clearing to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 has done a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 work for such a little wench,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking\r\nher over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m growing fatter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m growing stronger. I used\r\nalways to be tired. When I dig I\xe2\x80\x99m not tired at all. I like to smell\r\nthe earth when it\xe2\x80\x99s turned up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rare good for thee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nodding his head wisely. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnaught as nice as th\xe2\x80\x99 smell o\xe2\x80\x99 good clean earth, except th\xe2\x80\x99 smell o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfresh growin\xe2\x80\x99 things when th\xe2\x80\x99 rain falls on \xe2\x80\x99em. I get out on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor\r\nmany a day when it\xe2\x80\x99s rainin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 I lie under a bush an\xe2\x80\x99 listen to th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsoft swish o\xe2\x80\x99 drops on th\xe2\x80\x99 heather an\xe2\x80\x99 I just sniff an\xe2\x80\x99 sniff. My nose\r\nend fair quivers like a rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s, mother says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you never catch cold?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly.\r\nShe had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cI never ketched cold since I was born. I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up nesh enough. I\xe2\x80\x99ve chased about th\xe2\x80\x99 moor in all\r\nweathers same as th\xe2\x80\x99 rabbits does. Mother says I\xe2\x80\x99ve sniffed up too much\r\nfresh air for twelve year\xe2\x80\x99 to ever get to sniffin\xe2\x80\x99 with cold. I\xe2\x80\x99m as\r\ntough as a white-thorn knobstick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following him\r\nand helping him with her fork or the trowel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to do here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said once, looking about quite\r\nexultantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come again and help me to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary begged. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\r\ncan help, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell\r\nme. Oh! do come, Dickon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come every day if tha\xe2\x80\x99 wants me, rain or shine,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\r\nstoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best fun I ever had in my life\xe2\x80\x94shut in here an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwakenin\xe2\x80\x99 up a garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will help me to make it alive\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended helplessly. What could you\r\ndo for a boy like that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee what tha\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon, with his happy grin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99ll get fat an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99ll get as hungry as a young fox an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlearn how to talk to th\xe2\x80\x99 robin same as I do. Eh! we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and\r\nbushes with a thoughtful expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make it look like a gardener\xe2\x80\x99s garden, all clipped\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 spick an\xe2\x80\x99 span, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nicer like this with\r\nthings runnin\xe2\x80\x99 wild, an\xe2\x80\x99 swingin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 catchin\xe2\x80\x99 hold of each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us make it tidy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nlike a secret garden if it was tidy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a secret garden sure enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut seems like someone\r\nbesides th\xe2\x80\x99 robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year\xe2\x80\x99\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the door was locked and the key was buried,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one\r\ncould get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a queer place. Seems to me as if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d been a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 prunin\xe2\x80\x99 done here an\xe2\x80\x99 there, later than ten year\xe2\x80\x99\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how could it have been done?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nHe was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! how could it!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWith th\xe2\x80\x99 door locked an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 key\r\nburied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should\r\nnever forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Of\r\ncourse, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickon\r\nbegan to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had\r\nsung at her when he wanted to tease her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there any flowers that look like bells?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLilies o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 valley does,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, digging away with the trowel,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s Canterbury bells, an\xe2\x80\x99 campanulas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s plant some,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s lilies o\xe2\x80\x99 th, valley here already; I saw \xe2\x80\x99em. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\ngrowed too close an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to separate \xe2\x80\x99em, but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty.\r\nTh\xe2\x80\x99 other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you\r\nsome bits o\xe2\x80\x99 plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha\xe2\x80\x99 want \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India\r\nand of how she had hated them and of their calling her \xe2\x80\x9cMistress Mary\r\nQuite Contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey used to dance round and sing at me. They sang\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mistress Mary, quite contrary,\r\n    How does your garden grow?\r\nWith silver bells, and cockle shells,\r\n    And marigolds all in a row.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers\r\nlike silver bells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as contrary as they were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Dickon laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was\r\nsniffing up the scent of it. \xe2\x80\x9cThere doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be no need for no\r\none to be contrary when there\xe2\x80\x99s flowers an\xe2\x80\x99 such like, an\xe2\x80\x99 such lots o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfriendly wild things runnin\xe2\x80\x99 about makin\xe2\x80\x99 homes for themselves, or\r\nbuildin\xe2\x80\x99 nests an\xe2\x80\x99 singin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 whistlin\xe2\x80\x99, does there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped\r\nfrowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDickon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are as nice as Martha said you were. I like\r\nyou, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the\r\ngrate. He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round\r\nblue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly five folk as tha\xe2\x80\x99 likes?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is th\xe2\x80\x99 other four?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother and Martha,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary checked them off on her fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthe robin and Ben Weatherstaff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting\r\nhis arm over his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know tha\xe2\x80\x99 thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m a queer lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think tha\xe2\x80\x99 art\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 queerest little lass I ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a\r\nquestion she had never dreamed of asking anyone before. And she tried\r\nto ask it in Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a\r\nnative was always pleased if you knew his speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes tha\xe2\x80\x99 like me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I does. I likes thee wonderful, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nso does th\xe2\x80\x99 robin, I do believe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s two, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s two for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary\r\nwas startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard\r\nstrike the hour of her midday dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will have to go\r\ntoo, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dinner\xe2\x80\x99s easy to carry about with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMother always lets\r\nme put a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 somethin\xe2\x80\x99 in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a\r\nlumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white\r\nhandkerchief. It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of\r\nsomething laid between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s oftenest naught but bread,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a fine slice\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 fat bacon with it today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun on an\xe2\x80\x99 get thy victuals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be done with mine first.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get some more work done before I start back home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down with his back against a tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call th\xe2\x80\x99 robin up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand give him th\xe2\x80\x99 rind o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 bacon\r\nto peck at. They likes a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 fat wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he\r\nmight be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the\r\ngarden again. He seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way\r\nto the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever happens, you\xe2\x80\x94you never would tell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHis poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of\r\nbread and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf tha\xe2\x80\x99 was a missel thrush an\xe2\x80\x99 showed me where thy nest was, does\r\ntha\xe2\x80\x99 think I\xe2\x80\x99d tell anyone? Not me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 art as safe as a\r\nmissel thrush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she was quite sure she was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her\r\nroom. Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright\r\npink. Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s a bit late,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere has tha\xe2\x80\x99 been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Dickon!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Dickon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he\xe2\x80\x99d come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha exultantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does tha\xe2\x80\x99 like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\x94I think he\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary in a determined voice.\r\n\r\nMartha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 best lad as ever was born, but us never\r\nthought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it to turn up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 his eyes is so round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha, a trifle doubtful. \xe2\x80\x9cThough\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re a nice color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like them round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they are exactly the color of the\r\nsky over the moor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha beamed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother says he made \xe2\x80\x99em that color with always lookin\xe2\x80\x99 up at th\xe2\x80\x99 birds\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love his big mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary obstinately. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish mine were just\r\nlike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha chuckled delightedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99d look rare an\xe2\x80\x99 funny in thy bit of a face,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nknowed it would be that way when tha\xe2\x80\x99 saw him. How did tha\xe2\x80\x99 like th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nseeds an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 garden tools?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know he brought them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! I never thought of him not bringin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em. He\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to bring \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nif they was in Yorkshire. He\xe2\x80\x99s such a trusty lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but\r\nshe did not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening\r\ntools, and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened. This was\r\nwhen she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho did tha\xe2\x80\x99 ask about it?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked anybody yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask th\xe2\x80\x99 head gardener. He\xe2\x80\x99s too grand, Mr. Roach is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen undergardeners and\r\nBen Weatherstaff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was you, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask Ben Weatherstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d advised Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nhalf as bad as he looks, for all he\xe2\x80\x99s so crabbed. Mr. Craven lets him\r\ndo what he likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nused to make her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99d find you a corner\r\nsomewhere out o\xe2\x80\x99 the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one _could_ mind my\r\nhaving it, could they?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no reason,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do no\r\nharm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the\r\ntable she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, but\r\nMartha stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got somethin\xe2\x80\x99 to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I\xe2\x80\x99d let you eat\r\nyour dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this mornin\xe2\x80\x99 and I think he\r\nwants to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary turned quite pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy! Why! He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see me when I came. I\r\nheard Pitcher say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Martha, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Medlock says it\xe2\x80\x99s because o\xe2\x80\x99 mother.\r\nShe was walkin\xe2\x80\x99 to Thwaite village an\xe2\x80\x99 she met him. She\xe2\x80\x99d never spoke\r\nto him before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three\r\ntimes. He\xe2\x80\x99d forgot, but mother hadn\xe2\x80\x99t an\xe2\x80\x99 she made bold to stop him. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what she said to him about you but she said somethin\xe2\x80\x99 as put\r\nhim in th\xe2\x80\x99 mind to see you before he goes away again, tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cis he going away tomorrow? I am so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 for a long time. He mayn\xe2\x80\x99t come back till autumn or winter.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to travel in foreign places. He\xe2\x80\x99s always doin\xe2\x80\x99 it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad\xe2\x80\x94so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary thankfully.\r\n\r\nIf he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be\r\ntime to watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out then\r\nand took it away from her she would have had that much at least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you think he will want to see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs.\r\nMedlock walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and her\r\ncollar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\non it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years\r\nago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up. She looked nervous\r\nand excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour hair\xe2\x80\x99s rough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and brush it. Martha, help\r\nher to slip on her best dress. Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him\r\nin his study.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the pink left Mary\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she felt\r\nherself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did not\r\neven answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom,\r\nfollowed by Martha. She said nothing while her dress was changed, and\r\nher hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs.\r\nMedlock down the corridors, in silence. What was there for her to say?\r\nShe was obliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he would not like her, and\r\nshe would not like him. She knew what he would think of her.\r\n\r\nShe was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. At\r\nlast Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when someone said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthey entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair before\r\nthe fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Miss Mary, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you to\r\ntake her away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craven.\r\n\r\nWhen she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a\r\nplain little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see\r\nthat the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with\r\nhigh, rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with\r\nwhite. He turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMary went to him.\r\n\r\nHe was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been\r\nso miserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him\r\nand as if he did not know what in the world to do with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you well?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they take good care of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very thin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am getting fatter,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary answered in what she knew was her stiffest\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhat an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely\r\nsaw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly\r\nkeep his thoughts upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could I remember you? I intended to send\r\nyou a governess or a nurse, or someone of that sort, but I forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and then the lump in her throat choked\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to say?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94I am too big for a nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd please\xe2\x80\x94please don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake me have a governess yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what the Sowerby woman said,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered absent-mindedly.\r\n\r\nThen Mary gathered a scrap of courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she\xe2\x80\x94is she Martha\xe2\x80\x99s mother?\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows about children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has twelve. She knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to rouse himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to play out of doors,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary answered, hoping that her voice did\r\nnot tremble. \xe2\x80\x9cI never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and I\r\nam getting fatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was watching her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nargued Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you play?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cMartha\xe2\x80\x99s mother sent me a skipping-rope. I\r\nskip and run\xe2\x80\x94and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick\r\nup out of the earth. I don\xe2\x80\x99t do any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a worried voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could not\r\ndo any harm, a child like you! You may do what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see\r\nthe excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I?\xe2\x80\x9d she said tremulously.\r\n\r\nHer anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you may. I am your\r\nguardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you time\r\nor attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish you\r\nto be happy and comfortable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about children, but\r\nMrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you today\r\nbecause Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you. Her daughter had talked\r\nabout you. She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows all about children,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said again in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ought to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Craven. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought her rather bold to stop me\r\non the moor, but she said\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Craven had been kind to her.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed\r\nhard for him to speak his dead wife\xe2\x80\x99s name. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a respectable\r\nwoman. Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things. Play out\r\nof doors as much as you like. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big place and you may go where you\r\nlike and amuse yourself as you like. Is there anything you want?\xe2\x80\x9d as if\r\na sudden thought had struck him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want toys, books, dolls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I,\xe2\x80\x9d quavered Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cmight I have a bit of earth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound\r\nand that they were not the ones she had meant to say. Mr. Craven looked\r\nquite startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarth!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo plant seeds in\xe2\x80\x94to make things grow\xe2\x80\x94to see them come alive,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you\xe2\x80\x94care about gardens so much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about them in India,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI was always ill and\r\ntired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand and\r\nstuck flowers in them. But here it is different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit of earth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she\r\nmust have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to her\r\nhis dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have as much earth as you want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remind me of\r\nsomeone else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you see a\r\nbit of earth you want,\xe2\x80\x9d with something like a smile, \xe2\x80\x9ctake it, child,\r\nand make it come alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I take it from anywhere\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s not wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! You must go now, I am tired.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntouched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by. I shall be away all\r\nsummer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have been\r\nwaiting in the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Medlock,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Craven said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I have seen the child I\r\nunderstand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She must be less delicate before\r\nshe begins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in\r\nthe garden. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh\r\nair and romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then\r\nand she may sometimes go to the cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clook after\xe2\x80\x9d Mary too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and had\r\nindeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she was\r\nfond of Martha\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSusan Sowerby and me went to school\r\ntogether and she\xe2\x80\x99s as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you\xe2\x80\x99d find\r\nin a day\xe2\x80\x99s walk. I never had any children myself and she\xe2\x80\x99s had twelve,\r\nand there never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get no harm\r\nfrom them. I\xe2\x80\x99d always take Susan Sowerby\xe2\x80\x99s advice about children\r\nmyself. She\xe2\x80\x99s what you might call healthy-minded\xe2\x80\x94if you understand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Craven answered. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Miss Mary away now and send\r\nPitcher to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew\r\nback to her room. She found Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact,\r\nhurried back after she had removed the dinner service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can have my garden!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI may have it where I like! I am\r\nnot going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming to\r\nsee me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me\r\ncould not do any harm and I may do what I like\xe2\x80\x94anywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha delightedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was nice of him wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartha,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9che is really a nice man, only his face\r\nis so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so\r\nmuch longer than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would\r\nhave to set out early on his five-mile walk. When she slipped through\r\nthe door under the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left\r\nhim. The gardening tools were laid together under a tree. She ran to\r\nthem, looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen.\r\nHe had gone away and the secret garden was empty\xe2\x80\x94except for the robin\r\nwho had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush\r\nwatching her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said woefully. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! was he\xe2\x80\x94was he\xe2\x80\x94was he only a wood\r\nfairy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye. It\r\nwas a piece of paper, in fact, it was a piece of the letter she had\r\nprinted for Martha to send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with\r\na long thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there. There\r\nwere some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture. At first\r\nshe could not tell what it was. Then she saw it was meant for a nest\r\nwith a bird sitting on it. Underneath were the printed letters and they\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will cum bak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI AM COLIN\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and\r\nshe showed it to Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha with great pride. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew our Dickon was as\r\nclever as that. That there\xe2\x80\x99s a picture of a missel thrush on her nest,\r\nas large as life an\xe2\x80\x99 twice as natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had\r\nmeant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was\r\nher nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that\r\nqueer, common boy!\r\n\r\nShe hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep\r\nlooking forward to the morning.\r\n\r\nBut you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly\r\nin the springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rain\r\nbeating with heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down in\r\ntorrents and the wind was \xe2\x80\x9cwuthering\xe2\x80\x9d round the corners and in the\r\nchimneys of the huge old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable\r\nand angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rain is as contrary as I ever was,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt came because it\r\nknew I did not want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did not\r\ncry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she\r\nhated the wind and its \xe2\x80\x9cwuthering.\xe2\x80\x9d She could not go to sleep again.\r\nThe mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If\r\nshe had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwuthered\xe2\x80\x9d and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the\r\npane!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on\r\ncrying,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour,\r\nwhen suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward\r\nthe door listening. She listened and she listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the wind now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a loud whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nwind. It is different. It is that crying I heard before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a\r\nfar-off faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutes\r\nand each minute she became more and more sure. She felt as if she must\r\nfind out what it was. It seemed even stranger than the secret garden\r\nand the buried key. Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood\r\nmade her bold. She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to find out what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is in bed and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Mrs. Medlock\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly\r\nout of the room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was\r\ntoo excited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners she\r\nmust turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with\r\ntapestry\xe2\x80\x94the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost\r\nherself. The sound had come up that passage. So she went on with her\r\ndim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she\r\nfancied she could hear it. The far-off faint crying went on and led\r\nher. Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was\r\nthis the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was.\r\nDown this passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps,\r\nand then to the right again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.\r\n\r\nShe pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood\r\nin the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was\r\nnot loud. It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few\r\nyards farther on there was a door. She could see a glimmer of light\r\ncoming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it was\r\nquite a young Someone.\r\n\r\nSo she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was\r\nstanding in the room!\r\n\r\nIt was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was a\r\nlow fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the\r\nside of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was\r\nlying a boy, crying fretfully.\r\n\r\nMary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep\r\nagain and was dreaming without knowing it.\r\n\r\nThe boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to\r\nhave eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over\r\nhis forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. He\r\nlooked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he\r\nwere tired and cross than as if he were in pain.\r\n\r\nMary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her\r\nbreath. Then she crept across the room, and, as she drew nearer, the\r\nlight attracted the boy\xe2\x80\x99s attention and he turned his head on his\r\npillow and stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they\r\nseemed immense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last in a half-frightened whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a\r\nghost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half\r\nfrightened. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing what\r\nstrange eyes he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big for\r\nhis face because they had black lashes all round them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied after waiting a moment or so. \xe2\x80\x9cI am Colin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Colin?\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Colin Craven. Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one ever told me he had a boy! Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her with\r\nan anxious expression.\r\n\r\nShe came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are real, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have such real dreams very\r\noften. You might be one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she\r\nput a piece of it between his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRub that and see how thick and warm it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will pinch\r\nyou a little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I\r\nthought you might be a dream too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep and I\r\nheard someone crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were you\r\ncrying for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me your\r\nname again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look a\r\nlittle more as if he believed in her reality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey daren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I should have been afraid you would see me. I won\xe2\x80\x99t let people\r\nsee me and talk me over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My father\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to\r\nspeak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan\xe2\x80\x99t live. My\r\nfather hates to think I may be like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a queer house this is!\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a queer house!\r\nEverything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are\r\nlocked up\xe2\x80\x94and you! Have you been locked up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I stay in this room because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be moved out of it. It\r\ntires me too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your father come and see you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary ventured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary could not help asking again.\r\n\r\nA sort of angry shadow passed over the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at\r\nme. He thinks I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard people talking. He almost\r\nhates me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hates the garden, because she died,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary half speaking to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat garden?\xe2\x80\x9d the boy asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! just\xe2\x80\x94just a garden she used to like,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nbeen here always?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside,\r\nbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an iron\r\nthing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to\r\nsee me and said it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep me\r\nout in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t when first I came here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you keep looking\r\nat me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the dreams that are so real,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered rather fretfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes when I open my eyes I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re both awake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. She glanced round the room with its high\r\nceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks quite like a\r\ndream, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the middle of the night, and everybody in the house is\r\nasleep\xe2\x80\x94everybody but us. We are wide awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to be a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said restlessly.\r\n\r\nMary thought of something all at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t like people to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want me to go\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be sure you were a dream if you went. If you\r\nare real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear about\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the\r\ncushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stay\r\nin the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want me to tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted to\r\nknow which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had\r\nbeen doing; if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had\r\nlived before she came to Yorkshire. She answered all these questions\r\nand many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened. He made her\r\ntell him a great deal about India and about her voyage across the\r\nocean. She found out that because he had been an invalid he had not\r\nlearned things as other children had. One of his nurses had taught him\r\nto read when he was quite little and he was always reading and looking\r\nat pictures in splendid books.\r\n\r\nThough his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given all\r\nsorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to\r\nhave been amused, however. He could have anything he asked for and was\r\nnever made to do anything he did not like to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is obliged to do what pleases me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said indifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmakes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to\r\nmatter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s voice. As\r\nshe went on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once or\r\ntwice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But at\r\nlast he asked a question which opened up a new subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ten,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, \xe2\x80\x9cand so\r\nare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded in a surprised voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was\r\nburied. And it has been locked for ten years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key buried?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x94it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nlocked the door. No one\xe2\x80\x94no one knew where he buried the key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a garden is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Colin persisted eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncareful answer.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He too\r\nhad had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden\r\nattracted him as it had attracted her. He asked question after\r\nquestion. Where was it? Had she never looked for the door? Had she\r\nnever asked the gardeners?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI think they have been told not\r\nto answer questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would make them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he could\r\nmake people answer questions, who knew what might happen!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is obliged to please me. I told you that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nwere to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all know\r\nthat. I would make them tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could see\r\nquite plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that the\r\nwhole world belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he\r\nspoke of not living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you won\xe2\x80\x99t live?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, partly because she was\r\ncurious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I shall,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered as indifferently as he had\r\nspoken before. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since I remember anything I have heard people say\r\nI shan\xe2\x80\x99t. At first they thought I was too little to understand and now\r\nthey think I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear. But I do. My doctor is my father\xe2\x80\x99s cousin. He\r\nis quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my\r\nfather is dead. I should think he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to live?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to die.\r\nWhen I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard you crying three times,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I did not know\r\nwho it was. Were you crying about that?\xe2\x80\x9d She did so want him to forget\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us talk about something else. Talk\r\nabout that garden. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary, in quite a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on persistently. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever really wanted to\r\nsee anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the key dug\r\nup. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in my\r\nchair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them open\r\nthe door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like\r\nstars and looked more immense than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have to please me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make them take me there and\r\nI will let you go, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s hands clutched each other. Everything would be\r\nspoiled\xe2\x80\x94everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never again\r\nfeel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t do that!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out.\r\n\r\nHe stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you wanted to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered almost with a sob in her throat, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you make\r\nthem open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned still farther forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA secret,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s words almost tumbled over one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see\xe2\x80\x94you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she panted, \xe2\x80\x9cif no one knows but ourselves\xe2\x80\x94if there\r\nwas a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy\xe2\x80\x94if there was\xe2\x80\x94and we could\r\nfind it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind\r\nus, and no one knew anyone was inside and we called it our garden and\r\npretended that\xe2\x80\x94that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and if\r\nwe played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it\r\nall come alive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it dead?\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt soon will be if no one cares for it,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bulbs will\r\nlive but the roses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped her again as excited as she was herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are bulbs?\xe2\x80\x9d he put in quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in the\r\nearth now\xe2\x80\x94pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the spring coming?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it like? You don\xe2\x80\x99t see it in\r\nrooms if you are ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the\r\nsunshine, and things pushing up and working under the earth,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMary. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could\r\nwatch the things grow bigger every day, and see how many roses are\r\nalive. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see how much nicer it would be if\r\nit was a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never had a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that one about not living to\r\ngrow up. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know I know that, so it is a sort of secret. But I\r\nlike this kind better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t make them take you to the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mary,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\xe2\x80\x94I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime. And\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you can\r\nalways do what you want to do, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps we might find some boy\r\nwho would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a\r\nsecret garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should\xe2\x80\x94like\xe2\x80\x94that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould like that. I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of\r\nkeeping the secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that if\r\nshe kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as\r\nshe had seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to\r\nthink that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I _think_ it would be like, if we could go into\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been shut up so long things have grown into a\r\ntangle perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the\r\nroses which _might_ have clambered from tree to tree and hung\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94about the many birds which _might_ have built their nests there\r\nbecause it was so safe. And then she told him about the robin and Ben\r\nWeatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was\r\nso easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. The\r\nrobin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost\r\nbeautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer than\r\nherself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know birds could be like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you stay in\r\na room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel as\r\nif you had been inside that garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidently\r\ndid not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to let you look at something,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that\r\nrose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a\r\ncurtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a cord hanging from it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and pull it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it the\r\nsilk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a\r\npicture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had\r\nbright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were\r\nexactly like Colin\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big\r\nas they really were because of the black lashes all round them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin complainingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why she\r\ndied. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow queer!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ngrumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would not\r\nhave hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back.\r\nDraw the curtain again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is much prettier than you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut her eyes are just like\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the curtain\r\ndrawn over her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made them do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see her\r\nlooking at me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable.\r\nBesides, she is mine and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want everyone to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would do as I told her to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should tell her\r\nthat I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am glad you\r\ncame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI will come as often as I can, but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nhesitated\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to look every day for the garden door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, \xe2\x80\x9cand you can tell me about it afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spoke\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you shall be a secret, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not tell them\r\nuntil they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and\r\nsay that I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know her very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cShe waits on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head toward the outer corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went away\r\nyesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha\r\nattend to me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell you when to\r\ncome here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mary understood Martha\xe2\x80\x99s troubled look when she had asked\r\nquestions about the crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartha knew about you all the time?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me and\r\nthen Martha comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been here a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I go away now? Your\r\neyes look sleepy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rather shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut your eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will\r\ndo what my Ayah used to do in India. I will pat your hand and stroke it\r\nand sing something quite low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like that perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he said drowsily.\r\n\r\nSomehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so she\r\nleaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a\r\nvery low little chanting song in Hindustani.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is nice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said more drowsily still, and she went on chanting\r\nand stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes were\r\nlying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast\r\nasleep. So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away without\r\nmaking a sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nA YOUNG RAJAH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not\r\nstopped pouring down. There could be no going out of doors. Martha was\r\nso busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in the\r\nafternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery. She\r\ncame bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked as soon as they sat down.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 looks as if tha\xe2\x80\x99d somethin\xe2\x80\x99 to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have. I have found out what the crying was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nMartha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard it in the night,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I got up and went to see\r\nwhere it came from. It was Colin. I found him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha\xe2\x80\x99s face became red with fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! Miss Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d she said half crying. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94tha\xe2\x80\x99 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t! Tha\xe2\x80\x99ll get me in trouble. I never told thee nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nabout him\xe2\x80\x94but tha\xe2\x80\x99ll get me in trouble. I shall lose my place and\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99ll mother do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t lose your place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was glad I came. We talked\r\nand talked and he said he was glad I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cArt tha\xe2\x80\x99 sure? Tha\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike when anything vexes him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big lad to cry like a baby, but\r\nwhen he\xe2\x80\x99s in a passion he\xe2\x80\x99ll fair scream just to frighten us. He knows\r\nus daren\xe2\x80\x99t call our souls our own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t vexed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked him if I should go away and he\r\nmade me stay. He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool and\r\ntalked to him about India and about the robin and gardens. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet me go. He let me see his mother\xe2\x80\x99s picture. Before I left him I sang\r\nhim to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha fairly gasped with amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can scarcely believe thee!\xe2\x80\x9d she protested. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as if tha\xe2\x80\x99d walked\r\nstraight into a lion\xe2\x80\x99s den. If he\xe2\x80\x99d been like he is most times he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave throwed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th\xe2\x80\x99 house. He\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let strangers look at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe let me look at him. I looked at him all the time and he looked at\r\nme. We stared!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried agitated Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mrs. Medlock\r\nfinds out, she\xe2\x80\x99ll think I broke orders and told thee and I shall be\r\npacked back to mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\na sort of secret just at first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he says\r\neverybody is obliged to do as he pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that\xe2\x80\x99s true enough\xe2\x80\x94th\xe2\x80\x99 bad lad!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Martha, wiping her\r\nforehead with her apron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to come and talk to him\r\nevery day. And you are to tell me when he wants me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall lose my place\xe2\x80\x94I shall for sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is\r\nordered to obey him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary argued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes tha\xe2\x80\x99 mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Martha with wide open eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he was\r\nnice to thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he almost liked me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tha\xe2\x80\x99 must have bewitched him!\xe2\x80\x9d decided Martha, drawing a long\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Magic?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about Magic in India,\r\nbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it. I just went into his room and I was so surprised\r\nto see him I stood and stared. And then he turned round and stared at\r\nme. And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he\r\nwas. And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of\r\nthe night and not knowing about each other. And we began to ask each\r\nother questions. And when I asked him if I must go away he said I must\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 world\xe2\x80\x99s comin\xe2\x80\x99 to a end!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows for sure and certain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Craven went off\r\nhis head like when he was born. Th\xe2\x80\x99 doctors thought he\xe2\x80\x99d have to be put\r\nin a \xe2\x80\x99sylum. It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you. He\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set eyes on th\xe2\x80\x99 baby. He just raved and said it\xe2\x80\x99d be another\r\nhunchback like him and it\xe2\x80\x99d better die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Colin a hunchback?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he began all wrong. Mother said that\r\nthere was enough trouble and raging in th\xe2\x80\x99 house to set any child\r\nwrong. They was afraid his back was weak an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99ve always been takin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncare of it\xe2\x80\x94keepin\xe2\x80\x99 him lyin\xe2\x80\x99 down and not lettin\xe2\x80\x99 him walk. Once they\r\nmade him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill. Then a\r\nbig doctor came to see him an\xe2\x80\x99 made them take it off. He talked to th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nother doctor quite rough\xe2\x80\x94in a polite way. He said there\xe2\x80\x99d been too much\r\nmedicine and too much lettin\xe2\x80\x99 him have his own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s a very spoiled boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 worst young nowt as ever was!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say as\r\nhe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been ill a good bit. He\xe2\x80\x99s had coughs an\xe2\x80\x99 colds that\xe2\x80\x99s nearly\r\nkilled him two or three times. Once he had rheumatic fever an\xe2\x80\x99 once he\r\nhad typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then. He\xe2\x80\x99d been out of\r\nhis head an\xe2\x80\x99 she was talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to th\xe2\x80\x99 nurse, thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll die this time sure enough, an\xe2\x80\x99 best thing\r\nfor him an\xe2\x80\x99 for everybody.\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 she looked at him an\xe2\x80\x99 there he was with\r\nhis big eyes open, starin\xe2\x80\x99 at her as sensible as she was herself. She\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know wha\xe2\x80\x99d happen but he just stared at her an\xe2\x80\x99 says, \xe2\x80\x98You give\r\nme some water an\xe2\x80\x99 stop talkin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he will die?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother says there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why any child should live that gets no\r\nfresh air an\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but lie on his back an\xe2\x80\x99 read\r\npicture-books an\xe2\x80\x99 take medicine. He\xe2\x80\x99s weak and hates th\xe2\x80\x99 trouble o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbein\xe2\x80\x99 taken out o\xe2\x80\x99 doors, an\xe2\x80\x99 he gets cold so easy he says it makes him\r\nill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary sat and looked at the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cif it would not do him good to go out\r\ninto a garden and watch things growing. It did me good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of th\xe2\x80\x99 worst fits he ever had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha, \xe2\x80\x9cwas one time they\r\ntook him out where the roses is by the fountain. He\xe2\x80\x99d been readin\xe2\x80\x99 in a\r\npaper about people gettin\xe2\x80\x99 somethin\xe2\x80\x99 he called \xe2\x80\x98rose cold\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 he began\r\nto sneeze an\xe2\x80\x99 said he\xe2\x80\x99d got it an\xe2\x80\x99 then a new gardener as didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 rules passed by an\xe2\x80\x99 looked at him curious. He threw himself into a\r\npassion an\xe2\x80\x99 he said he\xe2\x80\x99d looked at him because he was going to be a\r\nhunchback. He cried himself into a fever an\xe2\x80\x99 was ill all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he ever gets angry at me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never go and see him again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have thee if he wants thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 may as well know\r\nthat at th\xe2\x80\x99 start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say th\xe2\x80\x99 nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhope he\xe2\x80\x99s in a good temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with a\r\npuzzled expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, tha\xe2\x80\x99 has bewitched him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s up on his sofa with his\r\npicture-books. He\xe2\x80\x99s told the nurse to stay away until six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nto wait in the next room. Th\xe2\x80\x99 minute she was gone he called me to him\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 says, \xe2\x80\x98I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and remember\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not to tell anyone.\xe2\x80\x99 You\xe2\x80\x99d better go as quick as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was quite willing to go quickly. She did not want to see Colin as\r\nmuch as she wanted to see Dickon; but she wanted to see him very much.\r\n\r\nThere was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room, and in\r\nthe daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed. There were\r\nrich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the\r\nwalls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the\r\ngray sky and falling rain. Colin looked rather like a picture himself.\r\nHe was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded\r\ncushion. He had a red spot on each cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about you all morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about you, too,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nfrightened Martha is. She says Mrs. Medlock will think she told me\r\nabout you and then she will be sent away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe frowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell her to come here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is in the next room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary went and brought her back. Poor Martha was shaking in her shoes.\r\nColin was still frowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you to do what I please or have you not?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to do what you please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Martha faltered, turning quite\r\nred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Medlock to do what I please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody has, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlock\r\nsend you away if she finds it out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t let her, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Martha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send _her_ away if she dares to say a word about such a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Master Craven grandly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d bobbing a curtsy, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to do my duty, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want is your duty\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin more grandly still. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\ncare of you. Now go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing at\r\nhim as if he had set her wondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you look at me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking about two things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they? Sit down and tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, seating herself on the big stool.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He had rubies and emeralds\r\nand diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as you\r\nspoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he told them\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nminute. I think they would have been killed if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut first\r\ntell me what the second thing was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9chow different you are from Dickon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Dickon?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a queer name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe might as well tell him, she thought she could talk about Dickon\r\nwithout mentioning the secret garden. She had liked to hear Martha talk\r\nabout him. Besides, she longed to talk about him. It would seem to\r\nbring him nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is Martha\xe2\x80\x99s brother. He is twelve years old,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\nnot like anyone else in the world. He can charm foxes and squirrels and\r\nbirds just as the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a very soft\r\ntune on a pipe and they come and listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged one\r\nsuddenly toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nand look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and he\r\nturned to one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan he do that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe played on his pipe and they listened,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t call it Magic. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s because he lives on the moor so\r\nmuch and he knows their ways. He says he feels sometimes as if he was a\r\nbird or a rabbit himself, he likes them so. I think he asked the robin\r\nquestions. It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger and\r\nthe spots on his cheeks burned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me some more about him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows all about eggs and nests,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he knows where\r\nfoxes and badgers and otters live. He keeps them secret so that other\r\nboys won\xe2\x80\x99t find their holes and frighten them. He knows about\r\neverything that grows or lives on the moor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he like the moor?\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can he when it\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\ngreat, bare, dreary place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most beautiful place,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThousands of lovely\r\nthings grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy\r\nbuilding nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing\r\nor squeaking to each other. They are so busy and having such fun under\r\nthe earth or in the trees or heather. It\xe2\x80\x99s their world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know all that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, turning on his elbow to look at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been there once, really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary suddenly remembering.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was hideous. Martha\r\ntold me about it first and then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it you\r\nfeel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in\r\nthe heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nall full of bees and butterflies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never see anything if you are ill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin restlessly. He\r\nlooked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and\r\nwondering what it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t if you stay in a room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on the moor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a resentful tone.\r\n\r\nMary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might\xe2\x80\x94sometime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved as if he were startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary unsympathetically. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the way\r\nhe had of talking about dying. She did not feel very sympathetic. She\r\nfelt rather as if he almost boasted about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it ever since I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered crossly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nare always whispering about it and thinking I don\xe2\x80\x99t notice. They wish I\r\nwould, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Mary felt quite contrary. She pinched her lips together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they wished I would,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Who wishes you would?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants\xe2\x80\x94and of course Dr. Craven because he would get\r\nMisselthwaite and be rich instead of poor. He daren\xe2\x80\x99t say so, but he\r\nalways looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his\r\nface got quite fat. I think my father wishes it, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary quite obstinately.\r\n\r\nThat made Colin turn and look at her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he were\r\nthinking. And there was quite a long silence. Perhaps they were both of\r\nthem thinking strange things children do not usually think of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the grand doctor from London, because he made them take the\r\niron thing off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary at last \xe2\x80\x9cDid he say you were going to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t whisper,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he knew I hated\r\nwhispering. I heard him say one thing quite aloud. He said, \xe2\x80\x98The lad\r\nmight live if he would make up his mind to it. Put him in the humor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIt sounded as if he was in a temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\r\nreflecting. She felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one\r\nway or the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe Dickon would. He\xe2\x80\x99s always talking about\r\nlive things. He never talks about dead things or things that are ill.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying\xe2\x80\x94or looking down\r\nat the earth to see something growing. He has such round blue eyes and\r\nthey are so wide open with looking about. And he laughs such a big\r\nlaugh with his wide mouth\xe2\x80\x94and his cheeks are as red\xe2\x80\x94as red as\r\ncherries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite\r\nchanged at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us talk about dying; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\r\nLet us talk about living. Let us talk and talk about Dickon. And then\r\nwe will look at your pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the best thing she could have said. To talk about Dickon meant\r\nto talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people\r\nwho lived in it on sixteen shillings a week\xe2\x80\x94and the children who got\r\nfat on the moor grass like the wild ponies. And about Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94and the skipping-rope\xe2\x80\x94and the moor with the sun on it\xe2\x80\x94and about\r\npale green points sticking up out of the black sod. And it was all so\r\nalive that Mary talked more than she had ever talked before\xe2\x80\x94and Colin\r\nboth talked and listened as he had never done either before. And they\r\nboth began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy\r\ntogether. And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much\r\nnoise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old\r\ncreatures\xe2\x80\x94instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who\r\nbelieved that he was going to die.\r\n\r\nThey enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they\r\nforgot about the time. They had been laughing quite loudly over Ben\r\nWeatherstaff and his robin, and Colin was actually sitting up as if he\r\nhad forgotten about his weak back, when he suddenly remembered\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are cousins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered\r\nthis simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had\r\ngot into the humor to laugh at anything. And in the midst of the fun\r\nthe door opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\nDr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back\r\nbecause he had accidentally bumped against her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her eyes almost starting\r\nout of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Craven, coming forward. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin answered as if\r\nneither the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s alarm nor Mrs. Medlock\xe2\x80\x99s terror were of the\r\nslightest consequence. He was as little disturbed or frightened as if\r\nan elderly cat and dog had walked into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my cousin, Mary Lennox,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked her to come and\r\ntalk to me. I like her. She must come and talk to me whenever I send\r\nfor her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir\xe2\x80\x9d she panted. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it\xe2\x80\x99s happened. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\nservant on the place tha\xe2\x80\x99d dare to talk\xe2\x80\x94they all have their orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody told her anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cShe heard me crying and found\r\nme herself. I am glad she came. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly, Medlock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plain\r\nthat he dare not oppose his patient. He sat down by Colin and felt his\r\npulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement is not good\r\nfor you, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be excited if she kept away,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Colin, his eyes\r\nbeginning to look dangerously sparkling. \xe2\x80\x9cI am better. She makes me\r\nbetter. The nurse must bring up her tea with mine. We will have tea\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, but\r\nthere was evidently nothing to be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does look rather better, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d ventured Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thinking the matter over\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che looked better this morning before\r\nshe came into the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came into the room last night. She stayed with me a long time. She\r\nsang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was better when I wakened up. I wanted my breakfast. I want my tea\r\nnow. Tell nurse, Medlock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven did not stay very long. He talked to the nurse for a few\r\nminutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to\r\nColin. He must not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill;\r\nhe must not forget that he was very easily tired. Mary thought that\r\nthere seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nColin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on\r\nDr. Craven\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _want_ to forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cShe makes me forget it. That\r\nis why I want her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room. He gave a puzzled\r\nglance at the little girl sitting on the large stool. She had become a\r\nstiff, silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not see\r\nwhat the attraction was. The boy actually did look brighter,\r\nhowever\xe2\x80\x94and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are always wanting me to eat things when I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nColin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the\r\nsofa. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll eat I will. Those muffins look so nice and hot.\r\nTell me about Rajahs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nNEST BUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and\r\nthe sun which poured down was quite hot. Though there had been no\r\nchance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had\r\nenjoyed herself very much. The week had not seemed long. She had spent\r\nhours of every day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or\r\ngardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor. They had looked at the\r\nsplendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to\r\nColin, and sometimes he had read a little to her. When he was amused\r\nand interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all,\r\nexcept that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go\r\nfollowing things up like you did that night,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Medlock said once.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not been a sort of blessing to the lot of\r\nus. He\xe2\x80\x99s not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. The\r\nnurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of\r\nhim, but she says she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind staying now you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on duty with\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d laughing a little.\r\n\r\nIn her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the\r\nsecret garden. There were certain things she wanted to find out from\r\nhim, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct\r\nquestions. In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, she\r\nwanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a\r\nsecret to. He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently so\r\npleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she\r\nthought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not known him long\r\nenough to be sure. The second thing she wanted to find out was this: If\r\nhe could be trusted\xe2\x80\x94if he really could\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be possible to take\r\nhim to the garden without having anyone find it out? The grand doctor\r\nhad said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he would\r\nnot mind fresh air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a great deal\r\nof fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he\r\nmight not think so much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glass\r\nsometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a\r\ndifferent creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from\r\nIndia. This child looked nicer. Even Martha had seen a change in her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 air from th\xe2\x80\x99 moor has done thee good already,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99rt not nigh so yeller and tha\xe2\x80\x99rt not nigh so scrawny. Even tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhair doesn\xe2\x80\x99t slamp down on tha\xe2\x80\x99 head so flat. It\xe2\x80\x99s got some life in it\r\nso as it sticks out a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s growing stronger and fatter. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s more of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks it, for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha, ruffling it up a little round her\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99rt not half so ugly when it\xe2\x80\x99s that way an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nred in tha\xe2\x80\x99 cheeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would be\r\ngood for Colin. But then, if he hated people to look at him, perhaps he\r\nwould not like to see Dickon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does it make you angry when you are looked at?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always hated it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9ceven when I was very little. Then\r\nwhen they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage\r\neverybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and\r\nthen they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live to grow up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat my\r\ncheeks and say \xe2\x80\x98Poor child!\xe2\x80\x99 Once when a lady did that I screamed out\r\nloud and bit her hand. She was so frightened she ran away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thought you had gone mad like a dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, not at all\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what she thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, frowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why you didn\xe2\x80\x99t scream and bite me when I came into your\r\nroom?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. Then she began to smile slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were a ghost or a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t bite a\r\nghost or a dream, and if you scream they don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you hate it if\xe2\x80\x94if a boy looked at you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary asked uncertainly.\r\n\r\nHe lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quite slowly, as if he were thinking over\r\nevery word, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s one boy I believe I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s that boy\r\nwho knows where the foxes live\xe2\x80\x94Dickon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe birds don\xe2\x80\x99t and other animals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, still thinking it over,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of animal charmer and I am\r\na boy animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their both\r\nlaughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in\r\nhis hole very funny indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about Dickon.\r\n\r\nOn that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very\r\nearly. The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and\r\nthere was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of\r\nbed and ran to the window. She drew up the blinds and opened the window\r\nitself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The\r\nmoor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had\r\nhappened to it. There were tender little fluting sounds here and there\r\nand everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a\r\nconcert. Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s warm\xe2\x80\x94warm!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will make the green points push up and\r\nup and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with\r\nall their might under the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could,\r\nbreathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because\r\nshe remembered what Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s mother had said about the end of his nose\r\nquivering like a rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be very early,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe little clouds are all pink and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen the sky look like this. No one is up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even hear\r\nthe stable boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t wait! I am going to see the garden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her\r\nclothes in five minutes. She knew a small side door which she could\r\nunbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on\r\nher shoes in the hall. She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when\r\nthe door was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there\r\nshe was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and\r\nwith the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the\r\nfluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree. She\r\nclasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so\r\nblue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light\r\nthat she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that\r\nthrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it. She ran\r\naround the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all different already,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe grass is greener and\r\nthings are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green\r\nbuds of leaves are showing. This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which\r\nbordered the walk by the lower wall. There were things sprouting and\r\npushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually\r\nhere and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the\r\nstems of crocuses. Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen\r\nhow the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy,\r\nshe was startled by a curious loud sound. It was the caw\xe2\x80\x94caw of a crow\r\nand it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat\r\na big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely\r\nindeed. She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a\r\nlittle nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped\r\naway across the garden. She hoped he was not going to stay inside and\r\nshe pushed the door open wondering if he would. When she got fairly\r\ninto the garden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he\r\nhad alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a\r\nlittle reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were watching\r\nthe stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the\r\ngrass working hard.\r\n\r\nMary flew across the grass to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dickon! Dickon!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could you get here so early!\r\nHow could you! The sun has only just got up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his eyes like a\r\nbit of the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was up long before him. How could I have stayed abed!\r\nTh\xe2\x80\x99 world\xe2\x80\x99s all fair begun again this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, it has. An\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s workin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 hummin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 scratchin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 pipin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 nest-buildin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 breathin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nout scents, till you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be out on it \xe2\x80\x99stead o\xe2\x80\x99 lyin\xe2\x80\x99 on your\r\nback. When th\xe2\x80\x99 sun did jump up, th\xe2\x80\x99 moor went mad for joy, an\xe2\x80\x99 I was in\r\nthe midst of th\xe2\x80\x99 heather, an\xe2\x80\x99 I run like mad myself, shoutin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsingin\xe2\x80\x99. An\xe2\x80\x99 I come straight here. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stayed away. Why,\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 garden was lyin\xe2\x80\x99 here waitin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she had been running\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dickon! Dickon!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so happy I can scarcely breathe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rose\r\nfrom its place under the tree and came to him, and the rook, cawing\r\nonce, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is th\xe2\x80\x99 little fox cub,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rubbing the little reddish\r\nanimal\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s named Captain. An\xe2\x80\x99 this here\xe2\x80\x99s Soot. Soot he flew\r\nacross th\xe2\x80\x99 moor with me an\xe2\x80\x99 Captain he run same as if th\xe2\x80\x99 hounds had\r\nbeen after him. They both felt same as I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of Mary.\r\nWhen Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his shoulder and\r\nCaptain trotted quietly close to his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cSee how these has pushed up, an\xe2\x80\x99 these an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthese! An\xe2\x80\x99 Eh! Look at these here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw himself upon his knees and Mary went down beside him. They had\r\ncome upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and\r\ngold. Mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never kiss a person in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when she lifted her\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cFlowers are so different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked puzzled but smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve kissed mother many a time that way when I come in\r\nfrom th\xe2\x80\x99 moor after a day\xe2\x80\x99s roamin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 she stood there at th\xe2\x80\x99 door in\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 sun, lookin\xe2\x80\x99 so glad an\xe2\x80\x99 comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many\r\nwonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must\r\nwhisper or speak low. He showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches\r\nwhich had seemed dead. He showed her ten thousand new green points\r\npushing through the mould. They put their eager young noses close to\r\nthe earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and\r\npulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary\xe2\x80\x99s hair was as\r\ntumbled as Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his.\r\n\r\nThere was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in\r\nthe midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it\r\nwas more wonderful. Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted\r\nthrough the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of\r\nred-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak. Dickon stood\r\nquite still and put his hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenly\r\nfound themselves laughing in a church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe munnot stir,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered in broad Yorkshire. \xe2\x80\x9cWe munnot scarce\r\nbreathe. I knowed he was mate-huntin\xe2\x80\x99 when I seed him last. It\xe2\x80\x99s Ben\r\nWeatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s robin. He\xe2\x80\x99s buildin\xe2\x80\x99 his nest. He\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here if us\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t flight him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs mustn\xe2\x80\x99t seem as if us was watchin\xe2\x80\x99 him too close,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d be out with us for good if he got th\xe2\x80\x99 notion us was interferin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnow. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good bit different till all this is over. He\xe2\x80\x99s settin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nup housekeepin\xe2\x80\x99. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be shyer an\xe2\x80\x99 readier to take things ill. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot no time for visitin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 gossipin\xe2\x80\x99. Us must keep still a bit an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntry to look as if us was grass an\xe2\x80\x99 trees an\xe2\x80\x99 bushes. Then when he\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nused to seein\xe2\x80\x99 us I\xe2\x80\x99ll chirp a bit an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll know us\xe2\x80\x99ll not be in his\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to,\r\nhow to try to look like grass and trees and bushes. But he had said the\r\nqueer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the\r\nworld, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she\r\nwatched him for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible\r\nfor him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves. But he\r\nonly sat wonderfully still, and when he spoke dropped his voice to such\r\na softness that it was curious that she could hear him, but she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 springtime, this nest-buildin\xe2\x80\x99 is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwarrant it\xe2\x80\x99s been goin\xe2\x80\x99 on in th\xe2\x80\x99 same way every year since th\xe2\x80\x99 world\r\nwas begun. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got their way o\xe2\x80\x99 thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 and doin\xe2\x80\x99 things an\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nbody had better not meddle. You can lose a friend in springtime easier\r\nthan any other season if you\xe2\x80\x99re too curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we talk about him I can\xe2\x80\x99t help looking at him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said as softly\r\nas possible. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must talk of something else. There is something I want\r\nto tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll like it better if us talks o\xe2\x80\x99 somethin\xe2\x80\x99 else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it tha\xe2\x80\x99s got to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94do you know about Colin?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head to look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does tha\xe2\x80\x99 know about him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him. I have been to talk to him every day this week. He\r\nwants me to come. He says I\xe2\x80\x99m making him forget about being ill and\r\ndying,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary.\r\n\r\nDickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from\r\nhis round face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right down glad. It makes me\r\neasier. I knowed I must say nothin\xe2\x80\x99 about him an\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t like havin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto hide things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like hiding the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never tell about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I says to mother,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98I got a secret to keep. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad \xe2\x80\x99un, tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknows that. It\xe2\x80\x99s no worse than hidin\xe2\x80\x99 where a bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest is. Tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, does tha\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary always wanted to hear about mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, not at all afraid to hear.\r\n\r\nDickon grinned sweet-temperedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just like her, what she said,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe give my head a\r\nbit of a rub an\xe2\x80\x99 laughed an\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98Eh, lad, tha\xe2\x80\x99 can have all th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsecrets tha\xe2\x80\x99 likes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve knowed thee twelve year\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know about Colin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little lad\r\nas was like to be a cripple, an\xe2\x80\x99 they knowed Mester Craven didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nhim to be talked about. Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs.\r\nCraven was such a pretty young lady an\xe2\x80\x99 they was so fond of each other.\r\nMrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind talkin\xe2\x80\x99 to mother before us children, because she knows us\r\nhas been brought up to be trusty. How did tha\xe2\x80\x99 find out about him?\r\nMartha was in fine trouble th\xe2\x80\x99 last time she came home. She said tha\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nheard him frettin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 was askin\xe2\x80\x99 questions an\xe2\x80\x99 she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind which\r\nhad wakened her and about the faint far-off sounds of the complaining\r\nvoice which had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and had\r\nended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with the\r\ncarven four-posted bed in the corner. When she described the small\r\nivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem\xe2\x80\x99s just like his mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, only hers was always laughin\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nthey say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say as Mr. Craven can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see him when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s awake an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s because his eyes is so like his mother\xe2\x80\x99s an\xe2\x80\x99 yet\r\nlooks so different in his miserable bit of a face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he wants to die?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but he wishes he\xe2\x80\x99d never been born. Mother she says that\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworst thing on earth for a child. Them as is not wanted scarce ever\r\nthrives. Mester Craven he\xe2\x80\x99d buy anythin\xe2\x80\x99 as money could buy for th\xe2\x80\x99\r\npoor lad but he\xe2\x80\x99d like to forget as he\xe2\x80\x99s on earth. For one thing, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nafraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll look at him some day and find he\xe2\x80\x99s growed hunchback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColin\xe2\x80\x99s so afraid of it himself that he won\xe2\x80\x99t sit up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nsays he\xe2\x80\x99s always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he\r\nshould go crazy and scream himself to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! he oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to lie there thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo lad could get well as thought them sort o\xe2\x80\x99 things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fox was lying on the grass close by him, looking up to ask for a\r\npat now and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly and\r\nthought a few minutes in silence. Presently he lifted his head and\r\nlooked round the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen first we got in here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit seemed like everything was\r\ngray. Look round now and tell me if tha\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary looked and caught her breath a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gray wall is changing. It is as if a green mist\r\nwere creeping over it. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost like a green gauze veil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99ll be greener and greener till th\xe2\x80\x99 gray\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall gone. Can tha\xe2\x80\x99 guess what I was thinkin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was something nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it was\r\nsomething about Colin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 that if he was out here he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be watchin\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nlumps to grow on his back; he\xe2\x80\x99d be watchin\xe2\x80\x99 for buds to break on th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrose-bushes, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99d likely be healthier,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nwonderin\xe2\x80\x99 if us could ever get him in th\xe2\x80\x99 humor to come out here an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlie under th\xe2\x80\x99 trees in his carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wondering that myself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of it almost every time\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered if he could keep a\r\nsecret and I\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered if we could bring him here without anyone\r\nseeing us. I thought perhaps you could push his carriage. The doctor\r\nsaid he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one\r\ndare disobey him. He won\xe2\x80\x99t go out for other people and perhaps they\r\nwill be glad if he will go out with us. He could order the gardeners to\r\nkeep away so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99d be good for him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cUs\xe2\x80\x99d not be thinkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d better never been born. Us\xe2\x80\x99d be just two children watchin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\ngarden grow, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99d be another. Two lads an\xe2\x80\x99 a little lass just\r\nlookin\xe2\x80\x99 on at th\xe2\x80\x99 springtime. I warrant it\xe2\x80\x99d be better than doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been lying in his room so long and he\xe2\x80\x99s always been so afraid of\r\nhis back that it has made him queer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows a good many\r\nthings out of books but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything else. He says he has\r\nbeen too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hates\r\ngardens and gardeners. But he likes to hear about this garden because\r\nit is a secret. I daren\xe2\x80\x99t tell him much but he said he wanted to see\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs\xe2\x80\x99ll have him out here sometime for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cI could push\r\nhis carriage well enough. Has tha\xe2\x80\x99 noticed how th\xe2\x80\x99 robin an\xe2\x80\x99 his mate\r\nhas been workin\xe2\x80\x99 while we\xe2\x80\x99ve been sittin\xe2\x80\x99 here? Look at him perched on\r\nthat branch wonderin\xe2\x80\x99 where it\xe2\x80\x99d be best to put that twig he\xe2\x80\x99s got in\r\nhis beak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head\r\nand looked at him inquiringly, still holding his twig. Dickon spoke to\r\nhim as Ben Weatherstaff did, but Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s tone was one of friendly\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWheres\xe2\x80\x99ever tha\xe2\x80\x99 puts it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 knew how\r\nto build tha\xe2\x80\x99 nest before tha\xe2\x80\x99 came out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 egg. Get on with thee,\r\nlad. Tha\xe2\x80\x99st got no time to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do like to hear you talk to him!\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said, laughing\r\ndelightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cBen Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him, and he\r\nhops about and looks as if he understood every word, and I know he\r\nlikes it. Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have\r\nstones thrown at him than not be noticed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon laughed too and went on talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 knows us won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble thee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the robin. \xe2\x80\x9cUs is near\r\nbein\xe2\x80\x99 wild things ourselves. Us is nest-buildin\xe2\x80\x99 too, bless thee. Look\r\nout tha\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell on us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd though the robin did not answer, because his beak was occupied,\r\nMary knew that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of the\r\ngarden the darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not tell\r\ntheir secret for the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI WON\xe2\x80\x99T!\xe2\x80\x9d SAID MARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThey found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late in\r\nreturning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her\r\nwork that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Colin that I can\xe2\x80\x99t come and see him yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Martha.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very busy in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartha looked rather frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! Miss Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit may put him all out of humor when I tell\r\nhim that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not\r\na self-sacrificing person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cDickon\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for me;\xe2\x80\x9d and she ran\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been.\r\nAlready nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of\r\nthe roses and trees had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought a\r\nspade of his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so that\r\nby this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not\r\nlikely to become a \xe2\x80\x9cgardener\xe2\x80\x99s garden\xe2\x80\x9d it would be a wilderness of\r\ngrowing things before the springtime was over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be apple blossoms an\xe2\x80\x99 cherry blossoms overhead,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickon said,\r\nworking away with all his might. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99ll be peach an\xe2\x80\x99 plum trees\r\nin bloom against th\xe2\x80\x99 walls, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 grass\xe2\x80\x99ll be a carpet o\xe2\x80\x99 flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and\r\nthe robin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of\r\nlightning. Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away\r\nover the tree-tops in the park. Each time he came back and perched near\r\nDickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures,\r\nand Dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin. Once when\r\nDickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew on to\r\nhis shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak. When Mary\r\nwanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a tree and once\r\nhe took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little\r\nnotes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s a good bit stronger than tha\xe2\x80\x99 was,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickon said, looking at her\r\nas she was digging. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to look different, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting fatter and fatter every day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quite exultantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. Martha says my\r\nhair is growing thicker. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t so flat and stringy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays\r\nslanting under the trees when they parted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be at work by sunrise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo will I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nShe ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her. She\r\nwanted to tell Colin about Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s fox cub and the rook and about what\r\nthe springtime had been doing. She felt sure he would like to hear. So\r\nit was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room, to see\r\nMartha standing waiting for her with a doleful face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Colin say when you told him\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish tha\xe2\x80\x99d gone. He was nigh goin\xe2\x80\x99 into one o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhis tantrums. There\xe2\x80\x99s been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him\r\nquiet. He would watch the clock all th\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s lips pinched themselves together. She was no more used to\r\nconsidering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why an\r\nill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best. She\r\nknew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and\r\nnervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and\r\nneed not make other people ill and nervous, too. When she had had a\r\nheadache in India she had done her best to see that everybody else also\r\nhad a headache or something quite as bad. And she felt she was quite\r\nright; but of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong.\r\n\r\nHe was not on his sofa when she went into his room. He was lying flat\r\non his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came\r\nin. This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiff\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you get up?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered, without looking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI made them put me back in bed this\r\nafternoon. My back ached and my head ached and I was tired. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was working in the garden with Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nColin frowned and condescended to look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of\r\ncoming to talk to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMary flew into a fine passion. She could fly into a passion without\r\nmaking a noise. She just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you send Dickon away, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never come into this room again!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to if I want you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cThey shall drag you in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall they, Mr. Rajah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cThey may drag me in but\r\nthey can\xe2\x80\x99t make me talk when they get me here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit and clench my\r\nteeth and never tell you one thing. I won\xe2\x80\x99t even look at you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstare at the floor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other. If they\r\nhad been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other\r\nand had a rough-and-tumble fight. As it was, they did the next thing to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a selfish thing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cSelfish people always say that. Anyone is\r\nselfish who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do what they want. You\xe2\x80\x99re more selfish than I am.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re the most selfish boy I ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not as selfish as your fine Dickon is!\r\nHe keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows I am all by myself. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nselfish, if you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s nicer than any other boy that ever lived!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike an angel!\xe2\x80\x9d It might sound rather silly to say that but she did not\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice angel!\xe2\x80\x9d Colin sneered ferociously. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a common cottage boy\r\noff the moor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s better than a common Rajah!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand\r\ntimes better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBecause she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get the\r\nbetter of him. The truth was that he had never had a fight with anyone\r\nlike himself in his life and, upon the whole, it was rather good for\r\nhim, though neither he nor Mary knew anything about that. He turned his\r\nhead on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out\r\nand ran down his cheek. He was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94not for anyone else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not as selfish as you, because I\xe2\x80\x99m always ill, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\r\nis a lump coming on my back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am going to die besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not!\xe2\x80\x9d contradicted Mary unsympathetically.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. He had never heard such\r\na thing said before. He was at once furious and slightly pleased, if a\r\nperson could be both at one time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI am! You know I am! Everybody says so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary sourly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just say that to make\r\npeople sorry. I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re proud of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it! If you\r\nwere a nice boy it might be true\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99re too nasty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out of the room!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow and\r\nthrew it at her. He was not strong enough to throw it far and it only\r\nfell at her feet, but Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I won\xe2\x80\x99t come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round and\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDickon\r\nbrought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all about\r\nthem. Now I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you a single thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe marched out of the door and closed it behind her, and there to her\r\ngreat astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she had\r\nbeen listening and, more amazing still\xe2\x80\x94she was laughing. She was a big\r\nhandsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all,\r\nas she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses to\r\nleave Colin to Martha or anyone else who would take her place. Mary had\r\nnever liked her, and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood\r\ngiggling into her handkerchief..\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt you two young ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing that\r\ncould happen to the sickly pampered thing to have someone to stand up\r\nto him that\xe2\x80\x99s as spoiled as himself;\xe2\x80\x9d and she laughed into her\r\nhandkerchief again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99d had a young vixen of a sister to fight\r\nwith it would have been the saving of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he going to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cHysterics and temper\r\nare half what ails him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are hysterics?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this\xe2\x80\x94but at any\r\nrate you\xe2\x80\x99ve given him something to have hysterics about, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when she\r\nhad come in from the garden. She was cross and disappointed but not at\r\nall sorry for Colin. She had looked forward to telling him a great many\r\nthings and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be\r\nsafe to trust him with the great secret. She had been beginning to\r\nthink it would be, but now she had changed her mind entirely. She would\r\nnever tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh\r\nair and die if he liked! It would serve him right! She felt so sour and\r\nunrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon and\r\nthe green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down\r\nfrom the moor.\r\n\r\nMartha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been\r\ntemporarily replaced by interest and curiosity. There was a wooden box\r\non the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was\r\nfull of neat packages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Craven sent it to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if it had\r\npicture-books in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want anything\xe2\x80\x94dolls\xe2\x80\x94toys\xe2\x80\x94books?\xe2\x80\x9d She opened the package\r\nwondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should do\r\nwith it if he had. But he had not sent one. There were several\r\nbeautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens\r\nand were full of pictures. There were two or three games and there was\r\na beautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold\r\npen and inkstand.\r\n\r\nEverything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out\r\nof her mind. She had not expected him to remember her at all and her\r\nhard little heart grew quite warm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can write better than I can print,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand the first thing I\r\nshall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am much\r\nobliged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him her\r\npresents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read\r\nsome of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he\r\nwould have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought he\r\nwas going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was\r\na lump coming. He had a way of doing that which she could not bear. It\r\ngave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked\r\nso frightened himself. He said that if he felt even quite a little lump\r\nsome day he should know his hunch had begun to grow. Something he had\r\nheard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and\r\nhe had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his\r\nmind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father\xe2\x80\x99s back had begun to show its\r\ncrookedness in that way when he was a child. He had never told anyone\r\nbut Mary that most of his \xe2\x80\x9ctantrums\xe2\x80\x9d as they called them grew out of\r\nhis hysterical hidden fear. Mary had been sorry for him when he had\r\ntold her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has been cross today. Perhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps he has\r\nbeen thinking about it all afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I would never go back again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she hesitated, knitting her\r\nbrows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see\xe2\x80\x94if he wants me\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe morning. Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll try to throw his pillow at me again, but\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nA TANTRUM\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the\r\ngarden and she was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought\r\nher supper and she had eaten it, she was glad to go to bed. As she laid\r\nher head on the pillow she murmured to herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought it was the middle of the night when she was awakened by\r\nsuch dreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant. What was\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94what was it? The next minute she felt quite sure she knew. Doors\r\nwere opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and\r\nsomeone was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and crying\r\nin a horrible way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Colin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s having one of those tantrums the nurse\r\ncalled hysterics. How awful it sounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that people\r\nwere so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything rather\r\nthan hear them. She put her hands over her ears and felt sick and\r\nshivering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she kept saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then she\r\nremembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought that\r\nperhaps the sight of her might make him worse. Even when she pressed\r\nher hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful\r\nsounds out. She hated them so and was so terrified by them that\r\nsuddenly they began to make her angry and she felt as if she should\r\nlike to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was\r\nfrightening her. She was not used to anyone\xe2\x80\x99s tempers but her own. She\r\ntook her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him stop! Somebody\r\nought to beat him!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out.\r\n\r\nJust then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door\r\nopened and the nurse came in. She was not laughing now by any means.\r\nShe even looked rather pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s worked himself into hysterics,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a great hurry. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo himself harm. No one can do anything with him. You come and try,\r\nlike a good child. He likes you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe turned me out of the room this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, stamping her\r\nfoot with excitement.\r\n\r\nThe stamp rather pleased the nurse. The truth was that she had been\r\nafraid she might find Mary crying and hiding her head under the\r\nbed-clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in the right humor. You go and scold\r\nhim. Give him something new to think of. Do go, child, as quick as ever\r\nyou can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had been\r\nfunny as well as dreadful\xe2\x80\x94that it was funny that all the grown-up\r\npeople were so frightened that they came to a little girl just because\r\nthey guessed she was almost as bad as Colin himself.\r\n\r\nShe flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the\r\nhigher her temper mounted. She felt quite wicked by the time she\r\nreached the door. She slapped it open with her hand and ran across the\r\nroom to the four-posted bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stop!\xe2\x80\x9d she almost shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stop! I hate you! Everybody hates\r\nyou! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream\r\nyourself to death! You _will_ scream yourself to death in a minute, and\r\nI wish you would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such\r\nthings, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the\r\nbest possible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared\r\nto restrain or contradict.\r\n\r\nHe had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he\r\nactually almost jumped around, he turned so quickly at the sound of the\r\nfurious little voice. His face looked dreadful, white and red and\r\nswollen, and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did not\r\ncare an atom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you scream another scream,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll scream too\xe2\x80\x94and I can\r\nscream louder than you can and I\xe2\x80\x99ll frighten you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll frighten you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so. The\r\nscream which had been coming almost choked him. The tears were\r\nstreaming down his face and he shook all over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stop!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped and sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf that ails you is hysterics and\r\ntemper\xe2\x80\x94just hysterics\xe2\x80\x94hysterics\xe2\x80\x94hysterics!\xe2\x80\x9d and she stamped each time\r\nshe said it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt the lump\xe2\x80\x94I felt it,\xe2\x80\x9d choked out Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I should. I\r\nshall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,\xe2\x80\x9d and he began to\r\nwrithe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nscream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel a lump!\xe2\x80\x9d contradicted Mary fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you did it\r\nwas only a hysterical lump. Hysterics makes lumps. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the\r\nmatter with your horrid back\xe2\x80\x94nothing but hysterics! Turn over and let\r\nme look at it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe liked the word \xe2\x80\x9chysterics\xe2\x80\x9d and felt somehow as if it had an effect\r\non him. He was probably like herself and had never heard it before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNurse,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here and show me his back this minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled together\r\nnear the door staring at her, their mouths half open. All three had\r\ngasped with fright more than once. The nurse came forward as if she\r\nwere half afraid. Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x94he won\xe2\x80\x99t let me,\xe2\x80\x9d she hesitated in a low voice.\r\n\r\nColin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two sobs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh-show her! She-she\xe2\x80\x99ll see then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared. Every rib could\r\nbe counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not\r\ncount them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage\r\nlittle face. She looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned\r\nher head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth. There was just a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x99s silence, for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary\r\nlooked up and down his spine, and down and up, as intently as if she\r\nhad been the great doctor from London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a single lump there!\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\nlump as big as a pin\xe2\x80\x94except backbone lumps, and you can only feel them\r\nbecause you\xe2\x80\x99re thin. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got backbone lumps myself, and they used to\r\nstick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am\r\nnot fat enough yet to hide them. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a lump as big as a pin! If\r\nyou ever say there is again, I shall laugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish\r\nwords had on him. If he had ever had anyone to talk to about his secret\r\nterrors\xe2\x80\x94if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions\xe2\x80\x94if he had had\r\nchildish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed\r\nhouse, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were\r\nmost of them ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out that\r\nmost of his fright and illness was created by himself. But he had lain\r\nand thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and days\r\nand months and years. And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl\r\ninsisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was he\r\nactually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d ventured the nurse, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he thought he had a lump on\r\nhis spine. His back is weak because he won\xe2\x80\x99t try to sit up. I could\r\nhave told him there was no lump there.\xe2\x80\x9d Colin gulped and turned his\r\nface a little to look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC-could you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said pathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, and she gulped too.\r\n\r\nColin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn broken\r\nbreaths, which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing, he lay\r\nstill for a minute, though great tears streamed down his face and wet\r\nthe pillow. Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had\r\ncome to him. Presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and\r\nstrangely enough he was not like a Rajah at all as he spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\xe2\x80\x94I could\xe2\x80\x94live to grow up?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could repeat some\r\nof the London doctor\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give\r\nway to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin\xe2\x80\x99s tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying and\r\nthis perhaps made him feel gentle. He put out his hand a little toward\r\nMary, and I am glad to say that, her own tantum having passed, she was\r\nsoftened too and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was a sort\r\nof making up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out with you, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t hate fresh air if\r\nwe can find\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He remembered just in time to stop himself from saying\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif we can find the secret garden\xe2\x80\x9d and he ended, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall like to go\r\nout with you if Dickon will come and push my chair. I do so want to see\r\nDickon and the fox and the crow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the\r\npillows. Then she made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary,\r\nwho really was very glad to get it after her excitement. Mrs. Medlock\r\nand Martha gladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm\r\nand in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away\r\nalso. She was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her\r\nsleep and she yawned quite openly as she looked at Mary, who had pushed\r\nher big footstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go back and get your sleep out,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll drop off\r\nafter a while\xe2\x80\x94if he\xe2\x80\x99s not too upset. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down myself in the\r\nnext room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\r\nwhispered to Colin.\r\n\r\nHis hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on her\r\nappealingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a soft song. I shall go to sleep in\r\na minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will put him to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said to the yawning nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can go\r\nif you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo to sleep in half an hour you must call me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone\r\nColin pulled Mary\xe2\x80\x99s hand again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost told,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I stopped myself in time. I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot of nice things\r\nto tell me. Have you\xe2\x80\x94do you think you have found out anything at all\r\nabout the way into the secret garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her\r\nheart relented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-es,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have. And if you will go to sleep I\r\nwill tell you tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d His hand quite trembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mary! If I could get into it I think I should\r\nlive to grow up! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah\r\nsong\xe2\x80\x94you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you\r\nimagine it looks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cShut your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and began\r\nto speak very slowly and in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it has been left alone so long\xe2\x80\x94that it has grown all into a\r\nlovely tangle. I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed\r\nuntil they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the\r\nground\xe2\x80\x94almost like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died but\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x94are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and\r\nfountains of roses. I think the ground is full of daffodils and\r\nsnowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark. Now\r\nthe spring has begun\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and she\r\nsaw it and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they are coming up through the grass\xe2\x80\x94perhaps there are\r\nclusters of purple crocuses and gold ones\xe2\x80\x94even now. Perhaps the leaves\r\nare beginning to break out and uncurl\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps\xe2\x80\x94the gray is changing\r\nand a green gauze veil is creeping\xe2\x80\x94and creeping over\xe2\x80\x94everything. And\r\nthe birds are coming to look at it\xe2\x80\x94because it is\xe2\x80\x94so safe and still. And\r\nperhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d very softly and slowly indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe robin has\r\nfound a mate\xe2\x80\x94and is building a nest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Colin was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHA\xe2\x80\x99 MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Mary did not waken early the next morning. She slept late\r\nbecause she was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she told\r\nher that though Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he\r\nalways was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying. Mary ate\r\nher breakfast slowly as she listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he wishes tha\xe2\x80\x99 would please go and see him as soon as tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncan,\xe2\x80\x9d Martha said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s queer what a fancy he\xe2\x80\x99s took to thee. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 did\r\ngive it him last night for sure\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t tha? Nobody else would have\r\ndared to do it. Eh! poor lad! He\xe2\x80\x99s been spoiled till salt won\xe2\x80\x99t save\r\nhim. Mother says as th\xe2\x80\x99 two worst things as can happen to a child is\r\nnever to have his own way\xe2\x80\x94or always to have it. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know which\r\nis th\xe2\x80\x99 worst. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 was in a fine temper tha\xe2\x80\x99self, too. But he says to\r\nme when I went into his room, \xe2\x80\x98Please ask Miss Mary if she\xe2\x80\x99ll please\r\ncome an\xe2\x80\x99 talk to me?\xe2\x80\x99 Think o\xe2\x80\x99 him saying please! Will you go, Miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run and see Dickon first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see Colin\r\nfirst and tell him\xe2\x80\x94I know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d with a sudden\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nShe had her hat on when she appeared in Colin\xe2\x80\x99s room and for a second\r\nhe looked disappointed. He was in bed. His face was pitifully white and\r\nthere were dark circles round his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you came,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy head aches and I ache all over\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m so tired. Are you going somewhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary went and leaned against his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be long,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to Dickon, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.\r\nColin, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s something about the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis whole face brightened and a little color came into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cI dreamed about it all night. I heard you\r\nsay something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was\r\nstanding in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthere were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll lie and think about it until you come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden. The fox and the\r\ncrow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came over on the pony this mornin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! he is a good\r\nlittle chap\xe2\x80\x94Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This here one\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s called Nut an\xe2\x80\x99 this here other one\xe2\x80\x99s called Shell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he said \xe2\x80\x9cNut\xe2\x80\x9d one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and\r\nwhen he said \xe2\x80\x9cShell\xe2\x80\x9d the other one leaped on to his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot\r\nsolemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to\r\nthem, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave\r\nsuch delightfulness, but when she began to tell her story somehow the\r\nlook in Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s funny face gradually changed her mind. She could see\r\nhe felt sorrier for Colin than she did. He looked up at the sky and all\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust listen to them birds\xe2\x80\x94th\xe2\x80\x99 world seems full of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94all whistlin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 pipin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at \xe2\x80\x99em dartin\xe2\x80\x99 about, an\xe2\x80\x99 hearken at \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ncallin\xe2\x80\x99 to each other. Come springtime seems like as if all th\xe2\x80\x99 world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncallin\xe2\x80\x99. The leaves is uncurlin\xe2\x80\x99 so you can see \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99, my word, th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnice smells there is about!\xe2\x80\x9d sniffing with his happy turned-up nose.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 that poor lad lyin\xe2\x80\x99 shut up an\xe2\x80\x99 seein\xe2\x80\x99 so little that he gets to\r\nthinkin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 things as sets him screamin\xe2\x80\x99. Eh! my! we mun get him out\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94we mun get him watchin\xe2\x80\x99 an listenin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 sniffin\xe2\x80\x99 up th\xe2\x80\x99 air an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nget him just soaked through wi\xe2\x80\x99 sunshine. An\xe2\x80\x99 we munnot lose no time\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshire\r\nthough at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary could\r\nbetter understand. But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact\r\nbeen trying to learn to speak it herself. So she spoke a little now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that we mun,\xe2\x80\x9d she said (which meant \xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, we must\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee what us\xe2\x80\x99ll do first,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded, and Dickon\r\ngrinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into\r\nspeaking Yorkshire it amused him very much. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s took a graidely fancy\r\nto thee. He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an\xe2\x80\x99 Captain.\r\nWhen I go back to the house to talk to him I\xe2\x80\x99ll ax him if tha\xe2\x80\x99 canna\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncome an\xe2\x80\x99 see him tomorrow mornin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 bring tha\xe2\x80\x99 creatures wi\xe2\x80\x99 thee\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94in a bit, when there\xe2\x80\x99s more leaves out, an\xe2\x80\x99 happen a bud or two,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll get him to come out an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 shall push him in his chair an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him here an\xe2\x80\x99 show him everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she stopped she was quite proud of herself. She had never made a\r\nlong speech in Yorkshire before and she had remembered very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 mun talk a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickon\r\nchuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99ll make him laugh an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s nowt as good for ill folk\r\nas laughin\xe2\x80\x99 is. Mother says she believes as half a hour\xe2\x80\x99s good laugh\r\nevery mornin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ud cure a chap as was makin\xe2\x80\x99 ready for typhus fever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary,\r\nchuckling herself.\r\n\r\nThe garden had reached the time when every day and every night it\r\nseemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out\r\nof the earth and the boughs with wands. It was hard to go away and\r\nleave it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her dress\r\nand Shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under\r\nand stayed there looking at her with inquiring eyes. But she went back\r\nto the house and when she sat down close to Colin\xe2\x80\x99s bed he began to\r\nsniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou smell like flowers and\xe2\x80\x94and fresh things,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out quite\r\njoyously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you smell of? It\xe2\x80\x99s cool and warm and sweet all at\r\nthe same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 wind from th\xe2\x80\x99 moor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt comes o\xe2\x80\x99 sittin\xe2\x80\x99 on th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngrass under a tree wi\xe2\x80\x99 Dickon an\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 Captain an\xe2\x80\x99 Soot an\xe2\x80\x99 Nut an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShell. It\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 springtime an\xe2\x80\x99 out o\xe2\x80\x99 doors an\xe2\x80\x99 sunshine as smells so\r\ngraidely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know how broadly\r\nYorkshire sounds until you have heard someone speak it. Colin began to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard you talk like that\r\nbefore. How funny it sounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m givin\xe2\x80\x99 thee a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 Yorkshire,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncanna\xe2\x80\x99 talk as graidely as Dickon an\xe2\x80\x99 Martha can but tha\xe2\x80\x99 sees I can\r\nshape a bit. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tha\xe2\x80\x99 understand a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 Yorkshire when tha\xe2\x80\x99 hears\r\nit? An\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 a Yorkshire lad thysel\xe2\x80\x99 bred an\xe2\x80\x99 born! Eh! I wonder tha\xe2\x80\x99rt\r\nnot ashamed o\xe2\x80\x99 thy face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could\r\nnot stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs.\r\nMedlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and\r\nstood listening amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, upon my word!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herself\r\nbecause there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever heard th\xe2\x80\x99 like! Whoever on earth would ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was so much to talk about. It seemed as if Colin could never hear\r\nenough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony\r\nwhose name was Jump. Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to\r\nsee Jump. He was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks\r\nhanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet\r\nnose. He was rather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough\r\nand wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been made of steel\r\nsprings. He had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw\r\nDickon and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his\r\nshoulder and then Dickon had talked into his ear and Jump had talked\r\nback in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts. Dickon had made him\r\ngive Mary his small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his\r\nvelvet muzzle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he really understand everything Dickon says?\xe2\x80\x9d Colin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems as if he does,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cDickon says anything will\r\nunderstand if you\xe2\x80\x99re friends with it for sure, but you have to be\r\nfriends for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to be\r\nstaring at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was friends with things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I\r\nnever had anything to be friends with, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you bear me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s funny but I even like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBen Weatherstaff said I was like him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwarrant we\xe2\x80\x99d both got the same nasty tempers. I think you are like him\r\ntoo. We are all three alike\xe2\x80\x94you and I and Ben Weatherstaff. He said we\r\nwere neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked.\r\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and\r\nDickon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you feel as if you hated people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary without any affectation. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have detested\r\nyou if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin put out his thin hand and touched her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said what I did about sending Dickon\r\naway. I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I laughed at\r\nyou but\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was rather funny to say it,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted frankly, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nhis nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have\r\npatches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but\xe2\x80\x94but if an angel\r\ndid come to Yorkshire and live on the moor\xe2\x80\x94if there was a Yorkshire\r\nangel\xe2\x80\x94I believe he\xe2\x80\x99d understand the green things and know how to make\r\nthem grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon\r\ndoes and they\xe2\x80\x99d know he was friends for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Dickon looking at me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you said that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tell\r\nhim. Colin knew something new was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause what?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried eagerly.\r\n\r\nMary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and\r\ncaught hold of both his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him. Can I\r\ntrust you\xe2\x80\x94for sure\xe2\x80\x94_for sure?_\xe2\x80\x9d she implored.\r\n\r\nHer face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring\r\nhis creatures with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Colin cried out in delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It is\r\nunder the ivy on the wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray! Hooray! Hooray!\xe2\x80\x9d but he was weak and rather hysterical; his\r\neyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out with a half sob. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I see it? Shall I get\r\ninto it? Shall I _live_ to get into it?\xe2\x80\x9d and he clutched her hands and\r\ndragged her toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Mary indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlive to get into it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she brought\r\nhim to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes\r\nafterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what she\r\nimagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, and\r\nColin\xe2\x80\x99s aches and tiredness were forgotten and he was listening\r\nenraptured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just what you thought it would be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds\r\njust as if you had really seen it. You know I said that when you told\r\nme first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had seen it\xe2\x80\x94and I had been in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI found the key and got\r\nin weeks ago. But I daren\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\xe2\x80\x94I daren\xe2\x80\x99t because I was so afraid\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust you\xe2\x80\x94_for sure!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIT HAS COME!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning after Colin had had\r\nhis tantrum. He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred\r\nand he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his\r\nbed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into\r\nfresh sobbing at the least word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and\r\ndetested the difficulties of these visits. On this occasion he was away\r\nfrom Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he arrived.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day. The boy is\r\nhalf insane with hysteria and self-indulgence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Medlock, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll scarcely believe your eyes\r\nwhen you see him. That plain sour-faced child that\xe2\x80\x99s almost as bad as\r\nhimself has just bewitched him. How she\xe2\x80\x99s done it there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling.\r\nThe Lord knows she\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her\r\nspeak, but she did what none of us dare do. She just flew at him like a\r\nlittle cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop\r\nscreaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop,\r\nand this afternoon\xe2\x80\x94well just come up and see, sir. It\xe2\x80\x99s past\r\ncrediting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient\xe2\x80\x99s room\r\nwas indeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs. Medlock opened the door\r\nhe heard laughing and chattering. Colin was on his sofa in his\r\ndressing-gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture\r\nin one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that\r\nmoment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was so\r\nglowing with enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose long spires of blue ones\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot of those,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin was\r\nannouncing. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re called Del-phin-iums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDickon says they\xe2\x80\x99re larkspurs made big and grand,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mistress\r\nMary. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are clumps there already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite still and Colin\r\nlooked fretful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Craven said a\r\ntrifle nervously. He was rather a nervous man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m better now\xe2\x80\x94much better,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin answered, rather like a Rajah. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine. I want some fresh\r\nair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be a very fine day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you must be very careful\r\nnot to tire yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFresh air won\xe2\x80\x99t tire me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Rajah.\r\n\r\nAs there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked\r\naloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold and\r\nkill him, it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat\r\nstartled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you did not like fresh air,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t when I am by myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Rajah; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my cousin is\r\ngoing out with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the nurse, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Dr. Craven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not have the nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d so magnificently that Mary could not\r\nhelp remembering how the young native Prince had looked with his\r\ndiamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great\r\nrubies on the small dark hand he had waved to command his servants to\r\napproach with salaams and receive his orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin knows how to take care of me. I am always better when she is\r\nwith me. She made me better last night. A very strong boy I know will\r\npush my carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy should\r\nchance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheriting\r\nMisselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak\r\none, and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be a strong boy and a steady boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must know\r\nsomething about him. Who is he? What is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary spoke up suddenly. She felt somehow that everybody\r\nwho knew the moor must know Dickon. And she was right, too. She saw\r\nthat in a moment Dr. Craven\xe2\x80\x99s serious face relaxed into a relieved\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is Dickon you will be safe enough. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s trusty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 trustiest lad i\xe2\x80\x99 Yorkshire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe had been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she forgot herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Dickon teach you that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m learning it as if it was French,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary rather coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike a native dialect in India. Very clever people try to learn them. I\r\nlike it and so does Colin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it amuses you perhaps it won\xe2\x80\x99t do you any\r\nharm. Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it at first and after Mary made\r\nme quiet she talked me to sleep\xe2\x80\x94in a low voice\xe2\x80\x94about the spring\r\ncreeping into a garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds soothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever and\r\nglancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking\r\ndown silently at the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are evidently better, but you must\r\nremember\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to remember,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Rajah, appearing again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and\r\nI think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so.\r\nIf there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill\r\ninstead of remembering it I would have him brought here.\xe2\x80\x9d And he waved\r\na thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet\r\nrings made of rubies. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because my cousin makes me forget that she\r\nmakes me better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a \xe2\x80\x9ctantrum\xe2\x80\x9d; usually\r\nhe was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.\r\nThis afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and\r\nhe was spared any disagreeable scenes. When he went downstairs he\r\nlooked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the\r\nlibrary she felt that he was a much puzzled man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she ventured, \xe2\x80\x9ccould you have believed it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certainly a new state of affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno denying it is better than the old one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe Susan Sowerby\xe2\x80\x99s right\xe2\x80\x94I do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nstopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit of\r\ntalk with her. And she says to me, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be a\r\ngood child, an\xe2\x80\x99 she mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be a pretty one, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a child, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nchildren needs children.\xe2\x80\x99 We went to school together, Susan Sowerby and\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the best sick nurse I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Craven. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I find her\r\nin a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock smiled. She was fond of Susan Sowerby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got a way with her, has Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on quite volubly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday. She says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once when I was givin\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 children a bit of a preach after they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen fightin\xe2\x80\x99 I ses to \xe2\x80\x99em all, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was at school my jography told\r\nas th\xe2\x80\x99 world was shaped like a orange an\xe2\x80\x99 I found out before I was ten\r\nthat th\xe2\x80\x99 whole orange doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to nobody. No one owns more than\r\nhis bit of a quarter an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s times it seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s not enow\r\nquarters to go round. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94none o\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x94think as you own th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhole orange or you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out you\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken, an\xe2\x80\x99 you won\xe2\x80\x99t find it\r\nout without hard knocks.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98What children learns from children,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in grabbin\xe2\x80\x99 at th\xe2\x80\x99 whole orange\xe2\x80\x94peel\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 all. If you do you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely not get even th\xe2\x80\x99 pips, an\xe2\x80\x99 them\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nbitter to eat.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a shrewd woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s got a way of saying things,\xe2\x80\x9d ended Mrs. Medlock, much\r\npleased. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to her, \xe2\x80\x98Eh! Susan, if you was a\r\ndifferent woman an\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk such broad Yorkshire I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the\r\ntimes when I should have said you was clever.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened his\r\neyes in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it\xe2\x80\x94smiled\r\nbecause he felt so curiously comfortable. It was actually nice to be\r\nawake, and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He felt\r\nas if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and let\r\nhim go. He did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his nerves\r\nhad relaxed and rested themselves. Instead of lying and staring at the\r\nwall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of the plans he\r\nand Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon\r\nand his wild creatures. It was so nice to have things to think about.\r\nAnd he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet\r\nrunning along the corridor and Mary was at the door. The next minute\r\nshe was in the room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a\r\nwaft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been out! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been out! There\xe2\x80\x99s that nice smell of leaves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe cried.\r\n\r\nShe had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was\r\nbright with the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little breathless with her speed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nnever saw anything so beautiful! It has _come!_ I thought it had come\r\nthat other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has\r\ncome, the Spring! Dickon says so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing about it he\r\nfelt his heart beat. He actually sat up in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the window!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, laughing half with joyful excitement and\r\nhalf at his own fancy. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we may hear golden trumpets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in a\r\nmoment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents\r\nand birds\xe2\x80\x99 songs were pouring through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s fresh air,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLie on your back and draw in long\r\nbreaths of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s what Dickon does when he\xe2\x80\x99s lying on the moor. He\r\nsays he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as\r\nif he could live forever and ever. Breathe it and breathe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she caught Colin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Forever and ever\xe2\x80\x99! Does it make him feel like that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and he\r\ndid as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over again\r\nuntil he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMary was at his bedside again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings are crowding up out of the earth,\xe2\x80\x9d she ran on in a hurry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthere are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil\r\nhas covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about\r\ntheir nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even\r\nfighting for places in the secret garden. And the rose-bushes look as\r\nwick as wick can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods,\r\nand the seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the\r\ncrow and the squirrels and a new-born lamb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon had found\r\nthree days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on\r\nthe moor. It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew\r\nwhat to do with it. He had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his\r\njacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm\r\nmilk. It was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs\r\nrather long for its body. Dickon had carried it over the moor in his\r\narms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel, and when\r\nMary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she\r\nhad felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak. A lamb\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlamb! A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!\r\n\r\nShe was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and\r\ndrawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered. She started a\r\nlittle at the sight of the open window. She had sat stifling in the\r\nroom many a warm day because her patient was sure that open windows\r\ngave people cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI am breathing long breaths of fresh air. It\r\nmakes you strong. I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast. My\r\ncousin will have breakfast with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for two\r\nbreakfasts. She found the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall a more amusing place than the\r\ninvalid\xe2\x80\x99s chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from\r\nupstairs. There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young\r\nrecluse who, as the cook said, \xe2\x80\x9chad found his master, and good for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d The servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the\r\nbutler, who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his\r\nopinion that the invalid would be all the better \xe2\x80\x9cfor a good hiding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the\r\ntable he made an announcement to the nurse in his most Rajah-like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb,\r\nare coming to see me this morning. I want them brought upstairs as soon\r\nas they come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to begin playing with the animals\r\nin the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall and keep them there. I want them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what you can do,\xe2\x80\x9d added Colin, waving his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\ntell Martha to bring them here. The boy is Martha\xe2\x80\x99s brother. His name\r\nis Dickon and he is an animal charmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the animals won\xe2\x80\x99t bite, Master Colin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you he was a charmer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin austerely. \xe2\x80\x9cCharmers\xe2\x80\x99 animals\r\nnever bite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are snake-charmers in India,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they can put their\r\nsnakes\xe2\x80\x99 heads in their mouths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness!\xe2\x80\x9d shuddered the nurse.\r\n\r\nThey ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.\r\nColin\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him with serious\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will begin to get fatter just as I did,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never wanted\r\nmy breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted mine this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it was the fresh\r\nair. When do you think Dickon will come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not long in coming. In about ten minutes Mary held up her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear a caw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hear\r\ninside a house, a hoarse \xe2\x80\x9ccaw-caw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Soot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cListen again. Do you hear a bleat\xe2\x80\x94a tiny\r\none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin, quite flushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the new-born lamb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon\xe2\x80\x99s moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried to\r\nwalk quietly they made a clumping sound as he walked through the long\r\ncorridors. Mary and Colin heard him marching\xe2\x80\x94marching, until he passed\r\nthrough the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin\xe2\x80\x99s own passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Martha, opening the door, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nplease, sir, here\xe2\x80\x99s Dickon an\xe2\x80\x99 his creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile. The new-born lamb was in\r\nhis arms and the little red fox trotted by his side. Nut sat on his\r\nleft shoulder and Soot on his right and Shell\xe2\x80\x99s head and paws peeped\r\nout of his coat pocket.\r\n\r\nColin slowly sat up and stared and stared\xe2\x80\x94as he had stared when he\r\nfirst saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight. The truth\r\nwas that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least\r\nunderstood what this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow\r\nand his squirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness\r\nthat they seemed almost to be part of himself. Colin had never talked\r\nto a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure and\r\ncuriosity that he did not even think of speaking.\r\n\r\nBut Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. He had not felt\r\nembarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had only\r\nstared and had not spoken to him the first time they met. Creatures\r\nwere always like that until they found out about you. He walked over to\r\nColin\xe2\x80\x99s sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his lap, and\r\nimmediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gown\r\nand began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curled\r\nhead with soft impatience against his side. Of course no boy could have\r\nhelped speaking then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it doing?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wants its mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon, smiling more and more. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought\r\nit to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it feed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, little \xe2\x80\x99un,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning the small woolly white head\r\nwith a gentle brown hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what tha\xe2\x80\x99s after. Tha\xe2\x80\x99ll get more\r\nout o\xe2\x80\x99 this than tha\xe2\x80\x99 will out o\xe2\x80\x99 silk velvet coats. There now,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\npushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the\r\nlamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was no wondering what to say. By the time the lamb\r\nfell asleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all. He\r\ntold them how he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three\r\nmornings ago. He had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark\r\nand watching him swing higher and higher into the sky until he was only\r\na speck in the heights of blue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d almost lost him but for his song an\xe2\x80\x99 I was wonderin\xe2\x80\x99 how a chap\r\ncould hear it when it seemed as if he\xe2\x80\x99d get out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 world in a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 just then I heard somethin\xe2\x80\x99 else far off among th\xe2\x80\x99 gorse\r\nbushes. It was a weak bleatin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 I knowed it was a new lamb as was\r\nhungry an\xe2\x80\x99 I knowed it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hungry if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t lost its mother\r\nsomehow, so I set off searchin\xe2\x80\x99. Eh! I did have a look for it. I went\r\nin an\xe2\x80\x99 out among th\xe2\x80\x99 gorse bushes an\xe2\x80\x99 round an\xe2\x80\x99 round an\xe2\x80\x99 I always\r\nseemed to take th\xe2\x80\x99 wrong turnin\xe2\x80\x99. But at last I seed a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 white by\r\na rock on top o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 moor an\xe2\x80\x99 I climbed up an\xe2\x80\x99 found th\xe2\x80\x99 little \xe2\x80\x99un\r\nhalf dead wi\xe2\x80\x99 cold an\xe2\x80\x99 clemmin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and\r\ncawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions\r\ninto the big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored\r\nbranches. Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nThey looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew all\r\nthe flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were\r\nalready growing in the secret garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldna\xe2\x80\x99 say that there name,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to one under which\r\nwas written \xe2\x80\x9cAquilegia,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbut us calls that a columbine, an\xe2\x80\x99 that there\r\none it\xe2\x80\x99s a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these is\r\ngarden ones an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re bigger an\xe2\x80\x99 grander. There\xe2\x80\x99s some big clumps o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncolumbine in th\xe2\x80\x99 garden. They\xe2\x80\x99ll look like a bed o\xe2\x80\x99 blue an\xe2\x80\x99 white\r\nbutterflies flutterin\xe2\x80\x99 when they\xe2\x80\x99re out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to see them,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to see them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that tha\xe2\x80\x99 mun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary quite seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 munnot lose\r\nno time about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI SHALL LIVE FOREVER\xe2\x80\x94AND EVER\xe2\x80\x94AND EVER!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came\r\nsome very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which\r\ntwo things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him\r\ninto a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning\r\nto do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes,\r\nto talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and\r\nhedges and on the borders of streams. The things he had to tell about\r\notters\xe2\x80\x99 and badgers\xe2\x80\x99 and water-rats\xe2\x80\x99 houses, not to mention birds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost\r\ntremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an\r\nanimal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety\r\nthe whole busy underworld was working.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re same as us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon, \xe2\x80\x9conly they have to build their homes\r\nevery year. An\xe2\x80\x99 it keeps \xe2\x80\x99em so busy they fair scuffle to get \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made\r\nbefore Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the\r\ngarden. No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after\r\nthey turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk\r\noutside the ivied walls. As each day passed, Colin had become more and\r\nmore fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was\r\none of its greatest charms. Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever\r\nsuspect that they had a secret. People must think that he was simply\r\ngoing out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object\r\nto their looking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks about\r\ntheir route. They would go up this path and down that one and cross the\r\nother and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were\r\nlooking at the \xe2\x80\x9cbedding-out plants\xe2\x80\x9d the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had\r\nbeen having arranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do that\r\nno one would think it at all mysterious. They would turn into the\r\nshrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls.\r\nIt was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of\r\nmarch made by great generals in time of war.\r\n\r\nRumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the\r\ninvalid\xe2\x80\x99s apartments had of course filtered through the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall\r\ninto the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding\r\nthis, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from\r\nMaster Colin\xe2\x80\x99s room to the effect that he must report himself in the\r\napartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to\r\nspeak to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be looked at\r\ncalling up a man he\xe2\x80\x99s never set eyes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a glimpse\r\nof the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny\r\nlooks and ways and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard oftenest\r\nwas that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous\r\nfanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by\r\npeople who had never seen him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock, as\r\nshe led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened\r\nthe hitherto mysterious chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hope they\xe2\x80\x99re changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t well change for the worse,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued; \xe2\x80\x9cand queer as\r\nit all is there\xe2\x80\x99s them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand\r\nup under. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in\r\nthe middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby\xe2\x80\x99s Dickon more at home than\r\nyou or me could ever be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately\r\nbelieved. When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it\xe2\x80\x99s not impudence, either. He\xe2\x80\x99s just fine, is that\r\nlad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been\r\nstartled. When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed\r\nquite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the\r\nentrance of a visitor by saying \xe2\x80\x9cCaw\xe2\x80\x94Caw\xe2\x80\x9d quite loudly. In spite of\r\nMrs. Medlock\xe2\x80\x99s warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficiently\r\nundignified to jump backward.\r\n\r\nThe young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa. He was sitting in\r\nan armchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in\r\nfeeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle. A\r\nsquirrel was perched on Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s bent back attentively nibbling a nut.\r\nThe little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\nThe young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over\xe2\x80\x94at least that was\r\nwhat the head gardener felt happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are Roach, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI sent for you to give you some\r\nvery important orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Roach, wondering if he was to receive\r\ninstructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the\r\norchards into water-gardens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going out in my chair this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the fresh\r\nair agrees with me I may go out every day. When I go, none of the\r\ngardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls. No\r\none is to be there. I shall go out about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock and everyone must\r\nkeep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the\r\noaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, turning to her, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is that thing you say in\r\nIndia when you have finished talking and want people to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say, \xe2\x80\x98You have my permission to go,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my permission to go, Roach,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, remember, this is\r\nvery important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaw\xe2\x80\x94Caw!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir. Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock took\r\nhim out of the room.\r\n\r\nOutside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he smiled\r\nuntil he almost laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s got a fine lordly way with him, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d think he was a whole Royal Family rolled into one\xe2\x80\x94Prince Consort\r\nand all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mrs. Medlock, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve had to let him trample all over\r\neveryone of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s what folks\r\nwas born for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll grow out of it, if he lives,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Roach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing pretty sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he does\r\nlive and that Indian child stays here I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant she teaches him that\r\nthe whole orange does not belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says. And\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all safe now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this afternoon I shall see it\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nafternoon I shall be in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon went back to the garden with his creatures and Mary stayed with\r\nColin. She did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet before\r\ntheir lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it. She\r\nwondered why and asked him about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat big eyes you\xe2\x80\x99ve got, Colin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are thinking\r\nthey get as big as saucers. What are you thinking about now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking about what it will look like,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe garden?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe springtime,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking that I\xe2\x80\x99ve really never seen\r\nit before. I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked at\r\nit. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw it in India because there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nShut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin had more imagination\r\nthan she had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking at\r\nwonderful books and pictures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat morning when you ran in and said \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s come! It\xe2\x80\x99s come!\xe2\x80\x99, you\r\nmade me feel quite queer. It sounded as if things were coming with a\r\ngreat procession and big bursts and wafts of music. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a picture like\r\nit in one of my books\xe2\x80\x94crowds of lovely people and children with\r\ngarlands and branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing and\r\ndancing and crowding and playing on pipes. That was why I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets\xe2\x80\x99 and told you to throw open the\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow funny!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s really just what it feels like. And if\r\nall the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild\r\ncreatures danced past at once, what a crowd it would be! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable but\r\nbecause they both so liked it.\r\n\r\nA little later the nurse made Colin ready. She noticed that instead of\r\nlying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made some\r\nefforts to help himself, and he talked and laughed with Mary all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of his good days, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Dr. Craven, who\r\ndropped in to inspect him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in such good spirits that it makes him\r\nstronger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call in again later in the afternoon, after he has come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDr. Craven. \xe2\x80\x9cI must see how the going out agrees with him. I wish,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\na very low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he would let you go with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here\r\nwhile it\xe2\x80\x99s suggested,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the nurse. With sudden firmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really decided to suggest it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, with his\r\nslight nervousness. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll try the experiment. Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s a lad I\xe2\x80\x99d trust\r\nwith a new-born child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strongest footman in the house carried Colin downstairs and put him\r\nin his wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside. After the\r\nmanservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his hand\r\nto him and to the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my permission to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and they both disappeared\r\nquickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely inside\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nDickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily. Mistress\r\nMary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his face to the\r\nsky. The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed\r\nlike white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal\r\nblueness. The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was\r\nstrange with a wild clear scented sweetness. Colin kept lifting his\r\nthin chest to draw it in, and his big eyes looked as if it were they\r\nwhich were listening\xe2\x80\x94listening, instead of his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that scent the puffs of wind bring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gorse on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor that\xe2\x80\x99s openin\xe2\x80\x99 out,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbees are at it wonderful today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took.\r\nIn fact every gardener or gardener\xe2\x80\x99s lad had been witched away. But\r\nthey wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the\r\nfountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere\r\nmysterious pleasure of it. But when at last they turned into the Long\r\nWalk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made\r\nthem, for some curious reason they could not have explained, begin to\r\nspeak in whispers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is it,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is where I used to walk up and down\r\nand wonder and wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin, and his eyes began to search the ivy with eager\r\ncuriousness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can see nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\nThen there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\nA few yards more and Mary whispered again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where the robin flew over the wall,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I wish he\xe2\x80\x99d come again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilac\r\nbush, \xe2\x80\x9cis where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me\r\nthe key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Colin sat up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where? There?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and his eyes were as big as the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark on\r\nthem. Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nwhere I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the\r\nwall. And this is the ivy the wind blew back,\xe2\x80\x9d and she took hold of the\r\nhanging green curtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! is it\xe2\x80\x94is it!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is the handle, and here is the door. Dickon push him in\xe2\x80\x94push\r\nhim in quickly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.\r\n\r\nBut Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though\r\nhe gasped with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and\r\nheld them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the\r\nchair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed. Not till then did\r\nhe take them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary\r\nhad done. And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and\r\ntendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in\r\nthe grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and\r\nthere everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white\r\nand the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were\r\nfluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and\r\nscents. And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely\r\ntouch. And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him. He looked\r\nso strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually\r\ncrept all over him\xe2\x80\x94ivory face and neck and hands and all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall get well! I shall get well!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cMary! Dickon! I\r\nshall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nBEN WEATHERSTAFF\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only\r\nnow and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever\r\nand ever. One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn\r\ndawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one\xe2\x80\x99s head far back\r\nand looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and\r\nflushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost\r\nmakes one cry out and one\xe2\x80\x99s heart stands still at the strange\r\nunchanging majesty of the rising of the sun\xe2\x80\x94which has been happening\r\nevery morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One\r\nknows it then for a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one\r\nstands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold\r\nstillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying\r\nslowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much\r\none tries. Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night\r\nwith millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and\r\nsometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look\r\nin someone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt\r\nthe Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden. That\r\nafternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and\r\nradiantly beautiful and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly\r\ngoodness the spring came and crowded everything it possibly could into\r\nthat one place. More than once Dickon paused in what he was doing and\r\nstood still with a sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! it is graidely,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m twelve goin\xe2\x80\x99 on thirteen an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I\r\nnever seed one as graidely as this \xe2\x80\x99ere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, it is a graidely one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, and she sighed for mere joy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant it\xe2\x80\x99s the graidelest one as ever was in this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes tha\xe2\x80\x99 think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin with dreamy carefulness, \xe2\x80\x9cas happen it\r\nwas made loike this \xe2\x80\x99ere all o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary admiringly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 good\r\nYorkshire. Tha\xe2\x80\x99rt shapin\xe2\x80\x99 first-rate\xe2\x80\x94that tha\xe2\x80\x99 art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd delight reigned.\r\n\r\nThey drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with\r\nblossoms and musical with bees. It was like a king\xe2\x80\x99s canopy, a fairy\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s. There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose\r\nbuds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide.\r\nBetween the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked\r\ndown like wonderful eyes.\r\n\r\nMary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them.\r\nThey brought him things to look at\xe2\x80\x94buds which were opening, buds which\r\nwere tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green,\r\nthe feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty\r\nshell of some bird early hatched. Dickon pushed the chair slowly round\r\nand round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him look at\r\nwonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees. It was\r\nlike being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen\r\nand shown all the mysterious riches it contained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if we shall see the robin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99ll see him often enow after a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen th\xe2\x80\x99\r\neggs hatches out th\xe2\x80\x99 little chap he\xe2\x80\x99ll be kep\xe2\x80\x99 so busy it\xe2\x80\x99ll make his\r\nhead swim. Tha\xe2\x80\x99ll see him flyin\xe2\x80\x99 backward an\xe2\x80\x99 for\xe2\x80\x99ard carryin\xe2\x80\x99 worms\r\nnigh as big as himsel\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 that much noise goin\xe2\x80\x99 on in th\xe2\x80\x99 nest when he\r\ngets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth\r\nto drop th\xe2\x80\x99 first piece in. An\xe2\x80\x99 gapin\xe2\x80\x99 beaks an\xe2\x80\x99 squawks on every side.\r\nMother says as when she sees th\xe2\x80\x99 work a robin has to keep them gapin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeaks filled, she feels like she was a lady with nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to do. She\r\nsays she\xe2\x80\x99s seen th\xe2\x80\x99 little chaps when it seemed like th\xe2\x80\x99 sweat must be\r\ndroppin\xe2\x80\x99 off \xe2\x80\x99em, though folk can\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover\r\ntheir mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard.\r\nColin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices\r\nseveral days before. He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his\r\nbest, but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult\r\nnever to laugh above a whisper.\r\n\r\nEvery moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the\r\nsunshine grew more golden. The wheeled chair had been drawn back under\r\nthe canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out\r\nhis pipe when Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very old tree over there, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nDickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there\r\nwas a brief moment of stillness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had a very gentle\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nMary gazed at the tree and thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe branches are quite gray and there\xe2\x80\x99s not a single leaf anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nColin went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite dead, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cBut them roses as has climbed all over it will\r\nnear hide every bit o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 dead wood when they\xe2\x80\x99re full o\xe2\x80\x99 leaves an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nflowers. It won\xe2\x80\x99t look dead then. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be th\xe2\x80\x99 prettiest of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary still gazed at the tree and thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if a big branch had been broken off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder how it was done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been done many a year,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d with a sudden\r\nrelieved start and laying his hand on Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at that robin! There\r\nhe is! He\xe2\x80\x99s been foragin\xe2\x80\x99 for his mate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of\r\nred-breasted bird with something in his beak. He darted through the\r\ngreenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colin\r\nleaned back on his cushion again, laughing a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s taking her tea to her. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I think I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike some tea myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so they were safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Magic which sent the robin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary secretly to Dickon\r\nafterward. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it was Magic.\xe2\x80\x9d For both she and Dickon had been\r\nafraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken\r\noff ten years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon had\r\nstood and rubbed his head in a troubled way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mun look as if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no different from th\xe2\x80\x99 other trees,\xe2\x80\x9d he had\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t never tell him how it broke, poor lad. If he says\r\nanything about it we mun\xe2\x80\x94we mun try to look cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that we mun,\xe2\x80\x9d had answered Mary.\r\n\r\nBut she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the\r\ntree. She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any\r\nreality in that other thing Dickon had said. He had gone on rubbing his\r\nrust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to\r\ngrow in his blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he had gone on rather\r\nhesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 mother she thinks maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s about Misselthwaite\r\nmany a time lookin\xe2\x80\x99 after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re took out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 world. They have to come back, tha\xe2\x80\x99 sees.\r\nHappen she\xe2\x80\x99s been in the garden an\xe2\x80\x99 happen it was her set us to work,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 told us to bring him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was a great\r\nbeliever in Magic. Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked\r\nMagic, of course good Magic, on everything near him and that was why\r\npeople liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend.\r\nShe wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had brought\r\nthe robin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous\r\nquestion. She felt that his Magic was working all the afternoon and\r\nmaking Colin look like an entirely different boy. It did not seem\r\npossible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and\r\nbeaten and bitten his pillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to\r\nchange. The faint glow of color which had shown on his face and neck\r\nand hands when he first got inside the garden really never quite died\r\naway. He looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax.\r\n\r\nThey saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times, and it\r\nwas so suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the\r\nrhododendron walk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you and Dickon can bring it\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth\r\nwas spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and\r\ncrumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on\r\ndomestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into\r\ninvestigating crumbs with great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up\r\ntrees with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered\r\ncrumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and\r\nmade hoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all\r\njoyfully in one gulp.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour. The sun was\r\ndeepening the gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the\r\nbirds were flying past less often. Dickon and Mary were sitting on the\r\ngrass, the tea-basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house,\r\nand Colin was lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed\r\nback from his forehead and his face looking quite a natural color.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want this afternoon to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall come back\r\ntomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get plenty of fresh air, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the spring now\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see the summer. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to see everything grow here.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to grow here myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat tha\xe2\x80\x99 will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cUs\xe2\x80\x99ll have thee walkin\xe2\x80\x99 about here an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndiggin\xe2\x80\x99 same as other folk afore long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin flushed tremendously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDig! Shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon\xe2\x80\x99s glance at him was delicately cautious. Neither he nor Mary had\r\never asked if anything was the matter with his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor sure tha\xe2\x80\x99 will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x94tha\xe2\x80\x99s got legs o\xe2\x80\x99 thine\r\nown, same as other folks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was rather frightened until she heard Colin\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing really ails them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they are so thin and weak.\r\nThey shake so that I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to try to stand on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen tha\xe2\x80\x99 stops bein\xe2\x80\x99 afraid tha\xe2\x80\x99lt stand on \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickon said with\r\nrenewed cheer. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99lt stop bein\xe2\x80\x99 afraid in a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall?\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, and he lay still as if he were wondering about\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThey were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was dropping\r\nlower. It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they really\r\nhad had a busy and exciting afternoon. Colin looked as if he were\r\nresting luxuriously. Even the creatures had ceased moving about and had\r\ndrawn together and were resting near them. Soot had perched on a low\r\nbranch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his\r\neyes. Mary privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin half\r\nlifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan!\xe2\x80\x9d they both cried in low quick voices.\r\n\r\nColin pointed to the high wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cJust look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder!\r\nHe actually shook his fist at Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bachelder, an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 was a wench o\xe2\x80\x99 mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive thee a hidin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energetic\r\nintention to jump down and deal with her; but as she came toward him he\r\nevidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his ladder\r\nshaking his fist down at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thowt much o\xe2\x80\x99 thee!\xe2\x80\x9d he harangued. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldna\xe2\x80\x99 abide thee th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfirst time I set eyes on thee. A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom,\r\nallus askin\xe2\x80\x99 questions an\xe2\x80\x99 pokin\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 nose where it wasna, wanted. I\r\nnever knowed how tha\xe2\x80\x99 got so thick wi\xe2\x80\x99 me. If it hadna\xe2\x80\x99 been for th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrobin\xe2\x80\x94 Drat him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBen Weatherstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Mary, finding her breath. She stood\r\nbelow him and called up to him with a sort of gasp. \xe2\x80\x9cBen Weatherstaff,\r\nit was the robin who showed me the way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of\r\nthe wall, he was so outraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 young bad \xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d he called down at her. \xe2\x80\x9cLayin\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 badness on a\r\nrobin\xe2\x80\x94not but what he\xe2\x80\x99s impidint enow for anythin\xe2\x80\x99. Him showin\xe2\x80\x99 thee\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 way! Him! Eh! tha\xe2\x80\x99 young nowt\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she could see his next words burst\r\nout because he was overpowered by curiosity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chowever i\xe2\x80\x99 this world did\r\ntha\xe2\x80\x99 get in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the robin who showed me the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested obstinately.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was doing it but he did. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you from\r\nhere while you\xe2\x80\x99re shaking your fist at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and his\r\njaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he saw\r\ncoming over the grass toward him.\r\n\r\nAt the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprised\r\nthat he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But in\r\nthe midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to\r\nDickon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWheel me over there!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cWheel me quite close and stop\r\nright in front of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which\r\nmade his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes\r\nwhich came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach\r\nbecause a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great\r\nblack-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him.\r\nAnd it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s nose. It was really no\r\nwonder his mouth dropped open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the Rajah.\r\n\r\nHow Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on what\r\nwas before him as if he were seeing a ghost. He gazed and gazed and\r\ngulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Colin still more imperiously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his eyes\r\nand over his forehead and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho tha\xe2\x80\x99 art?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, that I do\xe2\x80\x94wi\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes starin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nat me out o\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 face. Lord knows how tha\xe2\x80\x99 come here. But tha\xe2\x80\x99rt th\xe2\x80\x99\r\npoor cripple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin forgot that he had ever had a back. His face flushed scarlet and\r\nhe sat bolt upright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a cripple!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her fierce\r\nindignation. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not got a lump as big as a pin! I looked and there\r\nwas none there\xe2\x80\x94not one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as\r\nif he could never gaze enough. His hand shook and his mouth shook and\r\nhis voice shook. He was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and\r\nhe could only remember the things he had heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94tha\xe2\x80\x99 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a crooked back?\xe2\x80\x9d he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94tha\xe2\x80\x99 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got crooked legs?\xe2\x80\x9d quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.\r\n\r\nIt was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw into his\r\ntantrums rushed through him now in a new way. Never yet had he been\r\naccused of crooked legs\xe2\x80\x94even in whispers\xe2\x80\x94and the perfectly simple\r\nbelief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice was more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure. His anger and\r\ninsulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment and\r\nfilled him with a power he had never known before, an almost unnatural\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began to tear the\r\ncoverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here! Come\r\nhere! This minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon was by his side in a second. Mary caught her breath in a short\r\ngasp and felt herself turn pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can do it! He can do it! He can do it! He can!\xe2\x80\x9d she gabbled over to\r\nherself under her breath as fast as ever she could.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on the ground,\r\nDickon held Colin\xe2\x80\x99s arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feet were on\r\nthe grass. Colin was standing upright\xe2\x80\x94upright\xe2\x80\x94as straight as an arrow\r\nand looking strangely tall\xe2\x80\x94his head thrown back and his strange eyes\r\nflashing lightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me!\xe2\x80\x9d he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. \xe2\x80\x9cJust look at me\xe2\x80\x94you!\r\nJust look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s as straight as I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s as straight as any lad\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 Yorkshire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He choked\r\nand gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled cheeks as\r\nhe struck his old hands together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst forth, \xe2\x80\x9cth\xe2\x80\x99 lies folk tells! Tha\xe2\x80\x99rt as thin as a lath\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 as white as a wraith, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not a knob on thee. Tha\xe2\x80\x99lt make a\r\nmon yet. God bless thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon held Colin\xe2\x80\x99s arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter.\r\nHe stood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m your master,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen my father is away. And you are to\r\nobey me. This is my garden. Don\xe2\x80\x99t dare to say a word about it! You get\r\ndown from that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will\r\nmeet you and bring you here. I want to talk to you. We did not want\r\nyou, but now you will have to be in the secret. Be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s crabbed old face was still wet with that one queer\r\nrush of tears. It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin\r\nstraight Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he almost whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d And then remembering\r\nhimself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nsir! Yes, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nWHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and meet him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and Mary flew across the grass to the door\r\nunder the ivy.\r\n\r\nDickon was watching him with sharp eyes. There were scarlet spots on\r\nhis cheeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can stand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and his head was still held up and he said it\r\nquite grandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told thee tha\xe2\x80\x99 could as soon as tha\xe2\x80\x99 stopped bein\xe2\x80\x99 afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nDickon. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99s stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you making Magic?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked sharply.\r\n\r\nDickon\xe2\x80\x99s curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s doin\xe2\x80\x99 Magic thysel\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s same Magic as made these\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ere work out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 earth,\xe2\x80\x9d and he touched with his thick boot a clump\r\nof crocuses in the grass.\r\n\r\nColin looked down at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere couldna\xe2\x80\x99 be bigger Magic than that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94there couldna\xe2\x80\x99 be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up straighter than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to walk to that tree,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to one a few feet\r\naway from him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.\r\nI can rest against the tree if I like. When I want to sit down I will\r\nsit down, but not before. Bring a rug from the chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully\r\nsteady. When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that\r\nhe supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straight\r\nthat he looked tall.\r\n\r\nWhen Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him\r\nstanding there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art sayin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked rather testily because he did not want his\r\nattention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBut she did not tell him. What she was saying was this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do it! You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! You\r\ncan do it! You _can!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep\r\nhim on his feet looking like that. She could not bear that he should\r\ngive in before Ben Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was uplifted\r\nby a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his\r\nthinness. He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me all over! Am I a hunchback?\r\nHave I got crooked legs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he had\r\nrecovered a little and answered almost in his usual way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot tha\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 sort. What\xe2\x80\x99s tha\xe2\x80\x99 been doin\xe2\x80\x99 with\r\nthysel\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94hidin\xe2\x80\x99 out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight an\xe2\x80\x99 lettin\xe2\x80\x99 folk think tha\xe2\x80\x99 was cripple an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhalf-witted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf-witted!\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWho thought that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots o\xe2\x80\x99 fools,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 world\xe2\x80\x99s full o\xe2\x80\x99 jackasses brayin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthey never bray nowt but lies. What did tha\xe2\x80\x99 shut thysel\xe2\x80\x99 up for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone thought I was going to die,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up\r\nand down, down and up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 die!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with dry exultation. \xe2\x80\x9cNowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 sort! Tha\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\ntoo much pluck in thee. When I seed thee put tha\xe2\x80\x99 legs on th\xe2\x80\x99 ground in\r\nsuch a hurry I knowed tha\xe2\x80\x99 was all right. Sit thee down on th\xe2\x80\x99 rug a\r\nbit young Mester an\xe2\x80\x99 give me thy orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd\r\nunderstanding in his manner. Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as\r\nshe could as they had come down the Long Walk. The chief thing to be\r\nremembered, she had told him, was that Colin was getting well\xe2\x80\x94getting\r\nwell. The garden was doing it. No one must let him remember about\r\nhaving humps and dying.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnythin\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m told to do,\xe2\x80\x9d answered old Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m kep\xe2\x80\x99 on by\r\nfavor\xe2\x80\x94because she liked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 mother,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ben Weatherstaff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, and he looked about him quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was her\r\ngarden, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, it was that!\xe2\x80\x9d and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwere main fond of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my garden now. I am fond of it. I shall come here every day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nannounced Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is to be a secret. My orders are that no one\r\nis to know that we come here. Dickon and my cousin have worked and made\r\nit come alive. I shall send for you sometimes to help\xe2\x80\x94but you must come\r\nwhen no one can see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s face twisted itself in a dry old smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come here before when no one saw me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 last time I was here,\xe2\x80\x9d rubbing his chin and looking round, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nabout two year\xe2\x80\x99 ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no one has been in it for ten years!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no one,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Ben dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come through th\xe2\x80\x99 door.\r\nI come over th\xe2\x80\x99 wall. Th\xe2\x80\x99 rheumatics held me back th\xe2\x80\x99 last two year\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 come an\xe2\x80\x99 did a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 prunin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nout how it had been done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was so fond of it\xe2\x80\x94she was!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nwas such a pretty young thing. She says to me once, \xe2\x80\x98Ben,\xe2\x80\x99 says she\r\nlaughin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98if ever I\xe2\x80\x99m ill or if I go away you must take care of my\r\nroses.\xe2\x80\x99 When she did go away th\xe2\x80\x99 orders was no one was ever to come\r\nnigh. But I come,\xe2\x80\x9d with grumpy obstinacy. \xe2\x80\x9cOver th\xe2\x80\x99 wall I come\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 rheumatics stopped me\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I did a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 work once a year. She\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngave her order first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been as wick as it is if tha\xe2\x80\x99 hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDickon. \xe2\x80\x9cI did wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you did it, Weatherstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll know how to\r\nkeep the secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, I\xe2\x80\x99ll know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99ll be easier for a man wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrheumatics to come in at th\xe2\x80\x99 door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel. Colin stretched\r\nout his hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his face and\r\nhe began to scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak enough but\r\npresently as they watched him\xe2\x80\x94Mary with quite breathless interest\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ndrove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do it! You can do it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, you\r\ncan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon\xe2\x80\x99s round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not a\r\nword. Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.\r\n\r\nColin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke\r\nexultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 said as tha\xe2\x80\x99d have me walkin\xe2\x80\x99 about here same as other folk\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntha\xe2\x80\x99 said tha\xe2\x80\x99d have me diggin\xe2\x80\x99. I thowt tha\xe2\x80\x99 was just leein\xe2\x80\x99 to please\r\nme. This is only th\xe2\x80\x99 first day an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 here I am diggin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he\r\nended by chuckling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat sounds as if tha\xe2\x80\x99d got wits enow. Tha\xe2\x80\x99rt a\r\nYorkshire lad for sure. An\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99rt diggin\xe2\x80\x99, too. How\xe2\x80\x99d tha\xe2\x80\x99 like to\r\nplant a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 somethin\xe2\x80\x99? I can get thee a rose in a pot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and get it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, digging excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick! Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his way\r\nforgetting rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper\r\nand wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it. Mary\r\nslipped out to run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon had\r\ndeepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over.\r\nHe looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new\r\nexercise, slight as it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to do it before the sun goes quite\xe2\x80\x94quite down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on\r\npurpose. Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the\r\ngreenhouse. He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could. He had begun\r\nto be excited, too. He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from\r\nthe mould.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing the plant to Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cSet it in the earth\r\nthysel\xe2\x80\x99 same as th\xe2\x80\x99 king does when he goes to a new place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thin white hands shook a little and Colin\xe2\x80\x99s flush grew deeper as he\r\nset the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the\r\nearth. It was filled in and pressed down and made steady. Mary was\r\nleaning forward on her hands and knees. Soot had flown down and marched\r\nforward to see what was being done. Nut and Shell chattered about it\r\nfrom a cherry-tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s planted!\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin at last. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the sun is only slipping over\r\nthe edge. Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when it goes.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s part of the Magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Dickon helped him, and the Magic\xe2\x80\x94or whatever it was\xe2\x80\x94so gave him\r\nstrength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange\r\nlovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his two\r\nfeet\xe2\x80\x94laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nMAGIC\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned\r\nto it. He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send\r\nsomeone out to explore the garden paths. When Colin was brought back to\r\nhis room the poor man looked him over seriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not have stayed so long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not overexert\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not tired at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has made me well. Tomorrow I\r\nam going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I can allow it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dr. Craven. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid\r\nit would not be wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be wise to try to stop me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin quite seriously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Mary had found out that one of Colin\xe2\x80\x99s chief peculiarities was\r\nthat he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with\r\nhis way of ordering people about. He had lived on a sort of desert\r\nisland all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his\r\nown manners and had had no one to compare himself with. Mary had indeed\r\nbeen rather like him herself and since she had been at Misselthwaite\r\nhad gradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind\r\nwhich is usual or popular. Having made this discovery she naturally\r\nthought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she sat and\r\nlooked at him curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone.\r\nShe wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at me for?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some\r\nsatisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t get Misselthwaite at all now I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for him because of that, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was\r\nthinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be\r\npolite for ten years to a boy who was always rude. I would never have\r\ndone it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I rude?\xe2\x80\x9d Colin inquired undisturbedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mary, \xe2\x80\x9che would have slapped you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he daren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he daren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite\r\nwithout prejudice. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody ever dared to do anything you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94because you were going to die and things like that. You were such\r\na poor thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Colin stubbornly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to be a poor thing.\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t let people think I\xe2\x80\x99m one. I stood on my feet this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is always having your own way that has made you so queer,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\r\nwent on, thinking aloud.\r\n\r\nColin turned his head, frowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I queer?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cvery. But you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be cross,\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nimpartially, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause so am I queer\xe2\x80\x94and so is Ben Weatherstaff. But I\r\nam not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I\r\nfound the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be queer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to be,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nfrowned again with determination.\r\n\r\nHe was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw\r\nhis beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall stop being queer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I go every day to the garden.\r\nThere is Magic in there\xe2\x80\x94good Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure there\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t real Magic,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can pretend it is.\r\n_Something_ is there\xe2\x80\x94_something!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Magic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not black. It\xe2\x80\x99s as white as snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months\r\nthat followed\xe2\x80\x94the wonderful months\xe2\x80\x94the radiant months\xe2\x80\x94the amazing ones.\r\nOh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have never had a\r\ngarden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will\r\nknow that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass\r\nthere. At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing\r\ntheir way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the\r\ncrevices of the walls. Then the green things began to show buds and the\r\nbuds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade\r\nof purple, every tint and hue of crimson. In its happy days flowers had\r\nbeen tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. Ben Weatherstaff\r\nhad seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the\r\nbricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things\r\nto grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and\r\nthe green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and\r\nwhite flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was main fond o\xe2\x80\x99 them\xe2\x80\x94she was,\xe2\x80\x9d Ben Weatherstaff said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe liked\r\nthem things as was allus pointin\xe2\x80\x99 up to th\xe2\x80\x99 blue sky, she used to tell.\r\nNot as she was one o\xe2\x80\x99 them as looked down on th\xe2\x80\x99 earth\xe2\x80\x94not her. She\r\njust loved it but she said as th\xe2\x80\x99 blue sky allus looked so joyful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended\r\nthem. Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score,\r\ngaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which\r\nit might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had\r\ngot there. And the roses\xe2\x80\x94the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangled\r\nround the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their\r\nbranches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long\r\ngarlands falling in cascades\xe2\x80\x94they came alive day by day, hour by hour.\r\nFair fresh leaves, and buds\xe2\x80\x94and buds\xe2\x80\x94tiny at first but swelling and\r\nworking Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent\r\ndelicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden\r\nair.\r\n\r\nColin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Every morning\r\nhe was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn\xe2\x80\x99t rain he\r\nspent in the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie on the\r\ngrass \xe2\x80\x9cwatching things growing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. If you watched long enough,\r\nhe declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. Also you could\r\nmake the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on\r\nvarious unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny\r\nscraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if\r\nthey were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the\r\ncountry. A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and\r\nmaking its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so\r\nlike elfish hands, had absorbed him one whole morning. Ants\xe2\x80\x99 ways,\r\nbeetles\xe2\x80\x99 ways, bees\xe2\x80\x99 ways, frogs\xe2\x80\x99 ways, birds\xe2\x80\x99 ways, plants\xe2\x80\x99 ways, gave\r\nhim a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added\r\nfoxes\xe2\x80\x99 ways, otters\xe2\x80\x99 ways, ferrets\xe2\x80\x99 ways, squirrels\xe2\x80\x99 ways, and trout\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand water-rats\xe2\x80\x99 and badgers\xe2\x80\x99 ways, there was no end to the things to\r\ntalk about and think over.\r\n\r\nAnd this was not the half of the Magic. The fact that he had really\r\nonce stood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when\r\nMary told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved\r\nof it greatly. He talked of it constantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there must be lots of Magic in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said wisely\r\none day, \xe2\x80\x9cbut people don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is like or how to make it.\r\nPerhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen\r\nuntil you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once\r\nfor Ben Weatherstaff. Ben came as quickly as he could and found the\r\nRajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also\r\nvery beautifully smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Ben Weatherstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you and Dickon and\r\nMiss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell\r\nyou something very important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead. (One\r\nof the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his\r\nboyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages. So he could\r\nreply like a sailor.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to try a scientific experiment,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the Rajah. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nI grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am\r\ngoing to begin now with this experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the\r\nfirst time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this\r\nstage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read\r\nabout a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing\r\nsort of boy. When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you\r\nit seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though he\r\nwas only ten years old\xe2\x80\x94going on eleven. At this moment he was\r\nespecially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of\r\nactually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great scientific discoveries I am going to make,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill be about Magic. Magic is a great thing and scarcely anyone knows\r\nanything about it except a few people in old books\xe2\x80\x94and Mary a little,\r\nbecause she was born in India where there are fakirs. I believe Dickon\r\nknows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know he knows it. He charms\r\nanimals and people. I would never have let him come to see me if he had\r\nnot been an animal charmer\xe2\x80\x94which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy\r\nis an animal. I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not\r\nsense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nelectricity and horses and steam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and\r\nreally could not keep still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and he began to stand up quite straight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,\xe2\x80\x9d the orator\r\nproceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cThen something began pushing things up out of the soil and\r\nmaking things out of nothing. One day things weren\xe2\x80\x99t there and another\r\nthey were. I had never watched things before and it made me feel very\r\ncurious. Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be\r\nscientific. I keep saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x98What is it? What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be nothing! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know its name so I call it\r\nMagic. I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from\r\nwhat they tell me I am sure that is Magic too. Something pushes it up\r\nand draws it. Sometimes since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the garden I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked up\r\nthrough the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being\r\nhappy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making\r\nme breathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things\r\nout of nothing. Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees,\r\nflowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it\r\nmust be all around us. In this garden\xe2\x80\x94in all the places. The Magic in\r\nthis garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a\r\nman. I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some\r\nand put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it\r\nand calling it perhaps it will come. Perhaps that is the first baby way\r\nto get it. When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept\r\nsaying to herself as fast as she could, \xe2\x80\x98You can do it! You can do it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand I did. I had to try myself at the same time, of course, but her\r\nMagic helped me\xe2\x80\x94and so did Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s. Every morning and evening and as\r\noften in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say, \xe2\x80\x98Magic is in\r\nme! Magic is making me well! I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as\r\nstrong as Dickon!\xe2\x80\x99 And you must all do it, too. That is my experiment\r\nWill you help, Ben Weatherstaff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through\r\ndrill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment\r\nsucceeds. You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking\r\nabout them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be\r\nthe same with Magic. If you keep calling it to come to you and help you\r\nit will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs\r\nwho said words over and over thousands of times,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Jem Fettleworth\xe2\x80\x99s wife say th\xe2\x80\x99 same thing over thousands o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94callin\xe2\x80\x99 Jem a drunken brute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff dryly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSummat allus come o\xe2\x80\x99 that, sure enough. He gave her a good hidin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwent to th\xe2\x80\x99 Blue Lion an\xe2\x80\x99 got as drunk as a lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes. Then he\r\ncheered up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see something did come of it. She used the wrong\r\nMagic until she made him beat her. If she\xe2\x80\x99d used the right Magic and\r\nhad said something nice perhaps he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got as drunk as a lord\r\nand perhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his little\r\nold eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cNext time I see Bess Fettleworth I\xe2\x80\x99ll give her a bit of a\r\nhint o\xe2\x80\x99 what Magic will do for her. She\xe2\x80\x99d be rare an\xe2\x80\x99 pleased if th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsinetifik \xe2\x80\x99speriment worked\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 so \xe2\x80\x99ud Jem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining with\r\ncurious delight. Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held a\r\nlong-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly\r\nwhile it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the experiment will work?\xe2\x80\x9d Colin asked him, wondering\r\nwhat he was thinking. He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking\r\nwhen he saw him looking at him or at one of his \xe2\x80\x9ccreatures\xe2\x80\x9d with his\r\nhappy wide smile.\r\n\r\nHe smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I do. It\xe2\x80\x99ll work same as th\xe2\x80\x99 seeds do when\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 sun shines on \xe2\x80\x99em. It\xe2\x80\x99ll work for sure. Shall us begin it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections of fakirs\r\nand devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit\r\ncross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be like sitting in a sort of temple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather\r\ntired and I want to sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon, \xe2\x80\x9ctha\xe2\x80\x99 mustn\xe2\x80\x99t begin by sayin\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99rt tired. Tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmight spoil th\xe2\x80\x99 Magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin turned and looked at him\xe2\x80\x94into his innocent round eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI must only think of the Magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their\r\ncircle. Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led into\r\nappearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in being\r\nwhat he called \xe2\x80\x9cagen\xe2\x80\x99 prayer-meetin\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d but this being the Rajah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffair he did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at\r\nbeing called upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured.\r\nDickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsignal no one heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest,\r\nthe crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made\r\npart of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their\r\nown desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98creatures\xe2\x80\x99 have come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to help\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought. He held his head\r\nhigh as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a\r\nwonderful look in them. The light shone on him through the tree canopy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we will begin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we sway backward and forward,\r\nMary, as if we were dervishes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna\xe2\x80\x99 do no swayin\xe2\x80\x99 back\xe2\x80\x99ard and for\xe2\x80\x99ard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got th\xe2\x80\x99 rheumatics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Magic will take them away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin in a High Priest tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwe won\xe2\x80\x99t sway until it has done it. We will only chant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI canna\xe2\x80\x99 do no chantin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nturned me out o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 church choir th\xe2\x80\x99 only time I ever tried it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one smiled. They were all too much in earnest. Colin\xe2\x80\x99s face was not\r\neven crossed by a shadow. He was thinking only of the Magic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will chant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And he began, looking like a strange boy\r\nspirit. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sun is shining\xe2\x80\x94the sun is shining. That is the Magic. The\r\nflowers are growing\xe2\x80\x94the roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Being\r\nalive is the Magic\xe2\x80\x94being strong is the Magic. The Magic is in me\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nMagic is in me. It is in me\xe2\x80\x94it is in me. It\xe2\x80\x99s in everyone of us. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it a great many times\xe2\x80\x94not a thousand times but quite a goodly\r\nnumber. Mary listened entranced. She felt as if it were at once queer\r\nand beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on. Ben Weatherstaff\r\nbegan to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable.\r\nThe humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice\r\nand drowsily melted into a doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his\r\nrabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb\xe2\x80\x99s back. Soot\r\nhad pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder,\r\nthe gray film dropped over his eyes. At last Colin stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am going to walk round the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced.\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with\r\na jerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowt o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 sort,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Ben. \xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 sermon was good enow\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbound to get out afore th\xe2\x80\x99 collection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not quite awake yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not in church,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, straightening himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said I were? I heard\r\nevery bit of it. You said th\xe2\x80\x99 Magic was in my back. Th\xe2\x80\x99 doctor calls it\r\nrheumatics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rajah waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the wrong Magic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will get better. You have my\r\npermission to go to your work. But come back tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see thee walk round the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Ben.\r\n\r\nIt was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt. In fact, being a\r\nstubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made up\r\nhis mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look\r\nover the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were\r\nany stumbling.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was\r\nformed. It really did look like a procession. Colin was at its head\r\nwith Dickon on one side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walked\r\nbehind, and the \xe2\x80\x9ccreatures\xe2\x80\x9d trailed after them, the lamb and the fox\r\ncub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping\r\nto nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt\r\nhimself in charge.\r\n\r\nIt was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. Every few\r\nyards it stopped to rest. Colin leaned on Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s arm and privately\r\nBen Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his\r\nhand from its support and walked a few steps alone. His head was held\r\nup all the time and he looked very grand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Magic is in me!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept saying. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Magic is making me strong! I\r\ncan feel it! I can feel it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him.\r\nHe sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on\r\nthe grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon,\r\nbut he would not give up until he had gone all round the garden. When\r\nhe returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it! The Magic worked!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is my first scientific\r\ndiscovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will Dr. Craven say?\xe2\x80\x9d broke out Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he will not be told.\r\nThis is to be the biggest secret of all. No one is to know anything\r\nabout it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any\r\nother boy. I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken\r\nback in it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have people whispering and asking questions and I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite\r\nsucceeded. Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall\r\njust walk into his study and say \xe2\x80\x98Here I am; I am like any other boy. I\r\nam quite well and I shall live to be a man. It has been done by a\r\nscientific experiment.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will think he is in a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t believe his\r\neyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he was\r\ngoing to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he\r\nhad been aware of it. And the thought which stimulated him more than\r\nany other was this imagining what his father would look like when he\r\nsaw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsons. One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had\r\nbeen his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was\r\nafraid to look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be obliged to believe them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I\r\nbegin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have thee takin\xe2\x80\x99 to boxin\xe2\x80\x99 in a week or so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99lt end wi\xe2\x80\x99 winnin\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 Belt an\xe2\x80\x99 bein\xe2\x80\x99 champion\r\nprize-fighter of all England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin fixed his eyes on him sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeatherstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is disrespectful. You must not take\r\nliberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works I\r\nshall not be a prize-fighter. I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAx pardon\xe2\x80\x94ax pardon, sir\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ben, touching his forehead in\r\nsalute. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have seed it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a jokin\xe2\x80\x99 matter,\xe2\x80\x9d but his eyes\r\ntwinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased. He really did not mind\r\nbeing snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining\r\nstrength and spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLET THEM LAUGH\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in. Round the\r\ncottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall\r\nof rough stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight\r\nand on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there\r\nplanting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and\r\nherbs for his mother. In the company of his \xe2\x80\x9ccreatures\xe2\x80\x9d he did wonders\r\nthere and was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While he dug or\r\nweeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to\r\nSoot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d never get on as comfortable as we do,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Sowerby said, \xe2\x80\x9cif it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s garden. Anything\xe2\x80\x99ll grow for him. His \xe2\x80\x99taters and\r\ncabbages is twice th\xe2\x80\x99 size of anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s an\xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a flavor\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em as nobody\xe2\x80\x99s has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him.\r\nAfter supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that\r\nwas her quiet time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on\r\nand hear stories of the day. She loved this time. There were not only\r\nvegetables in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flower\r\nseeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among\r\ngooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette\r\nand pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after\r\nyear or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into\r\nfine clumps. The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire\r\nbecause he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and\r\nhedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses\r\nof the stones were to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll a chap\xe2\x80\x99s got to do to make \xe2\x80\x99em thrive, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nto be friends with \xe2\x80\x99em for sure. They\xe2\x80\x99re just like th\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98creatures.\xe2\x80\x99 If\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re thirsty give \xe2\x80\x99em drink and if they\xe2\x80\x99re hungry give \xe2\x80\x99em a bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfood. They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that\r\nhappened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMester Colin\xe2\x80\x9d had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with\r\nMiss Mary and that it was doing him good. But it was not long before it\r\nwas agreed between the two children that Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s mother might \xe2\x80\x9ccome\r\ninto the secret.\xe2\x80\x9d Somehow it was not doubted that she was \xe2\x80\x9csafe for\r\nsure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all\r\nthe thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze\r\nwhich had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned\r\nnever to reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him,\r\nthe doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to\r\nthe hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nangry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin\xe2\x80\x99s sudden indignant\r\nstrength, made Mrs. Sowerby\xe2\x80\x99s nice-looking face quite change color\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a good thing that little lass came to th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nManor. It\xe2\x80\x99s been th\xe2\x80\x99 makin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 her an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 savin, o\xe2\x80\x99 him. Standin\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nhis feet! An\xe2\x80\x99 us all thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 he was a poor half-witted lad with not a\r\nstraight bone in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they make of it at th\xe2\x80\x99 Manor\xe2\x80\x94him being so well an\xe2\x80\x99 cheerful\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 never complainin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery day as\r\ncomes round his face looks different. It\xe2\x80\x99s fillin\xe2\x80\x99 out and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nso sharp an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 waxy color is goin\xe2\x80\x99. But he has to do his bit o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncomplainin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d with a highly entertained grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for, i\xe2\x80\x99 Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nDickon chuckled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does it to keep them from guessin\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s happened. If the doctor\r\nknew he\xe2\x80\x99d found out he could stand on his feet he\xe2\x80\x99d likely write and\r\ntell Mester Craven. Mester Colin\xe2\x80\x99s savin\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 secret to tell himself.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his father\r\ncomes back an\xe2\x80\x99 then he\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to march into his room an\xe2\x80\x99 show him he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas straight as other lads. But him an\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Mary thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s best plan\r\nto do a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 groanin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 frettin\xe2\x80\x99 now an\xe2\x80\x99 then to throw folk off th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nscent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had\r\nfinished his last sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat pair\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyin\xe2\x80\x99 theirselves I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget a good bit o\xe2\x80\x99 actin\xe2\x80\x99 out of it an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 children likes\r\nas much as play actin\xe2\x80\x99. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear what they do, Dickon lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her. His eyes\r\nwere twinkling with fun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he flies out at John, th\xe2\x80\x99 footman, for not carryin\xe2\x80\x99 him\r\ncareful enough. He makes himself as helpless lookin\xe2\x80\x99 as he can an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnever lifts his head until we\xe2\x80\x99re out o\xe2\x80\x99 sight o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 house. An\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ngrunts an\xe2\x80\x99 frets a good bit when he\xe2\x80\x99s bein\xe2\x80\x99 settled into his chair. Him\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Mary\xe2\x80\x99s both got to enjoyin\xe2\x80\x99 it an\xe2\x80\x99 when he groans an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncomplains she\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x98Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so\r\nweak as that, poor Colin?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but th\xe2\x80\x99 trouble is that sometimes they can\r\nscarce keep from burstin\xe2\x80\x99 out laughin\xe2\x80\x99. When we get safe into the\r\ngarden they laugh till they\xe2\x80\x99ve no breath left to laugh with. An\xe2\x80\x99 they\r\nhave to stuff their faces into Mester Colin\xe2\x80\x99s cushions to keep the\r\ngardeners from hearin\xe2\x80\x99, if any of, \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99s about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 more they laugh th\xe2\x80\x99 better for \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerby, still\r\nlaughing herself. \xe2\x80\x9cGood healthy child laughin\xe2\x80\x99s better than pills any\r\nday o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 year. That pair\xe2\x80\x99ll plump up for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are plumpin\xe2\x80\x99 up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re that hungry they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to get enough to eat without makin\xe2\x80\x99 talk. Mester Colin says if\r\nhe keeps sendin\xe2\x80\x99 for more food they won\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99s an invalid at\r\nall. Miss Mary says she\xe2\x80\x99ll let him eat her share, but he says that if\r\nshe goes hungry she\xe2\x80\x99ll get thin an\xe2\x80\x99 they mun both get fat at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty\r\nthat she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and\r\nDickon laughed with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee what, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of a way to help \xe2\x80\x99em. When tha\xe2\x80\x99 goes to \xe2\x80\x99em in th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmornin\xe2\x80\x99s tha\xe2\x80\x99 shall take a pail o\xe2\x80\x99 good new milk an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll bake \xe2\x80\x99em a\r\ncrusty cottage loaf or some buns wi\xe2\x80\x99 currants in \xe2\x80\x99em, same as you\r\nchildren like. Nothin\xe2\x80\x99s so good as fresh milk an\xe2\x80\x99 bread. Then they\r\ncould take off th\xe2\x80\x99 edge o\xe2\x80\x99 their hunger while they were in their garden\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 th, fine food they get indoors \xe2\x80\x99ud polish off th\xe2\x80\x99 corners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon admiringly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a wonder tha\xe2\x80\x99 art! Tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nalways sees a way out o\xe2\x80\x99 things. They was quite in a pother yesterday.\r\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t see how they was to manage without orderin\xe2\x80\x99 up more\r\nfood\xe2\x80\x94they felt that empty inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re two young \xe2\x80\x99uns growin\xe2\x80\x99 fast, an\xe2\x80\x99 health\xe2\x80\x99s comin\xe2\x80\x99 back to both\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em. Children like that feels like young wolves an\xe2\x80\x99 food\xe2\x80\x99s flesh an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nblood to \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Sowerby. Then she smiled Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s own curving\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! but they\xe2\x80\x99re enjoyin\xe2\x80\x99 theirselves for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nhad never been more so than when she said their \xe2\x80\x9cplay actin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d would be\r\ntheir joy. Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources\r\nof entertainment. The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had\r\nbeen unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and\r\nthen by Dr. Craven himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour appetite. Is improving very much, Master Colin,\xe2\x80\x9d the nurse had\r\nsaid one day. \xe2\x80\x9cYou used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing disagrees with me now\xe2\x80\x9d replied Colin, and then seeing the\r\nnurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he\r\nought not to appear too well just yet. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least things don\xe2\x80\x99t so often\r\ndisagree with me. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystified\r\nexpression. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow she stared at you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary when she went away. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if she\r\nthought there must be something to find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have her finding out things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one must begin\r\nto find out yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled, also. He asked a\r\nnumber of questions, to Colin\xe2\x80\x99s great annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stay out in the garden a great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not let anyone know where I go,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI go to a place\r\nI like. Everyone has orders to keep out of the way. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be watched\r\nand stared at. You know that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndo not think so. The nurse says that you eat much more than you have\r\never done before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps it is\r\nan unnatural appetite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr.\r\nCraven. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I am bloated and feverish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, assuming a\r\ndiscouraging air of gloom. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who are not going to live are\r\noften\xe2\x80\x94different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin\xe2\x80\x99s wrist and he pushed\r\nup his sleeve and felt his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not feverish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand such flesh as you\r\nhave gained is healthy. If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not\r\ntalk of dying. Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable\r\nimprovement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have him told!\xe2\x80\x9d Colin broke forth fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will only\r\ndisappoint him if I get worse again\xe2\x80\x94and I may get worse this very\r\nnight. I might have a raging fever. I feel as if I might be beginning\r\nto have one now. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have letters written to my father\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. I feel\r\nhot already. I hate being written about and being talked over as much\r\nas I hate being stared at!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush-h! my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Craven soothed him. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing shall be written\r\nwithout your permission. You are too sensitive about things. You must\r\nnot undo the good which has been done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse\r\nhe privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned\r\nto the patient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy is extraordinarily better,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHis advance seems almost\r\nabnormal. But of course he is doing now of his own free will what we\r\ncould not make him do before. Still, he excites himself very easily and\r\nnothing must be said to irritate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. From\r\nthis time dated their plan of \xe2\x80\x9cplay actin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be obliged to have a tantrum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to have one and I\xe2\x80\x99m not miserable enough now to work myself into a\r\nbig one. Perhaps I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have one at all. That lump doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come in\r\nmy throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible\r\nones. But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible\r\nto carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an\r\namazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast\r\nof home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and\r\nclotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found\r\nthemselves at the table\xe2\x80\x94particularly if there were delicate slices of\r\nsizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver\r\ncover\xe2\x80\x94they would look into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes in desperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin always\r\nended by saying. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can send away some of the lunch and a great deal\r\nof the dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they never found they could send away anything and the highly\r\npolished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened\r\nmuch comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin would say also, \xe2\x80\x9cI do wish the slices of ham were\r\nthicker, and one muffin each is not enough for anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s enough for a person who is going to die,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary when\r\nfirst she heard this, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for a person who is going to\r\nlive. I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh\r\nheather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe morning that Dickon\xe2\x80\x94after they had been enjoying themselves in the\r\ngarden for about two hours\xe2\x80\x94went behind a big rosebush and brought forth\r\ntwo tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with\r\ncream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant\r\nbuns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked\r\nin that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness.\r\nWhat a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind,\r\nclever woman she must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious\r\nfresh milk!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagic is in her just as it is in Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes her\r\nthink of ways to do things\xe2\x80\x94nice things. She is a Magic person. Tell her\r\nwe are grateful, Dickon\xe2\x80\x94extremely grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times. He enjoyed\r\nthem. He liked this so much that he improved upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with\r\nbuns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner\r\nof any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and\r\nbreathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.\r\nThey actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen\r\npeople to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two\r\nextra appetites every day. So they asked her to let them send some of\r\ntheir shillings to buy things.\r\n\r\nDickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park\r\noutside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild\r\ncreatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort\r\nof tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted\r\neggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt\r\nand fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king\xe2\x80\x94besides being\r\ndeliciously satisfying. You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as\r\nmany as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the\r\nmouths of fourteen people.\r\n\r\nEvery beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under\r\nthe plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after\r\nits brief blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always took\r\nhis walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly\r\nfound power at intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk more\r\nsteadily and cover more ground. And each day his belief in the Magic\r\ngrew stronger\xe2\x80\x94as well it might. He tried one experiment after another\r\nas he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him\r\nthe best things of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said one morning after an absence, \xe2\x80\x9cI went to Thwaite\r\nfor mother an\xe2\x80\x99 near th\xe2\x80\x99 Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth. He\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nstrongest chap on th\xe2\x80\x99 moor. He\xe2\x80\x99s the champion wrestler an\xe2\x80\x99 he can jump\r\nhigher than any other chap an\xe2\x80\x99 throw th\xe2\x80\x99 hammer farther. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone all\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 way to Scotland for th\xe2\x80\x99 sports some years. He\xe2\x80\x99s knowed me ever\r\nsince I was a little \xe2\x80\x99un an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s a friendly sort an\xe2\x80\x99 I axed him some\r\nquestions. Th\xe2\x80\x99 gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o\xe2\x80\x99 thee, Mester\r\nColin, and I says, \xe2\x80\x98How did tha\xe2\x80\x99 make tha\xe2\x80\x99 muscles stick out that way,\r\nBob? Did tha\xe2\x80\x99 do anythin\xe2\x80\x99 extra to make thysel\xe2\x80\x99 so strong?\xe2\x80\x99 An\xe2\x80\x99 he says\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite\r\nonce showed me how to exercise my arms an\xe2\x80\x99 legs an\xe2\x80\x99 every muscle in my\r\nbody. An\xe2\x80\x99 I says, \xe2\x80\x98Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, Bob?\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 he laughed an\xe2\x80\x99 says, \xe2\x80\x98Art tha\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 delicate chap?\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98No, but I knows a young gentleman that\xe2\x80\x99s gettin\xe2\x80\x99 well of a long\r\nillness an\xe2\x80\x99 I wish I knowed some o\xe2\x80\x99 them tricks to tell him about.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say no names an\xe2\x80\x99 he didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask none. He\xe2\x80\x99s friendly same as I\r\nsaid an\xe2\x80\x99 he stood up an\xe2\x80\x99 showed me good-natured like, an\xe2\x80\x99 I imitated\r\nwhat he did till I knowed it by heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin had been listening excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you show me?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickon answered, getting up. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he says tha\xe2\x80\x99 mun\r\ndo \xe2\x80\x99em gentle at first an\xe2\x80\x99 be careful not to tire thysel\xe2\x80\x99. Rest in\r\nbetween times an\xe2\x80\x99 take deep breaths an\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t overdo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me! Show me! Dickon, you are the\r\nmost Magic boy in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully\r\npractical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them\r\nwith widening eyes. He could do a few while he was sitting down.\r\nPresently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied\r\nfeet. Mary began to do them also. Soot, who was watching the\r\nperformance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about\r\nrestlessly because he could not do them too.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the exercises were part of the day\xe2\x80\x99s duties as much as\r\nthe Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of\r\nthem each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but\r\nfor the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he\r\narrived they would have been lost. But the little oven in the hollow\r\nand Mrs. Sowerby\xe2\x80\x99s bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and\r\nthe nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle with\r\nyour breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the\r\nbrim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and\r\noatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are eating next to nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll die of\r\nstarvation if they can\xe2\x80\x99t be persuaded to take some nourishment. And yet\r\nsee how they look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! I\xe2\x80\x99m moithered to death\r\nwith them. They\xe2\x80\x99re a pair of young Satans. Bursting their jackets one\r\nday and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can\r\ntempt them with. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread\r\nsauce did they set a fork into yesterday\xe2\x80\x94and the poor woman fair\r\n_invented_ a pudding for them\xe2\x80\x94and back it\xe2\x80\x99s sent. She almost cried.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s afraid she\xe2\x80\x99ll be blamed if they starve themselves into their\r\ngraves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an\r\nextremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed\r\nhim the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to\r\nlook at\xe2\x80\x94but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin\xe2\x80\x99s sofa\r\nand examined him. He had been called to London on business and had not\r\nseen the boy for nearly two weeks. When young things begin to gain\r\nhealth they gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and\r\na warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the\r\nhollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out. His\r\nonce dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily\r\nfrom his forehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were\r\nfuller and of a normal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was\r\na confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his\r\nchin in his hand and thought him over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will\r\nnot do. You will lose all you have gained\xe2\x80\x94and you have gained\r\namazingly. You ate so well a short time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you it was an unnatural appetite,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Colin.\r\n\r\nMary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer\r\nsound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost\r\nchoking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her.\r\n\r\nMary became quite severe in her manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was something between a sneeze and a cough,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with\r\nreproachful dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cand it got into my throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d she said afterward to Colin, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop myself. It just\r\nburst out because all at once I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help remembering that last big\r\npotato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through\r\nthat thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any way in which those children can get food secretly?\xe2\x80\x9d Dr.\r\nCraven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the\r\ntrees,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Medlock answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey stay out in the grounds all day\r\nand see no one but each other. And if they want anything different to\r\neat from what\xe2\x80\x99s sent up to them they need only ask for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Craven, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as going without food agrees with\r\nthem we need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo is the girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s begun to be downright\r\npretty since she\xe2\x80\x99s filled out and lost her ugly little sour look. Her\r\nhair\xe2\x80\x99s grown thick and healthy looking and she\xe2\x80\x99s got a bright color.\r\nThe glummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and\r\nMaster Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones. Perhaps\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re growing fat on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Craven. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nTHE CURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed\r\nnew miracles. In the robin\xe2\x80\x99s nest there were Eggs and the robin\xe2\x80\x99s mate\r\nsat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and\r\ncareful wings. At first she was very nervous and the robin himself was\r\nindignantly watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown\r\ncorner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some\r\nmysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little\r\npair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what\r\nwas happening to them\xe2\x80\x94the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking\r\nbeauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in that\r\ngarden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if\r\nan Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and\r\ncrash through space and come to an end\xe2\x80\x94if there had been even one who\r\ndid not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness\r\neven in that golden springtime air. But they all knew it and felt it\r\nand the robin and his mate knew they knew it.\r\n\r\nAt first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety. For some\r\nmysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon. The first moment he\r\nset his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger\r\nbut a sort of robin without beak or feathers. He could speak robin\r\n(which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other).\r\nTo speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman.\r\nDickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he\r\nused when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least. The robin\r\nthought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not\r\nintelligent enough to understand feathered speech. His movements also\r\nwere robin. They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem\r\ndangerous or threatening. Any robin could understand Dickon, so his\r\npresence was not even disturbing.\r\n\r\nBut at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other\r\ntwo. In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden\r\non his legs. He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of\r\nwild animals were thrown over him. That in itself was doubtful. Then\r\nwhen he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer\r\nunaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him. The robin\r\nused to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head\r\ntilted first on one side and then on the other. He thought that the\r\nslow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do.\r\nWhen cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very\r\nslowly. The robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few\r\ndays but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because her\r\nterror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the\r\nEggs.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it\r\nwas an immense relief. But for a long time\xe2\x80\x94or it seemed a long time to\r\nthe robin\xe2\x80\x94he was a source of some anxiety. He did not act as the other\r\nhumans did. He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sitting\r\nor lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner\r\nto begin again.\r\n\r\nOne day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to\r\nlearn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. He\r\nhad taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to\r\nrest. So it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly\xe2\x80\x94or rather\r\nto walk. He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the\r\nEggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were\r\nfledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and\r\nderived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her\r\nnest\xe2\x80\x94though she always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and\r\nlearn more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans were\r\nalways more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed\r\nreally to learn to fly at all. You never met them in the air or on\r\ntree-tops.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all\r\nthree of the children at times did unusual things. They would stand\r\nunder the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way\r\nwhich was neither walking nor running nor sitting down. They went\r\nthrough these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never\r\nable to explain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do. He\r\ncould only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in\r\nsuch a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was\r\ndoing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions\r\nwere not of a dangerous nature. Of course neither the robin nor his\r\nmate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his\r\nexercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps. Robins are not\r\nlike human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first\r\nand so they develop themselves in a natural manner. If you have to fly\r\nabout to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied\r\n(atrophied means wasted away through want of use).\r\n\r\nWhen the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like\r\nthe others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace\r\nand content. Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that\r\nyour Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the\r\nfact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting\r\na most entertaining occupation. On wet days the Eggs\xe2\x80\x99 mother sometimes\r\nfelt even a little dull because the children did not come into the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nBut even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were\r\ndull. One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was\r\nbeginning to feel a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on his\r\nsofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that I am a real boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin had said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy legs and arms and all\r\nmy body are so full of Magic that I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep them still. They want to\r\nbe doing things all the time. Do you know that when I waken in the\r\nmorning, Mary, when it\xe2\x80\x99s quite early and the birds are just shouting\r\noutside and everything seems just shouting for joy\xe2\x80\x94even the trees and\r\nthings we can\xe2\x80\x99t really hear\xe2\x80\x94I feel as if I must jump out of bed and\r\nshout myself. If I did it, just think what would happen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary giggled inordinately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and\r\nthey would be sure you had gone crazy and they\xe2\x80\x99d send for the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nColin giggled himself. He could see how they would all look\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nhorrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish my father would come home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell him\r\nmyself. I\xe2\x80\x99m always thinking about it\xe2\x80\x94but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this\r\nmuch longer. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand lying still and pretending, and besides I\r\nlook too different. I wish it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raining today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColin,\xe2\x80\x9d she began mysteriously, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know how many rooms there are\r\nin this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a thousand, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s about a hundred no one ever goes into,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd one\r\nrainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them. No one ever\r\nknew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way when I was\r\ncoming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor. That was the\r\nsecond time I heard you crying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin started up on his sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred rooms no one goes into,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds almost like a\r\nsecret garden. Suppose we go and look at them. Wheel me in my chair and\r\nnobody would know we went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one would dare to follow\r\nus. There are galleries where you could run. We could do our exercises.\r\nThere is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory\r\nelephants. There are all sorts of rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRing the bell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin.\r\n\r\nWhen the nurse came in he gave his orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want my chair,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Mary and I are going to look at the\r\npart of the house which is not used. John can push me as far as the\r\npicture-gallery because there are some stairs. Then he must go away and\r\nleave us alone until I send for him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRainy days lost their terrors that morning. When the footman had\r\nwheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in\r\nobedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted. As\r\nsoon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to his\r\nown quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexercises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they did all these things and many others. They looked at the\r\nportraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and\r\nholding the parrot on her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be my relations. They lived a long time\r\nago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great,\r\ngreat aunts. She looks rather like you, Mary\xe2\x80\x94not as you look now but as\r\nyou looked when you came here. Now you are a great deal fatter and\r\nbetter looking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo are you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, and they both laughed.\r\n\r\nThey went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory\r\nelephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in\r\nthe cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away\r\nand the hole was empty. They saw more rooms and made more discoveries\r\nthan Mary had made on her first pilgrimage. They found new corridors\r\nand corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and\r\nweird old things they did not know the use of. It was a curiously\r\nentertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same\r\nhouse with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were\r\nmiles away from them was a fascinating thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad we came,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew I lived in such a big\r\nqueer old place. I like it. We will ramble about every rainy day. We\r\nshall always be finding new queer corners and things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat morning they had found among other things such good appetites that\r\nwhen they returned to Colin\xe2\x80\x99s room it was not possible to send the\r\nluncheon away untouched.\r\n\r\nWhen the nurse carried the tray downstairs she slapped it down on the\r\nkitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly\r\npolished dishes and plates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a house of mystery, and those two\r\nchildren are the greatest mysteries in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they keep that up every day,\xe2\x80\x9d said the strong young footman John,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99d be small wonder that he weighs twice as much today as he did a\r\nmonth ago. I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doing\r\nmy muscles an injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom. She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because\r\nshe thought the change might have been made by chance. She said nothing\r\ntoday but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.\r\nShe could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside. That was\r\nthe change she noticed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you want me to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, after she had stared\r\na few minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cI always know when you want me to tell you something.\r\nYou are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. I am going to keep it\r\nlike that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me angry any more to see her laughing. I\r\nwakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the\r\nMagic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie still. I got up and looked out of the window. The room was\r\nquite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and\r\nsomehow that made me go and pull the cord. She looked right down at me\r\nas if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there. It\r\nmade me like to look at her. I want to see her laughing like that all\r\nthe time. I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so like her now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cthat sometimes I think perhaps\r\nyou are her ghost made into a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over and then answered\r\nher slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were her ghost\xe2\x80\x94my father would be fond of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want him to be fond of you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to hate it because he was not fond of me. If he grew fond of me\r\nI think I should tell him about the Magic. It might make him more\r\ncheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIT\xe2\x80\x99S MOTHER!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir belief in the Magic was an abiding thing. After the morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nincantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause when I grow up and make great\r\nscientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so\r\nthis is practise. I can only give short lectures now because I am very\r\nyoung, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church\r\nand he would go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 best thing about lecturin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, \xe2\x80\x9cis that a chap can get up\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 say aught he pleases an\xe2\x80\x99 no other chap can answer him back. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be agen\xe2\x80\x99 lecturin\xe2\x80\x99 a bit mysel\xe2\x80\x99 sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes\r\non him and kept them there. He looked him over with critical affection.\r\nIt was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which\r\nlooked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held\r\nitself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had\r\nfilled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light\r\nhe remembered in another pair. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben\xe2\x80\x99s earnest\r\ngaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was\r\nreflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinkin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ben, \xe2\x80\x9cas I\xe2\x80\x99d warrant tha\xe2\x80\x99s gone up three or\r\nfour pound this week. I was lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at tha\xe2\x80\x99 calves an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 shoulders.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to get thee on a pair o\xe2\x80\x99 scales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Magic and\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Sowerby\xe2\x80\x99s buns and milk and things,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nColin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see the scientific experiment has succeeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he came he\r\nwas ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than\r\nusual. As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they\r\nfell to work. They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking\r\nrain. The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the\r\nweeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which\r\nmust be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold. Colin was as\r\ngood at weeding as anyone in these days and he could lecture while he\r\nwas doing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Magic works best when you work, yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said this morning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can feel it in your bones and muscles. I am going to read books\r\nabout bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. I\r\nam making it up now. I keep finding out things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his\r\ntrowel and stood up on his feet. He had been silent for several minutes\r\nand they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did.\r\nWhen he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and\r\nDickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it. He stretched\r\nhimself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly.\r\nColor glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness.\r\nAll at once he had realized something to the full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary! Dickon!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cJust look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stopped their weeding and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that first morning you brought me in here?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nDickon was looking at him very hard. Being an animal charmer he could\r\nsee more things than most people could and many of them were things he\r\nnever talked about. He saw some of them now in this boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that we do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nMary looked hard too, but she said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust this minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, \xe2\x80\x9call at once I remembered it\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel\xe2\x80\x94and I had to\r\nstand up on my feet to see if it was real. And it is real! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n_well_\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m _well!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that th\xe2\x80\x99 art!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dickon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m well! I\xe2\x80\x99m well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin again, and his face went quite red all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nHe had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and\r\nthought about it, but just at that minute something had rushed all\r\nthrough him\xe2\x80\x94a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been\r\nso strong that he could not help calling out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall live forever and ever and ever!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried grandly. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nfind out thousands and thousands of things. I shall find out about\r\npeople and creatures and everything that grows\xe2\x80\x94like Dickon\xe2\x80\x94and I shall\r\nnever stop making Magic. I\xe2\x80\x99m well! I\xe2\x80\x99m well! I feel\xe2\x80\x94I feel as if I want\r\nto shout out something\xe2\x80\x94something thankful, joyful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 might sing th\xe2\x80\x99 Doxology,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested in his dryest grunt. He\r\nhad no opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the suggestion with\r\nany particular reverence.\r\n\r\nBut Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the\r\nDoxology.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDickon can sing it for thee, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ben Weatherstaff.\r\n\r\nDickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer\xe2\x80\x99s smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey sing it i\xe2\x80\x99 church,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMother says she believes th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nskylarks sings it when they gets up i\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 mornin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she says that, it must be a nice song,\xe2\x80\x9d Colin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nbeen in a church myself. I was always too ill. Sing it, Dickon. I want\r\nto hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He understood what\r\nColin felt better than Colin did himself. He understood by a sort of\r\ninstinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding. He\r\npulled off his cap and looked round still smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99 must take off tha\xe2\x80\x99 cap,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Colin, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 so mun tha\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nBen\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 tha\xe2\x80\x99 mun stand up, tha\xe2\x80\x99 knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair\r\nas he watched Dickon intently. Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his\r\nknees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look\r\non his old face as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly why he was doing this\r\nremarkable thing.\r\n\r\nDickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in\r\nquite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPraise God from whom all blessings flow,\r\nPraise Him all creatures here below,\r\nPraise Him above ye Heavenly Host,\r\nPraise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\r\n            Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with\r\nhis jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed on\r\nColin. Colin\xe2\x80\x99s face was thoughtful and appreciative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very nice song,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI like it. Perhaps it means just\r\nwhat I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe stopped and thought in a puzzled way. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they are both the\r\nsame thing. How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it\r\nagain, Dickon. Let us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s my song.\r\nHow does it begin? \xe2\x80\x98Praise God from whom all blessings flow\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as\r\nmusically as they could and Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s swelled quite loud and\r\nbeautiful\xe2\x80\x94and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared his\r\nthroat and at the third line he joined in with such vigor that it\r\nseemed almost savage and when the \xe2\x80\x9cAmen\xe2\x80\x9d came to an end Mary observed\r\nthat the very same thing had happened to him which had happened when he\r\nfound out that Colin was not a cripple\xe2\x80\x94his chin was twitching and he\r\nwas staring and winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never seed no sense in th\xe2\x80\x99 Doxology afore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hoarsely, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nmay change my mind i\xe2\x80\x99 time. I should say tha\xe2\x80\x99d gone up five pound this\r\nweek Mester Colin\xe2\x80\x94five on \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin was looking across the garden at something attracting his\r\nattention and his expression had become a startled one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is coming in here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had\r\nentered. She had come in with the last line of their song and she had\r\nstood still listening and looking at them. With the ivy behind her, the\r\nsunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak,\r\nand her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like\r\na softly colored illustration in one of Colin\xe2\x80\x99s books. She had\r\nwonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in\xe2\x80\x94all of\r\nthem, even Ben Weatherstaff and the \xe2\x80\x9ccreatures\xe2\x80\x9d and every flower that\r\nwas in bloom. Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them felt\r\nthat she was an intruder at all. Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes lighted like lamps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s who it is!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried and went across the grass at a\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nColin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him. They both\r\nfelt their pulses beat faster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s mother!\xe2\x80\x9d Dickon said again when they met halfway. \xe2\x80\x9cI knowed tha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwanted to see her an\xe2\x80\x99 I told her where th\xe2\x80\x99 door was hid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his\r\neyes quite devoured her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven when I was ill I wanted to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and Dickon and\r\nthe secret garden. I\xe2\x80\x99d never wanted to see anyone or anything before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her\r\nown. She flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed\r\nto sweep over her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! dear lad!\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out tremulously. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! dear lad!\xe2\x80\x9d as if she\r\nhad not known she were going to say it. She did not say, \xe2\x80\x9cMester\r\nColin,\xe2\x80\x9d but just \xe2\x80\x9cdear lad\xe2\x80\x9d quite suddenly. She might have said it to\r\nDickon in the same way if she had seen something in his face which\r\ntouched her. Colin liked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you surprised because I am so well?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tha\xe2\x80\x99rt so like thy mother tha\xe2\x80\x99 made my\r\nheart jump.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin a little awkwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will make my\r\nfather like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, for sure, dear lad,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered and she gave his shoulder a\r\nsoft quick pat. \xe2\x80\x9cHe mun come home\xe2\x80\x94he mun come home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSusan Sowerby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 lad\xe2\x80\x99s legs, wilt tha\xe2\x80\x99? They was like drumsticks i\xe2\x80\x99 stockin\xe2\x80\x99 two\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x99 ago\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I heard folk tell as they was bandy an\xe2\x80\x99 knock-kneed both\r\nat th\xe2\x80\x99 same time. Look at \xe2\x80\x99em now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be fine strong lad\xe2\x80\x99s legs in a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nhim go on playin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 workin\xe2\x80\x99 in the garden an\xe2\x80\x99 eatin\xe2\x80\x99 hearty an\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndrinkin\xe2\x80\x99 plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 good sweet milk an\xe2\x80\x99 there\xe2\x80\x99ll not be a finer pair i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYorkshire, thank God for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put both hands on Mistress Mary\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and looked her little\r\nface over in a motherly fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 thee, too!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99rt grown near as hearty as our\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Lisabeth Ellen. I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant tha\xe2\x80\x99rt like thy mother too. Our Martha\r\ntold me as Mrs. Medlock heard she was a pretty woman. Tha\xe2\x80\x99lt be like a\r\nblush rose when tha\xe2\x80\x99 grows up, my little lass, bless thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not mention that when Martha came home on her \xe2\x80\x9cday out\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ndescribed the plain sallow child she had said that she had no\r\nconfidence whatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nto reason that a pretty woman could be th\xe2\x80\x99 mother o\xe2\x80\x99 such a fou\xe2\x80\x99 little\r\nlass,\xe2\x80\x9d she had added obstinately.\r\n\r\nMary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face. She\r\nhad only known that she looked \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\xe2\x80\x9d and seemed to have a great\r\ndeal more hair and that it was growing very fast. But remembering her\r\npleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she was glad to hear\r\nthat she might some day look like her.\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole\r\nstory of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive. Colin\r\nwalked on one side of her and Mary on the other. Each of them kept\r\nlooking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the\r\ndelightful feeling she gave them\xe2\x80\x94a sort of warm, supported feeling. It\r\nseemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his \xe2\x80\x9ccreatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were\r\nchildren. Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew\r\nupon her shoulder as if it were Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s. When they told her about the\r\nrobin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly\r\nlittle mellow laugh in her throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose learnin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em to fly is like learnin\xe2\x80\x99 children to walk, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlegs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nIt was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorland\r\ncottage way that at last she was told about the Magic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in Magic?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Colin after he had explained about\r\nIndian fakirs. \xe2\x80\x9cI do hope you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I do, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knowed it by that name but\r\nwhat does th\xe2\x80\x99 name matter? I warrant they call it a different name i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nFrance an\xe2\x80\x99 a different one i\xe2\x80\x99 Germany. Th\xe2\x80\x99 same thing as set th\xe2\x80\x99 seeds\r\nswellin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 sun shinin\xe2\x80\x99 made thee a well lad an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s th\xe2\x80\x99 Good\r\nThing. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called\r\nout of our names. Th\xe2\x80\x99 Big Good Thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop to worrit, bless\r\nthee. It goes on makin\xe2\x80\x99 worlds by th\xe2\x80\x99 million\xe2\x80\x94worlds like us. Never\r\nthee stop believin\xe2\x80\x99 in th\xe2\x80\x99 Big Good Thing an\xe2\x80\x99 knowin\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 world\xe2\x80\x99s full\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 call it what tha\xe2\x80\x99 likes. Tha\xe2\x80\x99 wert singin\xe2\x80\x99 to it when I come\r\ninto th\xe2\x80\x99 garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt so joyful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin, opening his beautiful strange eyes at\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly I felt how different I was\xe2\x80\x94how strong my arms and legs\r\nwere, you know\xe2\x80\x94and how I could dig and stand\xe2\x80\x94and I jumped up and wanted\r\nto shout out something to anything that would listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTh\xe2\x80\x99 Magic listened when tha\xe2\x80\x99 sung th\xe2\x80\x99 Doxology. It would ha\xe2\x80\x99 listened\r\nto anything tha\xe2\x80\x99d sung. It was th\xe2\x80\x99 joy that mattered. Eh! lad,\r\nlad\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s names to th\xe2\x80\x99 Joy Maker,\xe2\x80\x9d and she gave his shoulders a quick\r\nsoft pat again.\r\n\r\nShe had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and\r\nwhen the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding\r\nplace, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour\r\ntheir food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites. She was\r\nfull of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things. She told\r\nthem stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words. She laughed\r\nas if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing\r\ndifficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful\r\ninvalid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see we can\xe2\x80\x99t help laughing nearly all the time when we are\r\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound ill at all. We try to\r\nchoke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that comes into my mind so often,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\ncan scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly. I keep thinking\r\nsuppose Colin\xe2\x80\x99s face should get to look like a full moon. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\none yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day\xe2\x80\x94and suppose some\r\nmorning it should look like one\xe2\x80\x94what should we do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless us all, I can see tha\xe2\x80\x99 has a good bit o\xe2\x80\x99 play actin\xe2\x80\x99 to do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Susan Sowerby. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tha\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t have to keep it up much longer.\r\nMester Craven\xe2\x80\x99ll come home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he will?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby chuckled softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it \xe2\x80\x99ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha\xe2\x80\x99 told\r\nhim in tha\xe2\x80\x99 own way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s laid awake nights plannin\xe2\x80\x99 it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear anyone else to tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cI think about\r\ndifferent ways every day, I think now I just want to run into his\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99d be a fine start for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Sowerby. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see\r\nhis face, lad. I would that! He mun come back\xe2\x80\x94that he mun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to her\r\ncottage. They planned it all. They were to drive over the moor and\r\nlunch out of doors among the heather. They would see all the twelve\r\nchildren and Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s garden and would not come back until they were\r\ntired.\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock.\r\nIt was time for Colin to be wheeled back also. But before he got into\r\nhis chair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with\r\na kind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold\r\nof her blue cloak and held it fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are just what I\xe2\x80\x94what I wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94as well as Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm arms\r\nclose against the bosom under the blue cloak\xe2\x80\x94as if he had been Dickon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother. The quick mist swept over her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! dear lad!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThy own mother\xe2\x80\x99s in this \xe2\x80\x99ere very garden, I\r\ndo believe. She couldna\xe2\x80\x99 keep out of it. Thy father mun come back to\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94he mun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nIN THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have\r\nbeen discovered. In the last century more amazing things were found out\r\nthan in any century before. In this new century hundreds of things\r\nstill more astounding will be brought to light. At first people refuse\r\nto believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to\r\nhope it can be done, then they see it can be done\xe2\x80\x94then it is done and\r\nall the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago. One of the new\r\nthings people began to find out in the last century was that\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94just mere thoughts\xe2\x80\x94are as powerful as electric batteries\xe2\x80\x94as\r\ngood for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison. To let a sad\r\nthought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a\r\nscarlet fever germ get into your body. If you let it stay there after\r\nit has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.\r\n\r\nSo long as Mistress Mary\xe2\x80\x99s mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about\r\nher dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to\r\nbe pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced,\r\nsickly, bored and wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very\r\nkind to her, though she was not at all aware of it. They began to push\r\nher about for her own good. When her mind gradually filled itself with\r\nrobins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed\r\nold gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime\r\nand with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor\r\nboy and his \xe2\x80\x9ccreatures,\xe2\x80\x9d there was no room left for the disagreeable\r\nthoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow\r\nand tired.\r\n\r\nSo long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his\r\nfears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and\r\nreflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical\r\nhalf-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and\r\nthe spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand\r\nupon his feet if he tried to do it. When new beautiful thoughts began\r\nto push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his\r\nblood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like\r\na flood. His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and\r\nthere was nothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things\r\ncan happen to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought\r\ncomes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it\r\nout by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things\r\ncannot be in one place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you tend a rose, my lad,\r\nA thistle cannot grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming\r\nalive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away\r\nbeautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains\r\nof Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind\r\nfilled with dark and heart-broken thinking. He had not been courageous;\r\nhe had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark\r\nones. He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain on\r\nmountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him\r\nand flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them. A\r\nterrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had\r\nlet his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to\r\nallow any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten and\r\ndeserted his home and his duties. When he traveled about, darkness so\r\nbrooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people\r\nbecause it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom. Most\r\nstrangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden\r\ncrime on his soul. He, was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked\r\nshoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArchibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his\r\nstudy and told her she might have her \xe2\x80\x9cbit of earth.\xe2\x80\x9d He had been in\r\nthe most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere\r\nmore than a few days. He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He\r\nhad been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and\r\nhad looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them\r\nwith such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.\r\n\r\nBut the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he\r\nrealized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had\r\nhappened. He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had\r\nbeen walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoul out of shadow. He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his.\r\nBut at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a\r\ncarpet of moss by a stream. It was a clear little stream which ran\r\nquite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp\r\ngreenness. Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as\r\nit bubbled over and round stones. He saw birds come and dip their heads\r\nto drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like\r\na thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper.\r\nThe valley was very, very still.\r\n\r\nAs he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven\r\ngradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the\r\nvalley itself. He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.\r\nHe sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things\r\ngrowing at its edge. There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots\r\ngrowing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he\r\nfound himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things\r\nyears ago. He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what\r\nwonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were. He did not know\r\nthat just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind\xe2\x80\x94filling and\r\nfilling it until other things were softly pushed aside. It was as if a\r\nsweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen\r\nand risen until at last it swept the dark water away. But of course he\r\ndid not think of this himself. He only knew that the valley seemed to\r\ngrow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate\r\nblueness. He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening\r\nto him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up\r\nslowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath\r\nand wondering at himself. Something seemed to have been unbound and\r\nreleased in him, very quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand over\r\nhis forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost feel as if\xe2\x80\x94I were alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to\r\nbe able to explain how this had happened to him. Neither does anyone\r\nelse yet. He did not understand at all himself\xe2\x80\x94but he remembered this\r\nstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he\r\nfound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out\r\nas he went into the secret garden:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to live forever and ever and ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he\r\nslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long. He did\r\nnot know that it could be kept. By the next night he had opened the\r\ndoors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing\r\nback. He left the valley and went on his wandering way again. But,\r\nstrange as it seemed to him, there were minutes\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\r\nhalf-hours\xe2\x80\x94when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to\r\nlift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.\r\nSlowly\xe2\x80\x94slowly\xe2\x80\x94for no reason that he knew of\xe2\x80\x94he was \xe2\x80\x9ccoming alive\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nAs the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the\r\nLake of Como. There he found the loveliness of a dream. He spent his\r\ndays upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the\r\nsoft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that\r\nhe might sleep. But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he knew,\r\nand his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cmy body is growing stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was growing stronger but\xe2\x80\x94because of the rare peaceful hours when his\r\nthoughts were changed\xe2\x80\x94his soul was slowly growing stronger, too. He\r\nbegan to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.\r\nNow and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what\r\nhe should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed\r\nagain and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it\r\nslept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.\r\nHe shrank from it.\r\n\r\nOne marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon\r\nwas high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver. The\r\nstillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not\r\ngo into the villa he lived in. He walked down to a little bowered\r\nterrace at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the\r\nheavenly scents of the night. He felt the strange calmness stealing\r\nover him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his\r\ndream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming. He\r\nremembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought\r\nhe was. He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the late\r\nroses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard a\r\nvoice calling. It was sweet and clear and happy and far away. It seemed\r\nvery far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArchie! Archie! Archie!\xe2\x80\x9d it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer\r\nthan before, \xe2\x80\x9cArchie! Archie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought he sprang to his feet not even startled. It was such a real\r\nvoice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLilias! Lilias!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLilias! where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d it came back like a sound from a golden flute. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\ngarden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the dream ended. But he did not awaken. He slept soundly and\r\nsweetly all through the lovely night. When he did awake at last it was\r\nbrilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him. He was an\r\nItalian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa\r\nwere, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign\r\nmaster might do. No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or\r\nwhere he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or\r\nlie in the boat on the lake all night. The man held a salver with some\r\nletters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them. When he\r\nhad gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and\r\nlooking at the lake. His strange calm was still upon him and something\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not\r\nhappened as he thought\xe2\x80\x94as if something had changed. He was remembering\r\nthe dream\xe2\x80\x94the real\xe2\x80\x94real dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, wondering at himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden! But the\r\ndoor is locked and the key is buried deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one\r\nlying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from\r\nYorkshire. It was directed in a plain woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand but it was not a\r\nhand he knew. He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the\r\nfirst words attracted his attention at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\nI am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor. It\r\nwas about Miss Mary I spoke. I will make bold to speak again. Please,\r\nsir, I would come home if I was you. I think you would be glad to come\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94if you will excuse me, sir\xe2\x80\x94I think your lady would ask you to come\r\nif she was here.\r\n\r\n    Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                Susan Sowerby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.\r\nHe kept thinking about the dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go back to Misselthwaite,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to\r\nprepare for his return to England.\r\n\r\nIn a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad\r\njourney he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in\r\nall the ten years past. During those years he had only wished to forget\r\nhim. Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories of him\r\nconstantly drifted into his mind. He remembered the black days when he\r\nhad raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was\r\ndead. He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it at\r\nlast it had been, such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been\r\nsure it would die in a few days. But to the surprise of those who took\r\ncare of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it\r\nwould be a deformed and crippled creature.\r\n\r\nHe had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father\r\nat all. He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had\r\nshrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his\r\nown misery. The first time after a year\xe2\x80\x99s absence he returned to\r\nMisselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and\r\nindifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes\r\nround them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had\r\nadored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as\r\ndeath. After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,\r\nand all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a\r\nvicious, hysterical, half-insane temper. He could only be kept from\r\nfuries dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.\r\n\r\nAll this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled\r\nhim through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was \xe2\x80\x9ccoming\r\nalive\xe2\x80\x9d began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cTen\r\nyears is a long time. It may be too late to do anything\xe2\x80\x94quite too late.\r\nWhat have I been thinking of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course this was the wrong Magic\xe2\x80\x94to begin by saying \xe2\x80\x9ctoo late.\xe2\x80\x9d Even\r\nColin could have told him that. But he knew nothing of Magic\xe2\x80\x94either\r\nblack or white. This he had yet to learn. He wondered if Susan Sowerby\r\nhad taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creature\r\nhad realized that the boy was much worse\xe2\x80\x94was fatally ill. If he had not\r\nbeen under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession\r\nof him he would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm had\r\nbrought a sort of courage and hope with it. Instead of giving way to\r\nthoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in\r\nbetter things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him good\r\nand control him?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and see her on my way to\r\nMisselthwaite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the\r\ncottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a\r\ngroup and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him\r\nthat their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the\r\nmorning to help a woman who had a new baby. \xe2\x80\x9cOur Dickon,\xe2\x80\x9d they\r\nvolunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where\r\nhe went several days each week.\r\n\r\nMr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round\r\nred-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he\r\nawoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot. He smiled at\r\ntheir friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and\r\ngave it to \xe2\x80\x9cour \xe2\x80\x99Lizabeth Ellen\xe2\x80\x9d who was the oldest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for\r\neach of, you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThen amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away,\r\nleaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.\r\n\r\nThe drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.\r\nWhy did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been\r\nsure he could never feel again\xe2\x80\x94that sense of the beauty of land and sky\r\nand purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing,\r\nnearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six\r\nhundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering\r\nto think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed\r\nwith the brocaded hangings. Was it possible that perhaps he might find\r\nhim changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his\r\nshrinking from him? How real that dream had been\xe2\x80\x94how wonderful and\r\nclear the voice which called back to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden\xe2\x80\x94In the\r\ngarden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to find the key,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will try to open the door. I\r\nmust\xe2\x80\x94though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the\r\nusual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to\r\nthe remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher. He went\r\ninto the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock. She came to him somewhat\r\nexcited and curious and flustered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Master Colin, Medlock?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Medlock answered, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s different, in a manner\r\nof speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock really was flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she tried to explain, \xe2\x80\x9cneither Dr. Craven, nor\r\nthe nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might be\r\nchanging for the worse. His appetite, sir, is past understanding\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhis ways\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he become more\xe2\x80\x94more peculiar?\xe2\x80\x9d her master, asked, knitting his\r\nbrows anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99s growing very peculiar\xe2\x80\x94when you compare him with\r\nwhat he used to be. He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began\r\nto eat something enormous\xe2\x80\x94and then he stopped again all at once and the\r\nmeals were sent back just as they used to be. You never knew, sir,\r\nperhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken. The\r\nthings we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave\r\na body trembling like a leaf. He\xe2\x80\x99d throw himself into such a state that\r\nDr. Craven said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be responsible for forcing him. Well, sir,\r\njust without warning\xe2\x80\x94not long after one of his worst tantrums he\r\nsuddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan\r\nSowerby\xe2\x80\x99s boy Dickon that could push his chair. He took a fancy to both\r\nMiss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he look?\xe2\x80\x9d was the next question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he took his food natural, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99d think he was putting on\r\nflesh\xe2\x80\x94but we\xe2\x80\x99re afraid it may be a sort of bloat. He laughs sometimes\r\nin a queer way when he\xe2\x80\x99s alone with Miss Mary. He never used to laugh\r\nat all. Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow him.\r\nHe never was as puzzled in his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Master Colin now?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Craven asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99s always in the garden\xe2\x80\x94though not a human\r\ncreature is allowed to go near for fear they\xe2\x80\x99ll look at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he\r\nstood and repeated it again and again. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was\r\nstanding in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went\r\nout of the room. He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in\r\nthe shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds. The fountain\r\nwas playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.\r\nHe crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls.\r\nHe did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path. He\r\nfelt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long\r\nforsaken, and he did not know why. As he drew near to it his step\r\nbecame still more slow. He knew where the door was even though the ivy\r\nhung thick over it\xe2\x80\x94but he did not know exactly where it lay\xe2\x80\x94that buried\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nSo he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment\r\nafter he had paused he started and listened\xe2\x80\x94asking himself if he were\r\nwalking in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs,\r\nno human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\ninside the garden there were sounds. They were the sounds of running\r\nscuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they\r\nwere strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices\xe2\x80\x94exclamations and\r\nsmothered joyous cries. It seemed actually like the laughter of young\r\nthings, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to\r\nbe heard but who in a moment or so\xe2\x80\x94as their excitement mounted\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nburst forth. What in heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name was he dreaming of\xe2\x80\x94what in heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things\r\nwhich were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice had\r\nmeant?\r\n\r\nAnd then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds\r\nforgot to hush themselves. The feet ran faster and faster\xe2\x80\x94they were\r\nnearing the garden door\xe2\x80\x94there was quick strong young breathing and a\r\nwild outbreak of laughing shouts which could not be contained\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\ndoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back,\r\nand a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the\r\noutsider, dashed almost into his arms.\r\n\r\nMr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a\r\nresult of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to\r\nlook at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall boy and a handsome one. He was glowing with life and his\r\nrunning had sent splendid color leaping to his face. He threw the thick\r\nhair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes\xe2\x80\x94eyes\r\nfull of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe. It\r\nwas the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94What? Who!\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\nThis was not what Colin had expected\xe2\x80\x94this was not what he had planned.\r\nHe had never thought of such a meeting. And yet to come dashing\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94winning a race\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it was even better. He drew himself up to\r\nhis very tallest. Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed\r\nthrough the door too, believed that he managed to make himself look\r\ntaller than he had ever looked before\xe2\x80\x94inches taller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Colin. You can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. I scarcely can\r\nmyself. I\xe2\x80\x99m Colin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he\r\nsaid hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden! In the garden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d hurried on Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the garden that did it\xe2\x80\x94and Mary and\r\nDickon and the creatures\xe2\x80\x94and the Magic. No one knows. We kept it to\r\ntell you when you came. I\xe2\x80\x99m well, I can beat Mary in a race. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto be an athlete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said it all so like a healthy boy\xe2\x80\x94his face flushed, his words\r\ntumbling over each other in his eagerness\xe2\x80\x94that Mr. Craven\xe2\x80\x99s soul shook\r\nwith unbelieving joy.\r\n\r\nColin put out his hand and laid it on his father\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad, Father?\xe2\x80\x9d he ended. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nlive forever and ever and ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Craven put his hands on both the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and held him\r\nstill. He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me into the garden, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell me all\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so they led him in.\r\n\r\nThe place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue\r\nand flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies\r\nstanding together\xe2\x80\x94lilies which were white or white and ruby. He\r\nremembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at\r\nthis season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.\r\nLate roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening\r\nthe hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an\r\nembowered temple of gold. The newcomer stood silent just as the\r\nchildren had done when they came into its grayness. He looked round and\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would be dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary thought so at first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Colin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it came alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they sat down under their tree\xe2\x80\x94all but Colin, who wanted to stand\r\nwhile he told the story.\r\n\r\nIt was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought,\r\nas it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion. Mystery and Magic and\r\nwild creatures, the weird midnight meeting\xe2\x80\x94the coming of the spring\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npassion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah to his feet\r\nto defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face. The odd companionship, the\r\nplay acting, the great secret so carefully kept. The listener laughed\r\nuntil tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears came into his eyes\r\nwhen he was not laughing. The Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific\r\nDiscoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the end of the story, \xe2\x80\x9cit need not be a secret any\r\nmore. I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94but I am never going to get into the chair again. I shall walk back\r\nwith you, Father\xe2\x80\x94to the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff\xe2\x80\x99s duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on\r\nthis occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen\r\nand being invited into the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a\r\nglass of beer he was on the spot\xe2\x80\x94as he had hoped to be\xe2\x80\x94when the most\r\ndramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present\r\ngeneration actually took place.\r\n\r\nOne of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of\r\nthe lawn. Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped\r\nthat he might have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his\r\nmeeting with Master Colin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see either of them, Weatherstaff?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nBen took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back\r\nof his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with a shrewdly significant air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth of them?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Ben Weatherstaff. \xe2\x80\x9cThank ye kindly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\r\ncould sup up another mug of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTogether?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTogether, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to each\r\nother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didna\xe2\x80\x99 hear that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben, \xe2\x80\x9calong o\xe2\x80\x99 only bein\xe2\x80\x99 on th\xe2\x80\x99 stepladder\r\nlookin over th\xe2\x80\x99 wall. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee this. There\xe2\x80\x99s been things\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 on outside as you house people knows nowt about. An\xe2\x80\x99 what tha\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind out tha\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and\r\nwaved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the\r\nshrubbery a piece of the lawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif tha\xe2\x80\x99s curious. Look what\xe2\x80\x99s comin\xe2\x80\x99 across th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little\r\nshriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes\r\nalmost starting out of their heads.\r\n\r\nAcross the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many\r\nof them had never seen him. And by his side with his head up in the air\r\nand his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any\r\nboy in Yorkshire\xe2\x80\x94Master Colin!\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SECRET GARDEN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 113-0.txt or 113-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/113/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
