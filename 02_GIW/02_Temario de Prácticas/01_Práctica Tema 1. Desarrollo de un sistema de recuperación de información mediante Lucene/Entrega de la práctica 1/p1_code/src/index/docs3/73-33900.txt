This plaintext version of the e-book\r\ncontains only Volume I and the front matter of Volume II. To see and\r\nhear the musical examples in Volume II, see the HTML version.\r\n\r\nThe original uses boxed numbers to refer to sections of musical\r\nscores. They are represented here in double square brackets, e.g.,\r\n[[27]], [[B]]. See the footnote at the beginning of Chapter II for the\r\neditor\'s explanation of the musical examples and the boxed rehearsal\r\nnumbers. The use of asterisks is explained in the Editor\'s Preface.\r\n\r\nObvious printer errors have been corrected without note. Other\r\napparent errors are noted with a [Transcriber\'s Note].\r\n\r\nThe original contains a number of tables of instrument distribution.\r\nThose occurring in the middle of a line are rendered in a single line,\r\nusing forward slashes to indicate line breaks. For example, where the\r\nfollowing occurs in the middle of a line, in the original,\r\n\r\nVns I  ]\r\nVns II ]\r\nVns III] 8\r\n\r\nit is rendered in this e-book as\r\n\r\nVns I/Vns II/Vns III] 8.\r\n\r\nThis e-book uses the octave numbering system to describe the\r\nsingle-note music examples. Under this system, for example, middle C\r\nis C4, and the scale following would be D4, E4, etc.; the C below\r\nmiddle C is rendered as C3, and the scale following would be D3, E3,\r\netc.; the C above middle C is rendered as C5, and the scale following\r\nwould be D5, E5, etc.\r\n\r\nSharp, flat, and natural symbols are rendered as [sharp], [flat], and\r\n[natural], respectively. Other musical symbols are rendered as\r\n[symbol: name].\r\n\r\nItalics are surrounded by _underscores_.

We have in our possession a thick note book of some 200\r\npages in fine hand writing, dating from the years 1873-1874,\r\ncontaining a monograph on the question of acoustics, a classification\r\nof wind instruments and a detailed description of the construction and\r\nfingering of the different kinds of flute, the oboe, clarinet and\r\nhorn.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This manuscript was given to me by Alexander Glazounov;\r\nif a Rimsky-Korsakov museum is ever founded it will be placed there.]\r\n\r\nIn his "Memoirs of my musical life" (1st edition, p. 120) the\r\nfollowing passage occurs: "I had planned to devote all my energies to\r\nthe compilation of a full treatise on orchestration. To this end I\r\nmade several rough copies, jotting down explanatory notes detailing\r\nthe technique of different instruments. What I intended to present to\r\nthe world on this subject, was to include _everything_. The writing of\r\nthis treatise, or, to be more exact, the sketch for it took up most of\r\nmy time in the years 1873 and 1874. After reading the works of Tyndall\r\nand Helmholtz, I framed an introduction to my work, in which I\r\nendeavoured to expound the laws of acoustics as applied to the\r\nprinciples governing the construction of musical instruments. My\r\nmanual was to begin with a detailed list of instruments, classified in\r\ngroups and tabulated, including a description of the various systems\r\nin use at the present day. I had not yet thought of the second part of\r\nthe book which was to be devoted to instruments in combination. But I\r\nsoon realised that I had gone too far. With wind instruments in\r\nparticular, the different systems were innumerable, and each\r\nmanufacturer favoured his own pet theory. By the addition of a certain\r\nkey the maker endowed his instrument with the possibility of a new\r\ntrill, and made some difficult passages more playable than on an\r\ninstrument of another kind.\r\n\r\n"There was no end to such complications. In the brass, I found\r\ninstruments with three, four, and five valves, the mechanism varying\r\naccording to the make. Obviously, I could not hope to cover so large a\r\nfield; besides, of what value would such a treatise be to the student?\r\nSuch a mass of detailed description of the various systems, their\r\nadvantages and drawbacks, could not but fail to confuse the reader\r\nonly too eager to learn. Naturally he would wish to know what\r\ninstrument to employ, the extent of its capabilities etc., and getting\r\nno satisfactory information he would throw my massive work aside. For\r\nthese reasons my interest in the book gradually waned, and finally I\r\ngave up the task."\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Rimsky-Korsakov, now an artist of standing, the composer of\r\n_Snegourotchka_, _Mlada_, and _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, a master of the\r\norchestral technique he had been teaching for twenty years, returned\r\nto his handbook on instrumentation. He would seem to have made notes\r\nat different times from 1891 to 1893, during which period, after the\r\nfirst performance of _Mlada_, he gave up composition for a while.\r\nThese notes, occasionally referred to in his _Memoirs_, are in three\r\nvolumes of manuscript-paper. They contain the unfinished preface of\r\n1891, a paragraph full of clear, thoughtful writing, and reprinted in\r\nthis book.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This preface had already been published in his _Notes and\r\nArticles on Music_ (St. Petersburgh, 1911).]\r\n\r\nAs the author tells us in his _Memoirs_ (p. 297), the progress of his\r\nwork was hampered by certain troublesome events which were happening\r\nat the time. Dissatisfied with his rough draft, he destroyed the\r\ngreater part of it, and once more abandoned his task.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 he composed _The Christmas Night_; this was the beginning of\r\nhis most fertile period. He became entirely engrossed in composition,\r\nmaking plans for a fresh opera as soon as the one in hand was\r\ncompleted. It was not until 1905 that his thoughts returned to the\r\ntreatise on orchestration, his musical output remaining in abeyance\r\nthrough no fault of his own. Since 1891 the plan of the work had been\r\nentirely remodelled, as proved by the rough drafts still extant. The\r\nauthor had given up the idea of describing different instruments from\r\ntheir technical standpoint, and was more anxious to dwell upon the\r\nvalue of tone qualities and their various combinations.\r\n\r\nAmong the author\'s papers several forms of the book have been found,\r\neach widely differing in detail from the other. At last, in the summer\r\nof 1905 Rimsky-Korsakov brought his plans to a head, and outlined the\r\nsix chapters which form the foundation of the present volume. But the\r\nwork suffered a further interruption, and the sketches were once more\r\nlaid aside. In his _Memoirs_, Rimsky-Korsakov explains the fact by\r\nlack of interest in the work and a general feeling of weariness: "The\r\ntreatise remained in abeyance. To start with, the form of the book was\r\nnot a success, and I awaited the production of _Kitesh_, in order to\r\ngive some examples from that work" (p. 360).\r\n\r\nThen came the autumn of 1906. The composer experienced another rush of\r\ncreative energy; his opera, _The Golden Cockerel_ made rapid strides,\r\nand kept him busy all that winter and the following summer. When it\r\nwas finished, in the autumn of 1907, his thoughts reverted to the\r\ntreatise on orchestration. But the work made little progress. The\r\nauthor had his doubts as to the adequacy of the plan he had adopted,\r\nand, in spite of the entreaties of his pupils and friends, he could\r\nnot bring himself to broach the latter part of the book. Towards the\r\nend of 1907 Rimsky-Korsakov was constantly ailing in health, and this\r\nmaterially affected his energy. He spent the greater part of his time\r\nreading old notes and classifying examples. About the 20th of May\r\nhe set out for his summer residence in Lioubensk, and having just\r\nrecovered from a third severe attack of inflammation of the lungs,\r\nbegan to work on the first chapter of the treatise in its present,\r\nfinal form. This chapter was finished on June 7/20, about 4 o\'clock in\r\nthe afternoon; the same night, the composer was seized with a fourth\r\nattack which proved fatal.\r\n\r\nThe honour fell on me to prepare this last work of Rimsky-Korsakov for\r\npublication. Now that _Principles of Orchestration_ has appeared in\r\nprint I think it necessary to devote a few words to the essential\r\nfeatures of the book, and to the labour imposed upon me in my capacity\r\nas editor.\r\n\r\nOn the first point I will say but little. The reader will observe from\r\nthe Contents that the work differs from others, not merely by reason\r\nof its musical examples, but more especially in the systematic\r\narrangement of material, not according to orchestral division in\r\ngroups (the method adopted by Gevaert for instance), but according to\r\n_each constituent of the musical whole, considered separately_. The\r\norchestration of melodic and harmonic elements (Chapters II and III)\r\nreceives special attention, as does the question of orchestration in\r\ngeneral (Chapter IV). The last two chapters are devoted to operatic\r\nmusic, and the sixth takes a supplementary form, having no direct\r\nbearing on the previous matter.\r\n\r\nRimsky-Korsakov altered the title of his book several times, and his\r\nfinal choice was never made. The title I have selected seems to me to\r\nbe the one most suitable to the contents of the work, "principles" in\r\nthe truest sense of the word. Some may expect to find the "secrets" of\r\nthe great orchestrator disclosed; but, as he himself reminds us in his\r\npreface, "to orchestrate is to create, and this is something which\r\ncannot be taught."\r\n\r\nYet, as invention, in all art, is closely allied to technique, this\r\nbook may reveal much to the student of instrumentation.\r\nRimsky-Korsakov has often repeated the axiom that _good orchestration\r\nmeans proper handling of parts_. The simple use of tone-colours and\r\ntheir combinations may also be taught, but there the science of\r\ninstruction ends. From these standpoints the present book will furnish\r\nthe pupil with nearly everything he requires. The author\'s death\r\nprevented him from discussing a few questions, amongst which I would\r\ninclude full polyphonic orchestration and the scoring of melodic and\r\nharmonic designs. But these questions can be partly solved by the\r\nprinciples laid down in Chapters II and III, and I have no wish to\r\novercrowd the first edition of this book with extra matter which can\r\nbe added later, if it is found to be necessary. I had first of all to\r\nprepare and amplify the sketches made by Rimsky-Korsakov in 1905;\r\nthese form a connected summary throughout the whole six chapters.\r\nChapter I was completed by the author; it is published as it stands,\r\nsave for a few unimportant alterations in style. As regards the other\r\nfive chapters, I have tried to keep to the original drafts as far as\r\npossible, and have only made a few changes in the order, and one or\r\ntwo indispensable additions. The sketches made between 1891 and 1893\r\nwere too disconnected to be of much use, but, in point of fact, they\r\ncorresponded very closely to the final form of the work.\r\n\r\nThe musical examples are of greater importance. According to the\r\noriginal scheme, as noted on the 1891 MS., they were to be drawn from\r\nthe works of Glinka and Tschaikovsky; those of Borodin and Glazounov\r\nwere to be added later. The idea of choosing examples solely from his\r\nown works only came to Rimsky-Korsakov by degrees. The reasons for\r\nthis decision are partly explained in the unfinished preface of 1905,\r\nbut other motives may be mentioned. If Rimsky-Korsakov had chosen his\r\nexamples from the works of these four composers, he would have had to\r\ngive some account of their individual, and often strongly marked\r\npeculiarities of style. This would have been a difficult undertaking,\r\nand then, how to justify the exclusion of West-European composers,\r\nRichard Wagner, for example, whose orchestration Rimsky-Korsakov so\r\ngreatly admired? Besides, the latter could hardly fail to realise that\r\nhis own compositions afforded sufficient material to illustrate every\r\nconceivable manner of scoring, examples _emanating from one great\r\ngeneral principle_. This is not the place to criticise his method;\r\nRimsky-Korsakov\'s "school" is here displayed, each may examine it for\r\nhimself. The brilliant, highly-coloured orchestration of Russian\r\ncomposers, and the scoring of the younger French musicians are largely\r\ndevelopments of the methods of Rimsky-Korsakov, who, in turn, looked\r\nupon Glinka as his spiritual father.\r\n\r\nThe table of examples found among the author\'s papers was far from\r\ncomplete; some portions were badly explained, others, not at all. The\r\ncomposer had not mentioned which musical quotations were to be printed\r\nin the second volume, and which examples were to indicate the study of\r\nthe full score; further, no limit was fixed to the length of\r\nquotation. All this was therefore left to the editor\'s discretion. I\r\nselected the examples only after much doubt and hesitation, finding it\r\ndifficult to keep to those stipulated by the composer, as every page\r\nof the master\'s works abounds in appropriate instances of this or that\r\nmethod of scoring.\r\n\r\nI was guided by the following considerations which agreed with the\r\nopinions of the author himself: in the first place the examples should\r\nbe as simple as possible, so as not to distract the student\'s\r\nattention from the point under discussion; secondly, it was necessary\r\nthat one example should serve to illustrate several sections of the\r\nbook, and lastly, the majority of quotations should be those mentioned\r\nby the author. These amount to 214, in the second volume; the\r\nremaining 98 were added by me. They are drawn, as far as possible,\r\nfrom Rimsky-Korsakov\'s dramatic music, since operatic full-scores are\r\nless accessible than those of symphonic works.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Recently the firm of Belaieff has published\r\nRimsky-Korsakov\'s symphonic works in miniature score, pocket-size.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of Vol. II I have added three tables showing different ways\r\nof scoring full chords; all my additions to the text are marked with\r\nasterisks. I consider that the careful study of the examples contained\r\nin the second volume will be of the greatest use to the student\r\n_without replacing_ the need for the study of other composers\' scores.\r\nBroadly speaking, the present work should be studied together with the\r\nreading of full scores in general.\r\n\r\nA few words remain to be said regarding Rimsky-Korsakov\'s intention to\r\npoint out the faulty passages in his orchestral works, an intention\r\nexpressed in his preface to the last edition. The composer often\r\nreferred to the instructional value of such examinations. His purpose\r\nhowever was never achieved. It is not for me to select these examples,\r\nand I shall only mention two which were pointed out by the composer\r\nhimself: 1. _The Legend of Tsar Saltan_ [[220]], 7th bar--the theme\r\nin the brass is not sufficiently prominent the trombones being _tacet_\r\n(a mistake easily rectified); 2. _The Golden Cockerel_ [[233]], bars\r\n10-14, if the marks of expression are observed in the brass, the\r\ncounter-melody on the violas and violoncellos doubled by the wood-wind\r\nwill hardly be heard. Example 75 may also be mentioned, to which the\r\nnote on page 63, in the text, refers. I will confine myself to these\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I desire to express my deep gratitude to Madame\r\nRimsky-Korsakov for having entrusted me with the task of editing this\r\nwork, thereby providing me with the opportunity of performing a duty\r\nsacred to the memory of a master, held so deeply in reverence.\r\n\r\n_St. Petersburgh_, December 1912.\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN STEINBERG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from the Author\'s Preface (1891).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur epoch, the post-Wagnerian age, is the age of brilliance and\r\nimaginative quality in orchestral tone colouring. Berlioz, Glinka,\r\nLiszt, Wagner, modern French composers--Delibes, Bizet and others;\r\nthose of the new Russian school--Borodin, Balakirev, Glazounov and\r\nTschaikovsky--have brought this side of musical art to its zenith;\r\nthey have eclipsed, as colourists, their predecessors, Weber,\r\nMeyerbeer and Mendelssohn, to whose genius, nevertheless, they are\r\nindebted for their own progress. In writing this book my chief aim has\r\nbeen to provide the well-informed reader with the fundamental\r\nprinciples of modern orchestration from the standpoint of brilliance\r\nand imagination, and I have devoted considerable space to the study of\r\ntonal resonance and orchestral combination.\r\n\r\nI have tried to show the student how to obtain a certain quality of\r\ntone, how to acquire uniformity of structure and requisite power. I\r\nhave specified the character of certain melodic figures and designs\r\npeculiar to each instrument or orchestral group, and reduced these\r\nquestions briefly and clearly to general principles; in short I have\r\nendeavoured to furnish the pupil with matter and material as carefully\r\nand minutely studied as possible. Nevertheless I do not claim to\r\ninstruct him as to how such information should be put to artistic use,\r\nnor to establish my examples in their rightful place in the poetic\r\nlanguage of music. For, just as a handbook of harmony, counterpoint,\r\nor form presents the student with harmonic or polyphonic matter,\r\nprinciples of construction, formal arrangement, and sound technical\r\nmethods, but will never endow him with the talent for composition, so\r\na treatise on orchestration can demonstrate how to produce a\r\nwell-sounding chord of certain tone-quality, uniformly distributed,\r\nhow to detach a melody from its harmonic setting, correct progression\r\nof parts, and solve all such problems, but will never be able to teach\r\nthe art of poetic orchestration. To orchestrate is to create, and this\r\nis something which cannot be taught.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to say: this composer scores well, or, that\r\ncomposition is well orchestrated, for orchestration is _part of the\r\nvery soul of the work_. A work is thought out in terms of the\r\norchestra, certain tone-colours being inseparable from it in the mind\r\nof its creator and native to it from the hour of its birth. Could the\r\nessence of Wagner\'s music be divorced from its orchestration? One\r\nmight as well say that a picture is well _drawn_ in colours.\r\n\r\nMore than one classical and modern composer has lacked the capacity to\r\norchestrate with imagination and power; the secret of colour has\r\nremained outside the range of his creative faculty. Does it follow\r\nthat these composers do not _know how_ to orchestrate? Many among them\r\nhave had greater knowledge of the subject than the mere colourist. Was\r\nBrahms ignorant of orchestration? And yet, nowhere in his works do we\r\nfind evidence of brilliant tone or picturesque fancy. The truth is\r\nthat his thoughts did not turn towards colour; his mind did not exact\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe power of subtle orchestration is a secret impossible to transmit,\r\nand the composer who possesses this secret should value it highly, and\r\nnever debase it to the level of a mere collection of formul\xc3\xa6 learned\r\nby heart.\r\n\r\nHere I may mention the case of works scored by others from the\r\ncomposer\'s rough directions. He who undertakes such work should enter\r\nas deeply as he may into the spirit of the composer, try to realise\r\nhis intentions, and develop them in all their essential features.\r\n\r\nThough one\'s own personality be subordinate to that of another, such\r\norchestration is nevertheless creative work. But on the other hand, to\r\nscore a composition never intended for the orchestra, is an\r\nundesirable practice. Many musicians have made this mistake and\r\npersist in it.[4] In any case this is the lowest form of\r\ninstrumentation, akin to colour photography, though of course the\r\nprocess may be well or badly done.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In the margin of the MS. a question mark is added here.\r\n(Editor\'s note.)]\r\n\r\nAs regards orchestration it has been my good fortune to belong to a\r\nfirst-rate school, and I have acquired the most varied experience. In\r\nthe first place I have had the opportunity of hearing all my works\r\nperformed by the excellent orchestra of the St. Petersburgh Opera.\r\nSecondly, having experienced leanings towards different directions, I\r\nhave scored for orchestras of different sizes, beginning with simple\r\ncombinations (my opera _The May Night_ is written for natural horns\r\nand trumpets), and ending with the most advanced. In the third place,\r\nI conducted the choir of the Military Marine for several years and was\r\ntherefore able to study wind-instruments. Finally I formed an\r\norchestra of very young pupils, and succeeded in teaching them to\r\nplay, quite competently, the works of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Glinka,\r\netc. All this has enabled me to present this work to the public as the\r\nresult of long experience.\r\n\r\nAs a starting-point I lay down the following fundamental axioms:\r\n\r\nI. _In the orchestra there is no such thing as ugly quality of tone._\r\n\r\nII. _Orchestral writing should be easy to play_; a composer\'s work\r\nstands the best chance when the parts are well written.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A. Glazounov has well expressed the various degrees of\r\nexcellence in scoring, which he divides into three classes: 1. When\r\nthe orchestra sounds well, playing from sight; magnificent, after a\r\nfew rehearsals. 2. When effects cannot be brought off except with the\r\ngreatest care and attention on the part of conductor and players. 3.\r\nWhen the orchestra never sounds well. Evidently the chief aim in\r\norchestration is to obtain the first of these results. (Author\'s\r\nnote.)]\r\n\r\nIII. _A work should be written for the size of orchestra that is to\r\nperform it_, not for some imaginary body, as many composers persist in\r\ndoing, introducing brass instruments in unusual keys upon which the\r\nmusic is impracticable because it is not played in the key the\r\ncomposer intends.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to devise any method of learning orchestration without\r\na master. As a general rule it is best to advance by degrees from the\r\nsimplest scoring to the most complicated.\r\n\r\nThe student will probably pass through the following phases: 1. the\r\nphase during which he puts his entire faith in percussion\r\ninstruments, believing that beauty of sound emanates entirely from\r\nthis branch of the orchestra--this is the earliest stage; 2. the\r\nperiod when he acquires a passion for the harp, using it in every\r\npossible chord; 3. the stage during which he adores the wood-wind and\r\nhorns, using stopped notes in conjunction with strings, muted or\r\n_pizzicato_; 4. the more advanced period, when he has come to\r\nrecognise that the string group is the richest and most expressive of\r\nall. When the student works alone he must try to avoid the pitfalls of\r\nthe first three phases. The best plan is to study full-scores, and\r\nlisten to an orchestra, score in hand. But it is difficult to decide\r\nwhat music should be studied and heard. Music of all ages, certainly,\r\nbut, principally, that which is fairly modern. Fairly modern music\r\nwill teach the student how to score--classical music will prove of\r\nnegative value to him. Weber, Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer (_The Prophet_),\r\nBerlioz, Glinka, Wagner, Liszt, and modern French and Russian\r\ncomposers--these will prove his best guides. It is useless for a\r\nBerlioz or a Gevaert to quote examples from the works of Gluck. The\r\nmusical idiom is too old-fashioned and strange to modern ears; such\r\nexamples are of no further use today. The same may be said of Mozart\r\nand of Haydn (the father of modern orchestration).\r\n\r\nThe gigantic figure of Beethoven stands apart. His music abounds in\r\ncountless leonine leaps of orchestral imagination, but his technique,\r\nviewed in detail, remains much inferior to his titanic conception. His\r\nuse of the trumpets, standing out above the rest of the orchestra, the\r\ndifficult and unhappy intervals he gives to the horns, the distinctive\r\nfeatures of the string parts and his often highly-coloured employment\r\nof the wood-wind,--these features will combine causing the student of\r\nBeethoven to stumble upon a thousand and one points in contradiction.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to think that the beginner will light upon no simple\r\nand instructive examples in modern music, in that of Wagner and\r\nothers. On the contrary, clearer, and better examples are to be found\r\namongst modern composers than in what is called the range of classical\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from the Preface to the last edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy aim in undertaking this work is to reveal the principles of modern\r\norchestration in a somewhat different light than that usually brought\r\nto bear upon the subject. I have followed these principles in\r\norchestrating my own works, and, wishing to impart some of my ideas to\r\nyoung composers, I have quoted examples from my own compositions, or\r\ngiven references to them, endeavouring to show, in all sincerity, what\r\nis successful and what is not. No one can know except the author\r\nhimself the purpose and motives which governed him during the\r\ncomposition of a certain work, and the practice of explaining the\r\nintentions of a composer, so prevalent amongst annotators, however\r\nreverent and discreet, appears to me far from satisfactory. They will\r\nattribute a too closely philosophic, or excessively poetic meaning to\r\na plain and simple fact. Sometimes the respect which great composers\'\r\nnames command will cause inferior examples to be quoted as good; cases\r\nof carelessness or ignorance, easily explained by the imperfections of\r\ncurrent technique, give rise to whole pages of laborious exposition,\r\nin defence, or even in admiration of a faulty passage.\r\n\r\nThis book is written for those who have already studied\r\ninstrumentation from Gevaert\'s excellent treatise, or any other\r\nwell-known manual, and who have some knowledge of a number of\r\norchestral scores.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore only just touch on such technical questions as\r\nfingering, range, emission of sound etc.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: A short review of these various questions forms the first\r\nchapter of the book. (Editor\'s note.)]\r\n\r\nThe present work deals with the combination of instruments in separate\r\ngroups and in the entire orchestral scheme; the different means of\r\nproducing strength of tone and unity of structure; the sub-division of\r\nparts; variety of colour and expression in scoring,--the whole,\r\nprincipally from the standpoint of dramatic music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REVIEW OF ORCHESTRAL GROUPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Stringed Instruments.\r\n\r\nThe following is the formation of the string quartet and the number of\r\nplayers required in present day orchestras, either in the theatre or\r\nconcert-room.\r\n\r\n--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n              | Full      | Medium    | Small     |\r\n              | orchestra | orchestra | orchestra |\r\n--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n              |           |           |           |\r\nViolins I     |   16      |   12      |   8       |\r\n              |           |           |           |\r\n   "   II     |   14      |   10      |   6       |\r\n              |           |           |           |\r\nViolas        |   12      |    8      |   4       |\r\n              |           |           |           |\r\nVioloncellos  |   10      |    6      |   3       |\r\n              |           |           |           |\r\nDouble basses | 8-10      |  4-6      | 2-3       |\r\n--------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nIn larger orchestras, the number of first violins may amount to 20 and\r\neven 24, the other strings being increased proportionately. But such a\r\ngreat quantity of strings overpowers the customary wood-wind section,\r\nand entails re-inforcing the latter. Sometimes orchestras contain less\r\nthan 8 first violins; this is a mistake, as the balance between\r\nstrings and wind is completely destroyed. In writing for the orchestra\r\nit is advisable to rely on a medium-sized body of strings. Played by a\r\nlarger orchestra a work will be heard to greater advantage; played by\r\na smaller one, the harm done will be minimised.\r\n\r\nWhenever a group of strings is written for more than five\r\nparts--without taking double notes or chords into consideration--these\r\nparts may be increased by dividing each one into two, three and four\r\nsections, or even more (_divisi_). Generally, one or more of the\r\nprincipal parts is split up, the first or second violins, violas or\r\nvioloncellos. The players are then divided by desks, numbers 1, 3, 5\r\netc. playing the upper part, and 2, 4, 6 etc., the lower; or else the\r\nmusician on the right-hand of each desk plays the top line, the one on\r\nthe left the bottom line. Dividing by threes is less easy, as the\r\nnumber of players in one group is not always divisible by three, and\r\nhence the difficulty of obtaining proper balance. Nevertheless there\r\nare cases where the composer should not hesitate to employ this method\r\nof dividing the strings, leaving it to the conductor to ensure\r\nequality of tone. It is always as well to mark how the passage is to\r\nbe divided in the score; Vns I, 1, 2, 3 desks, 6 \'Cellos div. \xc3\xa0 3,\r\nand so on. Division into four and more parts is rare, but may be used\r\nin _piano_ passages, as it greatly reduces volume of tone in the group\r\nof strings.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In small orchestras passages sub-divided into many\r\n     parts are very hard to realise, and the effect obtained is\r\n     never the one required.\r\n\r\nString parts may be divided thus:\r\n\r\n_a_ {Vns I div.  _b_ {Vns II div.  _c_ {Violas div.  _d_ {\'Cellos div.\r\n    {Vns II div.     {Violas div.      {\'Cellos div.     {D. basses div.\r\n\r\nPossible combinations less frequently used are:\r\n\r\n_e_ {Vns I div.    _f_ {Vns II div.   _g_ {Violas div.\r\n    {Violas div.       {\'Cellos div.      {D. basses div. etc.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ It is evident that the tone quality in _b_ and _e_\r\n     will be similar. Still _b_ is preferable since the number of\r\n     Vns II (14-10-6) and Violas (12-8-4) is practically the\r\n     same, the respective r\xc3\xb4les of the two groups are more\r\n     closely allied, and from the fact that second violins\r\n     generally sit nearer to the violas than the first, thereby\r\n     guaranteeing greater unity in power and execution.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find all manner of divisions in the musical examples\r\ngiven in Vol. II. Where necessary, some explanation as to the method\r\nof dividing strings will follow in due course. I dwell on the subject\r\nhere in order to show how the usual composition of the string quartet\r\nmay be altered.\r\n\r\nStringed instruments possess more ways of producing sound than any\r\nother orchestral group. They can pass, better than other instruments\r\nfrom one shade of expression to another, the varieties being of an\r\ninfinite number. Species of bowing such as _legato_, detached,\r\n_staccato_, _spiccato_, _portamento_, _martellato_, light _staccato_,\r\n_saltando_, attack at the nut and at the point, [symbol: down bow] and\r\n[symbol: up bow] (down bow and up bow), in every degree of tone,\r\n_fortissimo_, _pianissimo_, _crescendo_, _diminuendo_, _sforzando_,\r\n_morendo_--all this belongs to the natural realm of the string\r\nquartet.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these instruments are capable of playing double notes\r\nand full chords across three and four strings--to say nothing of\r\nsub-division of parts--renders them not only melodic but also harmonic\r\nin character.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: To give a list of easy three and four-note chords, or to\r\nexplain the different methods of bowing does not come within the scope\r\nof the present book.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of activity and flexibility the violin takes\r\npride of place among stringed instruments, then, in order, come the\r\nviola, \'cello and double bass. In practice the notes of extreme limit\r\nin the string quartet should be fixed as follows:\r\n\r\nfor violins: [Music: A7], for violas: [Music: A5],\r\nfor \'cellos: [Music: A4], for double basses: [Music: G4].\r\n\r\nHigher notes given in Table A, should only be used with caution, that\r\nis to say when they are of long value, in _tremolando_, slow, flowing\r\nmelodies, in not too rapid sequence of scales, and in passages of\r\nrepeated notes. Skips should always be avoided.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In quick passages for stringed instruments long\r\n     chromatic figures are never suitable; they are difficult to\r\n     play and sound indistinct and muddled. Such passages are\r\n     better allotted to the wood-wind.\r\n\r\nA limit should be set to the use of a high note on any one of the\r\nthree lower strings on violins, violas and \'cellos. This note should\r\nbe the one in the fourth position, either the octave note or the ninth\r\nof the open string.\r\n\r\nNobility, warmth, and equality of tone from one end of the scale to\r\nthe other are qualities common to all stringed instruments, and render\r\nthem essentially superior to instruments of other groups. Further,\r\neach string has a distinctive character of its own, difficult to\r\ndefine in words. The top string on the violin (_E_) is brilliant in\r\ncharacter, that of the viola (_A_) is more biting in quality and\r\nslightly nasal; the highest string on the \'cello (_A_) is bright and\r\npossesses a "chest-voice" timbre. The _A_ and _D_ strings on the\r\nviolin and the _D_ string on the violas and \'cellos are somewhat\r\nsweeter and weaker in tone than the others. Covered strings (_G_), on\r\nthe violin (_G_ and _C_), on the viola and \'cello are rather harsh.\r\nSpeaking generally, the double bass is equally resonant throughout,\r\nslightly duller on the two lower strings (_E_ and _A_), and more\r\npenetrating on the upper ones (_D_ and _G_).\r\n\r\n     _Note._ Except in the case of pedal notes, the double bass\r\n     rarely plays an independent part, usually moving in octaves\r\n     or in unison with the \'cellos, or else doubling the\r\n     bassoons. The quality of the double bass tone is therefore\r\n     seldom heard by itself and the character of its different\r\n     strings is not so noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe rare ability to connect sounds, or a series of sounds, the\r\nvibration of stopped strings combined with their above-named\r\nqualities--warmth and nobility of tone--renders this group of\r\ninstruments far and away the best orchestral medium of melodic\r\nexpression. At the same time, that portion of their range situated\r\nbeyond the limits of the human voice, e.g. notes on the violin higher\r\nthan the extreme top note of the soprano voice, from\r\n\r\n[Music: E6]\r\n\r\nupwards, and notes on the double bass below the range of the bass\r\nvoice, descending from\r\n\r\n[Music: D3] (written sound)\r\n\r\nlose in expression and warmth of tone. Open strings are clearer and\r\nmore powerful but less expressive than stopped strings.\r\n\r\nComparing the range of each stringed instrument with that of the human\r\nvoice, we may assign: to the violin, the soprano and contralto voice\r\nplus a much higher range; to the viola, the contralto and tenor voice\r\nplus a much higher register; to the \'cello, the tenor and bass voices\r\nplus a higher register; to the double bass, the bass voice plus a\r\nlower range.\r\n\r\nThe use of harmonics, the mute, and some special devices in bowing\r\nproduce great difference in the resonance and tone quality of all\r\nthese instruments.\r\n\r\nHarmonics, frequently used today, alter the timbre of a stringed\r\ninstrument to a very appreciable extent. Cold and transparent in soft\r\npassages, cold and brilliant in loud ones, and offering but little\r\nchance for expression, they form no fundamental part of orchestral\r\nwriting, and are used simply for ornament. Owing to their lack of\r\nresonant power they should be used sparingly, and, when employed,\r\nshould never be overpowered by other instruments. As a rule harmonics\r\nare employed on sustained notes, _tremolando_, or here and there for\r\nbrilliant effects; they are rarely used in extremely simple melodies.\r\nOwing to a certain tonal affinity with the flute they may be said to\r\nform a kind of link between string and wood-wind instruments.\r\n\r\nAnother radical change is effected by the use of mutes. When muted,\r\nthe clear, singing tone of the strings becomes dull in soft passages,\r\nturns to a slight hiss or whistle in loud ones, and the volume of tone\r\nis always greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe position of the bow on the string will affect the resonance of an\r\ninstrument. Playing with the bow close to the bridge (_sul\r\nponticello_), chiefly used _tremolando_, produces a metallic sound;\r\nplaying on the finger-board (_sul tasto_, _flautando_) creates a dull,\r\nveiled effect.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ Another absolutely different sound results from\r\n     playing with the back or wood of the bow (_col legno_). This\r\n     produces a sound like a xylophone or a hollow _pizzicato_.\r\n     It is discussed under the heading of instruments of little\r\n     sustaining power.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable A. String group.\r\n\r\n(These instruments give all chromatic intervals.)\r\n\r\nViolin.\r\n(I. II.)\r\n\r\nViola.\r\n\r\nVioloncello.\r\n\r\nDouble bass.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack lines on each string denote the general range in orchestral\r\nwriting, the dotted lines give the registers, low, medium, high, very\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nThe five sets of strings with number of players given above produce a\r\nfairly even balance of tone. If there is any surplus of strength it\r\nmust be on the side of the first violins, as they must be heard\r\ndistinctly on account of the important part they play in the harmonic\r\nscheme. Besides this, an extra desk of first violins is usual in all\r\norchestras, and as a general rule they possess a more powerful tone\r\nthan second violins. The latter, with the violas, play a secondary\r\npart, and do not stand out so prominently. The \'cellos and double\r\nbasses are heard more distinctly, and in the majority of cases form\r\nthe bass in octaves.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be said that the group of strings, as a melodic\r\nelement, is able to perform all manner of passages, rapid and\r\ninterrupted phrases of every description, diatonic or chromatic in\r\ncharacter. Capable of sustaining notes without difficulty, of playing\r\nchords of three and four notes; adapted to the infinite variety of\r\nshades of expression, and easily divisible into numerous sundry parts,\r\nthe string group in an orchestra may be considered as an harmonic\r\nelement particularly rich in resource.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Wind instruments.\r\n\r\nWood-wind.\r\n\r\nApart from the varying number of players, the formation of the string\r\ngroup, with its five constituent parts remains constant, satisfying\r\nthe demands of any orchestral full score. On the other hand the group\r\nof wood-wind instruments varies both as regards number of parts and\r\nthe volume of tone at its command, and here the composer may choose at\r\nwill. The group may be divided into three general classes: wood-wind\r\ninstruments in pair\'s, in three\'s and in four\'s, (see table on page\r\n13).\r\n\r\nArabic numerals denote the number of players on each instrument; roman\r\nfigures, the parts (1st, 2nd etc.). Instruments which do not\r\nrequire additional players, but are taken over by one or the other\r\nexecutant in place of his usual instrument, are enclosed in brackets.\r\nAs a rule the first flute, first oboe, first clarinet and first\r\nbassoon never change instruments; considering the importance of their\r\nparts it is not advisable for them to turn from one mouth-piece to\r\nanother. The parts written for piccolo, bass flute, English horn,\r\nsmall clarinet, bass clarinet and double bassoon are taken by the\r\nsecond and third players in each group, who are more accustomed to\r\nusing these instruments of a special nature.\r\n\r\n---------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n   Wood-wind         |     Wood-wind            |     Wood-wind           |\r\n   in pair\'s         |     in three\'s           |     in four\'s           |\r\n---------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n                     |                          |                         |\r\n  (II--Piccolo).     |    (III--Piccolo).       |    1 Piccolo (IV).      |\r\n                     |                          |                         |\r\n  2 Flutes I.

Sometimes a composer writes for two\r\npiccolos or two Eng. horns etc. without increasing the original number\r\nof players required (in three\'s or four\'s).\r\n\r\n     _Note I._ Composers using the first class in the course of a\r\n     big work (oratorio, opera, symphony, etc.) may introduce\r\n     special instruments, called _extras_, for a long or short\r\n     period of time; each of these instruments involves an extra\r\n     player not required throughout the entire work. Meyerbeer\r\n     was fond of doing this, but other composers, Glinka for\r\n     example, refrain from increasing the number of performers by\r\n     employing _extras_ (Eng. horn part in _Roussl\xc3\xa2n_). Wagner\r\n     uses all three classes in the above table (in pair\'s:\r\n     _Tannh\xc3\xa4user_--in three\'s: _Tristan_--in four\'s: _The Ring_).\r\n\r\n     _Note II._ _Mlada_ is the only work of mine involving\r\n     formation by four\'s. _Ivan the Terrible_, _Sadko_, _The\r\n     Legend of Tsar Saltan_, _The Legend of the Invisible City of\r\n     Kitesh_ and _The Golden Cockerel_ all belong to the second\r\n     class, and in my other works, wood-wind in pair\'s is used\r\n     with a varying number of extras. _The Christmas Night_, with\r\n     its two oboes, and two bassoons, three flutes and three\r\n     clarinets, forms an intermediate class.\r\n\r\nConsidering the instruments it comprises, the string group offers a\r\nfair variety of colour, and contrast in compass, but this diversity of\r\nrange and timbre is subtle and not easily discerned. In the wood-wind\r\ndepartment, however, the difference in register and quality of flutes,\r\noboes, clarinets and bassoons is striking to a degree. As a rule,\r\nwood-wind instruments are less flexible than strings; they lack the\r\nvitality and power, and are less capable of different shade of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nIn each wind instrument I have defined the _scope of greatest\r\nexpression_, that is to say the range in which the instrument is best\r\nqualified to achieve the various grades of tone, (_forte_, _piano_,\r\n_cresc._, _dim._, _sforzando_, _morendo_, etc.)--the register which\r\nadmits of the most _expressive_ playing, in the truest sense of the\r\nword. Outside this range, a wind instrument is more notable for\r\nrichness of colour than for expression. I am probably the originator\r\nof the term "scope of greatest expression". It does not apply to the\r\npiccolo and double bassoon which represent the two extremes of the\r\norchestral compass. They do not possess such a register and belong to\r\nthe body of highly-coloured but non-expressive instruments.\r\n\r\nThe four kinds of wind instruments: flutes, oboes, clarinets and\r\nbassoons may be generally considered to be of equal power. The same\r\ncannot be said of instruments which fulfil a special purpose: piccolo,\r\nbass flute, Eng. horn, small clarinet, bass clarinet and double\r\nbassoon. Each of these instruments has four registers: low, middle,\r\nhigh and extremely high, each of which is characterised by certain\r\ndifferences of quality and power. It is difficult to define the exact\r\nlimits of each register; adjacent registers almost blend together and\r\nthe passage from one to another is scarcely noticeable. But when the\r\ninstrument jumps from one register to another the difference in power\r\nand quality of tone is very striking.\r\n\r\nThe four families of wind instruments may be divided into two classes:\r\na) instruments of nasal quality and dark resonance--oboes and bassoons\r\n(Eng. horn and double bassoon); and b) instruments of "chest-voice"\r\nquality and bright tone--flutes and clarinets (piccolo, bass flute,\r\nsmall clarinet, bass clarinet).\r\n\r\nThese characteristics of colour and resonance--expressed in too simple\r\nand rudimentary a form--are specially noticeable in the middle and\r\nupper registers. The lower register of the oboes and bassoons is thick\r\nand rough, yet still nasal in quality; the very high compass is\r\nshrill, hard and dry. The clear resonance of the flutes and clarinets\r\nacquires something nasal and dark in the lower compass; in the very\r\nhigh register it becomes somewhat piercing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to Table B.\r\n\r\n     In the following Table B the top note in each register\r\n     serves as the bottom note in the next, as the limits to each\r\n     register are not defined absolutely. The note _G_ fixes the\r\n     register of flutes and oboes, _C_ for the clarinets and\r\n     bassoons. In the very high compass those notes are only\r\n     given which can really be used; anything higher and not\r\n     printed as actual notes are either too difficult to produce\r\n     or of no artistic value. The number of sounds obtainable in\r\n     the highest compass is indefinite, and depends, partly on\r\n     the quality of the instrument itself, partly on the position\r\n     and application of the lips. The signs [music symbol:\r\n     decrescendo] [music symbol: crescendo] are not to be\r\n     mistaken for _crescendo_ and _diminuendo_; they indicate how\r\n     the resonance of an instrument increases or diminishes in\r\n     relation to the characteristic quality of its timbre. The\r\n     scope of greatest expression for each typical instrument is\r\n     marked thus, [symbol: horizontal bracket] under the notes; the\r\n     range is the same in each instrument of the same type.\r\n\r\nTable B.

Though borrowed from these senses, I have no\r\n     doubt as to the appropriateness of my comparisons, but, as a\r\n     general rule definitions drawn from other sources are too\r\n     elementary to be applied to music. No condemnatory meaning\r\n     however should be attached to my descriptions, for in using\r\n     the terms thick, piercing, shrill, dry, etc. my object is to\r\n     express _artistic_ fitness in words, rather than material\r\n     exactitude. Instrumental sounds which have no musical\r\n     meaning are classed by me in the category of _useless\r\n     sounds_, and I refer to them as such, giving my reasons.\r\n     With the exception of these, the reader is advised to\r\n     consider all other orchestral timbres beautiful from an\r\n     artistic point of view, although it is necessary, at times,\r\n     to put them to other uses.\r\n\r\n     Further on, a table of wind instruments is appended,\r\n     outlining the approximate limit of range, defining different\r\n     qualities of tone and indicating the scope of greatest\r\n     expression (the piccolo and double bassoon excepted).\r\n\r\nFlutes and clarinets are the most flexible wood-wind instruments (the\r\nflutes in particular), but for expressive power and subtlety in\r\n_nuances_ the clarinet supersedes them; this instrument can reduce\r\nvolume of tone to a mere breath. The nasal instruments, oboe and\r\nbassoon, are less mobile and supple; this is accounted for by their\r\ndouble reed, but, having to effect all sorts of scales and rapid\r\npassages in common with the flutes and clarinets, oboes and bassoons\r\nmay be considered melodic instruments in the real sense of the word,\r\nonly of a more _cantabile_ and peaceful character. In very quick\r\npassages they often double the flutes, clarinets or strings.\r\n\r\nThe four families are equally capable of _legato_ and _staccato_\r\nplaying and changing from one to the other in different ways, but\r\ndistinct and penetrating _staccato_ passages are better suited to the\r\noboes and bassoons, while the flutes and clarinets excel in\r\nwell-sustained _legato_ phrases. Composite _legato_ passages should be\r\nallotted to the first two instruments, composite _staccato_ passages\r\nto the latter pair, but these general directions should not deter the\r\norchestrator from adopting the opposite plan.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the technical individualities of the wood-wind the\r\nfollowing fundamental differences should be noted:\r\n\r\na) The rapid repetition of a single note by single tonguing is common\r\nto all wind instruments; repetition of a single note by means of\r\ndouble tonguing is only possible on the flute, a reedless instrument.\r\n\r\nb) On account of its construction the clarinet is not well adapted to\r\nsudden leaps from one octave to another; these skips are easier on\r\nflutes, oboes and bassoons.\r\n\r\nc) _Arpeggios_ and rapid alternation of two intervals _legato_ sound\r\nwell on flutes and clarinets, but not on oboes and bassoons.\r\n\r\nWood-wind players cannot manage extremely long sustained passages, as\r\nthey are compelled to take breath; care must be taken therefore to\r\ngive them a little rest from time to time. This is unnecessary in the\r\ncase of string players.\r\n\r\nIn the endeavour to characterise the timbre of each instrument typical\r\nof the four families, from a psychological point of view, I do not\r\nhesitate to make the following general remarks which apply generally\r\nto the middle and upper registers of each instrument:\r\n\r\na) Flute.--Cold in quality, specially suitable, in the major key, to\r\nmelodies of light and graceful character; in the minor key, to slight\r\ntouches of transient sorrow.\r\n\r\nb) Oboe.--Artless and gay in the major, pathetic and sad in the minor.\r\n\r\nc) Clarinet.--Pliable and expressive, suitable, in the major, to\r\nmelodies of a joyful or contemplative character, or to outbursts of\r\nmirth; in the minor, to sad and reflective melodies or impassioned and\r\ndramatic passages.\r\n\r\nd) Bassoon.--In the major, an atmosphere of senile mockery; a sad,\r\nailing quality in the minor.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme registers these instruments convey the following\r\nimpressions to my mind:\r\n\r\n                _Low register_         _Very high register_\r\n\r\na) Flute--      Dull, cold             Brilliant\r\nb) Oboe--       Wild                   Hard, dry\r\nc) Clarinet--   Ringing, threatening   Piercing\r\nd) Bassoon--    Sinister               Tense.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ It is true that no mood or frame of mind, whether it\r\n     be joyful or sad, meditative or lively, careless or\r\n     reflective, mocking or distressed can be aroused by one\r\n     single isolated timbre; it depends more upon the general\r\n     melodic line, the harmony, rhythm, and dynamic shades of\r\n     expression, upon the whole formation of a given piece of\r\n     music. The choice of instruments and timbre to be adopted\r\n     depends on the position which melody and harmony occupy in\r\n     the seven-octave scale of the orchestra; for example, a\r\n     melody of light character in the tenor register could not be\r\n     given to the flutes, or a sad, plaintive phrase in the high\r\n     soprano register confided to the bassoons. But the ease with\r\n     which tone colour can be adapted to expression must not be\r\n     forgotten, and in the first of these two cases it may be\r\n     conceded that the mocking character of the bassoon could\r\n     easily and quite naturally assume a light-hearted aspect,\r\n     and in the second case, that the slightly melancholy timbre\r\n     of the flute is somewhat related to the feeling of sorrow\r\n     and distress with which the passage is to be permeated. The\r\n     case of a melody coinciding in character with the instrument\r\n     on which it is played is of special importance, as the\r\n     effect produced cannot fail to be successful. There are also\r\n     moments when a composer\'s artistic feeling prompts him to\r\n     employ instruments, the character of which is at variance\r\n     with the written melody (for eccentric, grotesque effects,\r\n     etc.).\r\n\r\nThe following remarks illustrate the characteristics, timbre, and\r\nemployment of special instruments:\r\n\r\nThe duty of the piccolo and small clarinet is, principally, to extend\r\nthe range of the ordinary flute and clarinet in the high register. The\r\nwhistling, piercing quality of the piccolo in its highest compass is\r\nextraordinarily powerful, but does not lend itself to more moderate\r\nshades of expression. The small clarinet in its highest register is\r\nmore penetrating than the ordinary clarinet. The low and middle range\r\nof the piccolo and small clarinet correspond to the same register in\r\nthe normal flute and clarinet, but the tone is so much weaker that it\r\nis of little service in those regions. The double bassoon extends the\r\nrange of the ordinary bassoon in the low register. The characteristics\r\nof the bassoon\'s low compass are still further accentuated in the\r\ncorresponding range of the double bassoon, but the middle and upper\r\nregisters of the latter are by no means so useful. The very deep notes\r\nof the double bassoon are remarkably thick and dense in quality, very\r\npowerful in _piano_ passages.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ Nowadays, when the limits of the orchestral scale\r\n     are considerably extended (up to the high _C_ of the 7th\r\n     octave, and down to the low _C_, 16 ft. contra octave), the\r\n     piccolo forms an indispensable constituent of the\r\n     wind-group; similarly, it is recognised that the double\r\n     bassoon is capable of supplying valuable assistance. The\r\n     small clarinet is rarely employed and only for colour\r\n     effects.\r\n\r\nThe English horn, or alto oboe (oboe in _F_) is similar in tone to the\r\nordinary oboe, the listless, dreamy quality of its timbre being sweet\r\nin the extreme. In the low register it is fairly penetrating. The bass\r\nclarinet, though strongly resembling the ordinary clarinet, is of\r\ndarker colour in the low register and lacks the silvery quality in the\r\nupper notes; it is incapable of joyful expression. The bass flute is\r\nan instrument seldom used even today; it possesses the same features\r\nas the flute, but it is colder in colour, and crystalline in the\r\nmiddle and high regions. These three particular instruments, apart\r\nfrom extending the low registers of the instruments to which they\r\nbelong, have their own distinctive peculiarities of timbre, and are\r\noften used in the orchestra, as solo instruments, clearly exposed.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ Of the six special instruments referred to above,\r\n     the piccolo and double bassoon were the first to be used in\r\n     the orchestra; the latter, however, was neglected after\r\n     Beethoven\'s death and did not reappear until towards the end\r\n     of the 19th century. The Eng. horn and bass clarinet were\r\n     employed initially during the first half of the same century\r\n     by Berlioz, Meyerbeer, and others, and for some time\r\n     retained their position as _extras_, to become, later on,\r\n     permanent orchestral factors, first in the theatre, then in\r\n     the concert room. Very few attempts have been made to\r\n     introduce the small clarinet into the orchestra (Berlioz\r\n     etc.); this instrument together with the bass flute is used\r\n     in my opera-ballet _Mlada_ (1892), and also in my most\r\n     recent compositions, _The Christmas Night_, and _Sadko_; the\r\n     bass flute will also be found in _The Legend of the\r\n     Invisible City of Kitesh_, and in the revised version of\r\n     "_Ivan the Terrible_".\r\n\r\nOf late years the habit of muting the wood-wind has come into fashion.\r\nThis is done by inserting a soft pad, or a piece of rolled-up cloth\r\ninto the bell of the instrument. Mutes deaden the tone of oboes, Eng.\r\nhorns, and bassoons to such an extent that it is possible for these\r\ninstruments to attain the extreme limit of _pianissimo_ playing. The\r\nmuting of clarinets is unnecessary, as they can play quite softly\r\nenough without artificial means. It has not yet been discovered how to\r\nmute the flutes; such a discovery would render great service to the\r\npiccolo. The lowest notes on the bassoon,\r\n\r\n[Music: B1] and on the oboe and Eng. horn [Music: B3]\r\n\r\nare impossible when the instruments are muted. Mutes have no effect in\r\nthe highest register of wind instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrass.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the group of brass instruments, like that of the\r\nwood-wind is not absolutely uniform, and varies in different scores.\r\nThe brass group may be divided into three general classes\r\ncorresponding to those of the wood-wind (in pair\'s, in three\'s, and in\r\nfour\'s).\r\n\r\n----------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n Group corresponding  |  Group corresponding    |  Group corresponding    |\r\n  to the wood-wind    |   to the wood-wind      |    to the wood-wind     |\r\n     in pair\'s        |      in three\'s         |       in four\'s         |\r\n----------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------|\r\n                      |                         |  (II--Small trumpet).   |\r\n  2 Trumpets I, II.   | 3 Trumpets I, II, III.  | 3 Trumpets I, II, III.  |\r\n                      |  (III--Alto trumpet     |  (III--Alto trumpet or  |\r\n                      |         or:             |     Bass trumpet.)      |\r\n                      |  {2 Cornets I, II.      |                         |\r\n                      |  {2 Trumpets I, II.)    |                         |\r\n                      |                         |                         |\r\n  4 Horns I, II,      | 4 Horns I, II, III, IV. | 6 or 8 Horns I, II,     |\r\n          III, IV.    |                         |         III, IV, V,     |\r\n                      |                         |      VI, VII, VIII.     |\r\n                      |                         |                         |\r\n   3 Trombones.       | 3 Trombones I, II, III. | 3 Trombones I, II, III. |\r\n                      |                         |                         |\r\n      1 Tuba.         |     1 Tuba[8].          |       1 Tuba.           |\r\n----------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Of late years sometimes two tubas are employed, by\r\nGlazounov for instance in his Finnish Fantasia. (Editor\'s note.)]\r\n\r\nThe directions are the same as in the preceding table for wood-wind.\r\nIt is evident that in all three classes the formation may vary as the\r\ncomposer wishes. In music for the theatre or concert room page after\r\npage may be written without the use of trumpets, trombones and tuba,\r\nor some instrument may be introduced, temporarily as an _extra_. In\r\nthe above table I have given the most typical formations, and those\r\nwhich are the most common at the present day.\r\n\r\n     _Note I._ Besides the instruments given above, Richard\r\n     Wagner used some others in _The Ring_, notably the quartet\r\n     of tenor and bass tubas, and a contrabass trombone.\r\n     Sometimes these additions weigh too heavily on the other\r\n     groups, and at other times they render the rest of the brass\r\n     ineffective. For this reason composers have doubtless\r\n     refrained from employing such instruments, and Wagner\r\n     himself did not include them in the score of _Parsifal_.\r\n     Some present-day composers (Richard Strauss, Scriabine)\r\n     write for as many as five trumpets.\r\n\r\n     _Note II._ From the middle of the 19th century onward the\r\n     natural brass disappeared from the orchestra, giving place\r\n     to valve instruments. In my second opera, _The May Night_ I\r\n     used natural horns and trumpets, changing the keys, and\r\n     writing the best notes "stopped"; this was purposely done\r\n     for practise.\r\n\r\nThough far less flexible than the wood-wind, brass instruments\r\nheighten the effect of other orchestral groups by their powerful\r\nresonance. Trumpets, trombones, and tubas are about equal in\r\nstrength; cornets have not quite the same force; horns, in _forte_\r\npassages, are about one half as strong, but _piano_, they have the\r\nsame weight as other brass instruments played softly. To obtain an\r\nequal balance, therefore, the marks of expression in the horns should\r\nbe one degree stronger than in the rest of the brass; if the trumpets\r\nand trombones play _pp_, the horns should be marked _p_. On the other\r\nhand, to obtain a proper balance in _forte_ passages, two horns are\r\nneeded to one trumpet or one trombone.\r\n\r\nBrass instruments are so similar in range and timbre that the\r\ndiscussion of register is unnecessary. As a general rule quality\r\nbecomes more brilliant as the higher register is approached, and _vice\r\nversa_, with a decrease in tone. Played _pp_ the resonance is sweet;\r\nplayed _ff_ the tone is hard and "crackling". Brass instruments\r\npossess a remarkable capacity for swelling from _pianissimo_ to\r\n_fortissimo_, and reducing the tone inversely, the _sf_ [music symbol:\r\ndecrescendo] _p_ effect being excellent.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks as to character and tone quality may be added:\r\n\r\na) 1. _Trumpets_ (_B[flat]-A_). Clear and fairly penetrating in tone,\r\nstirring and rousing in _forte_ passages; in _piano_ phrases the high\r\nnotes are full and silvery, the low notes troubled, as though\r\nthreatening danger.\r\n\r\n2. _Alto trumpet_ (in _F_). An instrument of my own invention, first\r\nused by me in the opera-ballet _Mlada_. In the deep register (notes 2\r\nto 3 in the trumpet scale) it possesses a fuller, clearer, and finer\r\ntone. Two ordinary trumpets with an alto trumpet produce greater\r\nsmoothness and equality in resonance than three ordinary trumpets.\r\nSatisfied with the beauty and usefulness of the alto trumpet, I have\r\nconsistently written for it in my later works, combined with wood-wind\r\nin three\'s.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ To obviate the difficulty of using the alto trumpet\r\n     in ordinary theatres and some concert rooms, I have not\r\n     brought into play the last four notes of its lowest register\r\n     or their neighbouring chromatics; by this means the alto\r\n     trumpet part may be played by an ordinary trumpet in _B[flat]_\r\n     or _A_.\r\n\r\n3. _Small trumpet_ (in _E[flat]-D_). Invented by me and used for the\r\nfirst time in _Mlada_ to realise the very high trumpet notes without\r\ndifficulty. In tonality and range the instrument is similar to the\r\nsoprano cornet in a military band.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ The small trumpet, (_B[flat]-A_) sounding an octave\r\n     higher than the ordinary trumpet has not yet appeared in\r\n     musical literature.\r\n\r\nb) _Cornets_ (in _B[flat]-A_). Possessing a quality of tone similar to\r\nthe trumpet, but softer and weaker. It is a beautiful instrument\r\nthough rarely employed today in theatre or concert room. Expert\r\nplayers can imitate the cornet tone on the trumpet, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nc) _Horn_ (in _F_). The tone of this instrument is soft, poetical, and\r\nfull of beauty. In the lower register it is dark and brilliant; round\r\nand full in the upper. The middle notes resemble those of the bassoon\r\nand the two instruments blend well together. The horn, therefore,\r\nserves as a link between the brass and wood-wind. In spite of valves\r\nthe horn has but little mobility and would seem to produce its tone in\r\na languid and lazy manner.\r\n\r\nd) _Trombone._ Dark and threatening in the deepest register, brilliant\r\nand triumphant in the high compass. The _piano_ is full but somewhat\r\nheavy, the _forte_ powerful and sonorous. Valve trombones are more\r\nmobile than slide trombones, but the latter are certainly to be\r\npreferred as regards nobility and equality of sound, the more so from\r\nthe fact that these instruments are rarely required to perform quick\r\npassages, owing to the special character of their tone.\r\n\r\ne) _Tuba._ Thick and rough in quality, less characteristic than the\r\ntrombone, but valuable for the strength and beauty of its low notes.\r\nLike the double bass and double bassoon, the tuba is eminently useful\r\nfor doubling, an octave lower, the bass of the group to which it\r\nbelongs. Thanks to its valves, the tuba is fairly flexible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable C. Brass group.\r\n\r\nThese instruments give all chromatic intervals.\r\n\r\nTrumpet, Cornet.\r\n(_B[flat]-A, alto in F_).[A]\r\n\r\nHorn\r\n(_F, E_).\r\n\r\nTrombone\r\n(tenor-bass).[B]\r\n\r\nTuba\r\n(_C_-bass).\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nNatural sounds are given in white notes. The upper lines indicate the\r\nscope of greatest expression.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The 7th natural harmonic is everywhere omitted as\r\nuseless; the same in the horns, the notes 11, 13, 14 and 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: The _b[natural]_ of the octave -1 does not exist on the\r\ntrombones.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group of brass instruments, though uniform in resonance throughout\r\nits constituent parts, is not so well adapted to expressive playing\r\n(in the exact sense of the word) as the wood-wind group. Nevertheless,\r\na scope of greatest expression may be distinguished in the middle\r\nregisters. In company with the piccolo and double bassoon it is not\r\ngiven to the small trumpet (_E[flat]-D_) and tuba to play with any great\r\namount of expression. The rapid and rhythmical repetition of a note by\r\nsingle tonguing is possible to all members of the brass, but double\r\ntonguing can only be done on instruments with a small mouth-piece,\r\ntrumpets and cornets. These two instruments can execute rapid\r\n_tremolando_ without difficulty. The remarks on breathing, in the\r\nsection devoted to the wood-wind, apply with equal force to the brass.\r\n\r\nThe use of stopped notes and mutes alters the character of brass tone.\r\nStopped notes can only be employed on trumpets, cornets and horns; the\r\nshape of trombones and tubas prevents the hand from being inserted\r\ninto the bell. Though mutes are applied indiscriminately to all brass\r\ninstruments in the orchestra, tubas rarely possess them. Stopped and\r\nmuted notes are similar in quality. On the trumpet, muting a note\r\nproduces a better tone than stopping it.\r\n\r\nIn the horn both methods are employed; single notes are stopped in\r\nshort phrases, muted in longer ones. I do not propose to describe the\r\ndifference between the two operations in detail, and will leave the\r\nreader to acquire the knowledge for himself, and to form an opinion as\r\nto its importance from his own personal observation. Sufficient to say\r\nthat the tone is deadened by both methods, assuming a wild "crackling"\r\ncharacter in _forte_ passages, tender and dull in _piano_. Resonance\r\nis greatly reduced, the silvery tone of the instrument so lost and a\r\ntimbre resembling that of the oboe and Eng. horn is approached.\r\nStopped notes (_con sordino_) are marked [music symbol: mute]\r\nunderneath the note, sometimes followed by [music symbol: no mute],\r\ndenoting the resumption of open sounds, _senza sordini_. Brass\r\ninstruments, when muted, produce an effect of distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Instruments of little sustaining power.\r\n\r\nPlucked strings.\r\n\r\nWhen the usual orchestral string quartet (Vns I, Vns II, Violas,\r\n\'Cellos, D. basses) does not make use of the bow, but plucks the\r\nstrings with the finger, it becomes to my mind a new and independent\r\ngroup with its own particular quality of tone. Associated with the\r\nharp, which produces sound in a similar manner, I consider it\r\nseparately under the heading of plucked strings.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In this group may be classed the guitar, zither,\r\n     balala\xc3\xafka; instruments plucked with a quill, such as the\r\n     domra,[9] the mandoline etc., all of which may be used in an\r\n     orchestra, but have no place in the scope of the present\r\n     book.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: A Russian instrument which, like the balala\xc3\xafka, is better\r\nknown abroad. (Translator\'s note.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPizzicato.\r\n\r\nAlthough capable of every degree of power from _ff_ to _pp_,\r\n_pizzicato_ playing has but small range of expression, and is used\r\nchiefly as a colour effect. On open strings it is resonant and heavy,\r\non stopped strings shorter and duller; in the high positions it is\r\nrather dry and hard.\r\n\r\nTable D on page 31 indicates the range in which _pizzicato_ may be\r\nused on each stringed instrument.\r\n\r\nIn the orchestra, _pizzicato_ comes into operation in two distinct\r\nways: a) on single notes, b) on double notes and chords. The fingers\r\nof the right hand playing _pizz._ are far less agile than the bow;\r\n_pizz._ passages therefore can never be performed as quickly as those\r\nplayed _arco_. Moreover, the speed of _pizzicato_ playing depends upon\r\nthe thickness of the strings; on the double basses, for instance, it\r\nmust always be much slower than on the violins.\r\n\r\nIn _pizzicato_ chords it is better to avoid open strings, which\r\nproduce a more brilliant tone than of covered strings. Chords of four\r\nnotes allow of greater freedom and vigour of attack, as there is no\r\ndanger of accidentally touching a wrong note. Natural harmonics played\r\n_pizz._ create a charming effect; the tone is weak however, and they\r\nare chiefly successful on the violoncello.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarp.\r\n\r\nIn the orchestra, the harp is almost entirely an harmonic or\r\naccompanying instrument. The majority of scores require only one harp\r\npart, but in recent times composers have written for two or even three\r\nharps, which are sometimes compressed into the one part.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ Full orchestras should include three or even four\r\n     harps. My operas _Sadko_, _The Legend of the Invisible City\r\n     of Kitesh_, and _The Golden Cockerel_ are designed for two\r\n     harps, _Mlada_ for three.\r\n\r\nThe special function of the harp lies in the execution of chords, and\r\nthe florid figures springing from them. As only four notes at the most\r\ncan be played by each hand, the notes of a chord should be written\r\nclose together, with not too great a space between one hand and the\r\nother. The chords must always be broken (_arpeggiato_); should the\r\ncomposer wish otherwise he should notify it (_non arpeggiato_). In the\r\nmiddle and lower octaves the resonance of the strings is slightly\r\nprolonged, and dies away gradually. In changes of harmony the player\r\nstops the vibration of the strings with his hands, but, in quick\r\nmodulations, this method is not feasible, and the mixture of one chord\r\nwith another produces a discordant effect. It follows that more or\r\nless rapid figures can only be realised clearly and neatly in the\r\nupper register of the harp, where the strings are shorter and harder\r\nin tone.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, in the whole range of the harp:\r\n\r\n[Music: C1[flat]-F7[sharp]]\r\n\r\nonly the notes of the first to the fourth octave are used; the extreme\r\nnotes in both compasses may be employed in special circumstances, and\r\nfor doubling in octaves.\r\n\r\nThe harp is essentially a diatonic instrument, since all chromatic\r\npassages depend on the manipulation of the pedals. For this reason the\r\nharp does not lend itself to rapid modulation, and the orchestrator is\r\nadvised to bear this fact in mind. But the difficulty may be obviated\r\nby using two harps alternately.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: A chromatic harp without pedals has now been invented in\r\nFrance (Lyon\'s system), on which the most abrupt modulations are\r\npossible. (Translator\'s note.)]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ I would remind the reader that the harp is not\r\n     capable of double sharps or double flats. For this reason,\r\n     certain modulations from one key to another one, adjacent to\r\n     it can only be accomplished enharmonically. For instance,\r\n     the transition from _C_ flat, _G_ flat or _D_ flat, major to\r\n     their minor subdominant chords or keys is not possible owing\r\n     to double flats. It is therefore necessary to start\r\n     enharmonically from the keys of _B_, _F_ sharp or _C_ sharp,\r\n     major. Similarly, on account of double sharps, it is\r\n     impossible to change from _A_ sharp, _D_ sharp or _G_ sharp,\r\n     minor to their respective dominant major chords or keys; _B_\r\n     flat, _E_ flat and _A_ flat, minor must be the\r\n     starting-points.\r\n\r\nThe technical operation known as _glissando_ is peculiar to the harp\r\nalone. Taking for granted that the reader is conversant with the\r\nmethods of acquiring different scales by means of double-notched\r\npedals, it will be sufficient to remark that _glissando_ scales\r\nproduce a discordant medley of sound owing to the length of time the\r\nstrings continue to vibrate, and therefore, as a _purely musical_\r\neffect, _glissando_ can only be used in the upper octaves, quite\r\n_piano_, where the sound of the strings is sufficiently clear, yet not\r\ntoo prolonged. _Forte glissando_ scales, entailing the use of the\r\nlower and middle strings are only permissible as embellishments.\r\nGlissando passages in chords of the seventh and ninth, enharmonically\r\nobtained, are much more common, and as the above reservations do not\r\napply, every dynamic shade of tone is possible. Chords in harmonics\r\ncan only consist of three notes written close together, two for the\r\nleft hand and one for the right.\r\n\r\nThe tender poetic quality of the harp is adapted to every dynamic\r\nshade, but it is never a very powerful instrument, and the\r\norchestrator should treat it with respect.\r\n\r\nAt least three, if not four harps in unison are necessary, if they are\r\nto be heard against a full orchestra playing _forte_. The more rapidly\r\na _glissando_ passage is played, the louder it will sound. Harmonic\r\nnotes on the harp have great charm but little resonance, and are only\r\npossible played quite softly. Speaking generally, the harp, like the\r\nstring quartet, _pizzicato_, is more an instrument of colour than\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\r\nPercussion instruments producing determinate sounds, keyed\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nKettle-drums.\r\n\r\nKettle-drums, indispensable to every theatre and concert orchestra\r\noccupy the most important place in the group of percussion\r\ninstruments. A pair of kettle-drums (_Timpani_), in the tonic and\r\ndominant keys, was the necessary attribute of an orchestra up to, and\r\nincluding Beethoven\'s time, but, from the middle of the 19th\r\ncentury onward, in western Europe and in Russia, an ever-increasing\r\nneed was felt for the presence of three or even four kettle-drums,\r\nduring the whole course or part of a work. If the expensive chromatic\r\ndrum, permitting instant tuning is rarely met with, still, in the\r\nmajority of good orchestras, three screw drums are generally to be\r\nfound. The composer can therefore take it for granted that a good\r\ntimpanist, having three kettle-drums at his command, will be able to\r\ntune at least one of them during a pause of some length.\r\n\r\nThe limits of possible change in Beethoven\'s time was considered to\r\nbe:\r\n\r\nBig kettle-drum: [Music: F2-C3 (chromatically)]\r\nSmall kettle-drum: [Music: B[flat]2-F3 (chromatically)]\r\n\r\nIn these days it is difficult to define the precise extent of high\r\ncompass in the kettle-drums, as this depends entirely on the size and\r\nquality of the smallest one, of which there are many kinds, but I\r\nadvise the composer to select:\r\n\r\n[Music: E2-G[sharp]3 (chromatically)]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ A magnificent kettle-drum of very small size was\r\n     made for my opera-ballet _Mlada_; this instrument gave the\r\n     _D[flat]_ of the fourth octave.\r\n\r\nKettle-drums are capable of every dynamic shade of tone, from\r\nthundering _fortissimo_ to a barely perceptible _pianissimo_. In\r\n_tremolando_ they can execute the most gradual _crescendo_,\r\n_diminuendo_, the _sfp_ and _morendo_.\r\n\r\nTo deaden the sound, a piece of cloth is generally placed on the skin\r\nof the drum, according to the instruction: _timpani coperti_ (muffled\r\ndrums).\r\n\r\n\r\nTable D.\r\n\r\nPizzicato.\r\n\r\nViolin.\r\n\r\nViola.\r\n\r\nVioloncello.\r\n\r\nDouble bass.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe black notes are dry and hard, without resonance, and should only\r\nbe used when doubled with the wood-wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Table E.\r\n\r\nGlockenspiel, celesta, xylophone.\r\n\r\nGlockenspiel\r\n(with keyboard).\r\n\r\nGlockenspiel\r\n(ordinary).\r\n\r\nCelesta.\r\n\r\nXylophone.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n\r\nPiano and Celesta.\r\n\r\nThe use of a piano in the orchestra (apart from pianoforte concertos)\r\nbelongs almost entirely to the Russian school.[11] The object is\r\ntwo-fold: the quality of tone, either alone, or combined with that\r\nof the harp, is made to imitate a popular instrument, the guzli, (as\r\nin Glinka), or a soft peal of bells. When the piano forms part of an\r\norchestra, not as a solo instrument, an upright is preferable to a\r\ngrand, but today the piano is gradually being superseded by the\r\ncelesta, first used by Tschaikovsky. In the celesta, small steel\r\nplates take the place of strings, and the hammers falling on them\r\nproduce a delightful sound, very similar to the _glockenspiel_. The\r\ncelesta is only found in full orchestras; when it is not available it\r\nshould be replaced by an upright piano, and not the _glockenspiel_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Rimsky-Korsakov\'s opera _Sadko_ and Moussorgsky\'s _Boris\r\nGodounov_ are particularly interesting in this respect. (Translator\'s\r\nnote.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nGlockenspiel, Bells, Xylophone.\r\n\r\nThe _glockenspiel_ (_campanelli_) may be made of steel bars, or played\r\nwith a keyboard. The first type is the more satisfactory and possesses\r\ngreater resonance. The use of the _glockenspiel_ is similar to the\r\ncelesta, but its tone is more brilliant and penetrating. Big bells in\r\nthe shape of hollow discs or metal tubes,[12] or real church bells of\r\nmoderate size may be considered more as theatrical properties than\r\norchestral instruments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Recently, bells have been made of suspended metal plates\r\npossessing the rare quality of a fairly pure tone, and which are\r\nsufficiently portable to be used on the concert platform. (Editor\'s\r\nnote.)]\r\n\r\nThe xylophone is a species of harmonica composed of strips or\r\ncylinders of wood, struck with two little hammers. It produces a\r\nclattering sound, both powerful and piercing.\r\n\r\nTo complete this catalogue of sounds mention should be made of the\r\nstrings playing _col legno_, that is with the wood or back of the bow.\r\nThe sound produced is similar to the xylophone, and gains in quality\r\nas the number of players is increased.\r\n\r\nA table is appended showing the range of the celesta, _glockenspiel_\r\nand xylophone.\r\n\r\n\r\nPercussion instruments producing indefinite sounds.\r\n\r\nInstruments in this group, such as triangle, castanets, little bells,\r\ntambourine, switch or rod (_Rute._ Ger.), side or military drum,\r\ncymbals, bass drum, and Chinese gong do not take any harmonic or\r\nmelodic part in the orchestra, and can only be considered as\r\nornamental instruments pure and simple. They have no intrinsic\r\nmusical meaning, and are just mentioned by the way. The first three\r\nmay be considered as _high_, the four following as _medium_, and the\r\nlast _two_ as deep instruments. This may serve as a guide to their use\r\nwith percussion instruments of determinate sounds, playing in\r\ncorresponding registers.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of resonance in orchestral groups and combination of\r\ndifferent tone qualities.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the resonance of the respective groups of\r\nsound-sustaining instruments we arrive at the following approximate\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\nIn the most resonant group, the brass, the strongest instruments are\r\nthe trumpets, trombones and tuba. In loud passages the horns are only\r\none-half as strong, 1 Trumpet = 1 Trombone = 1 Tuba = 2 Horns.\r\nWood-wind instruments, in _forte_ passages, are twice as weak as the\r\nhorns, 1 Horn = 2 Clarinets = 2 Oboes = 2 Flutes = 2 Bassoons; but, in\r\n_piano_ passages, all wind-instruments, wood or brass are of fairly\r\nequal balance.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to establish a comparison in resonance between\r\nwood-wind and strings, as everything depends on the number of the\r\nlatter, but, in an orchestra of medium formation, it may be taken for\r\ngranted that in _piano_ passages, the whole of one department (_all_\r\n1st Violins or _all_ 2nd Violins etc.) is equivalent in strength\r\nto one wind instrument, (Violins I = 1 Flute etc.), and, in _forte_\r\npassages, to two wind instruments, (Violins I = 2 Flutes = 1 Oboe + 1\r\nClarinet, etc.).\r\n\r\nIt is still harder to form a comparison with instruments of little\r\nsustaining power, for too great a diversity in production and emission\r\nof sound exists. The combined force of groups of sustained resonance\r\neasily overpowers the strings played _pizz._ or _col legno_, the piano\r\nplayed softly, or the celesta. As regards the _glockenspiel_, bells,\r\nand xylophone, their emphatic tone will easily prevail over other\r\ngroups in combination. The same may be said of the kettle-drums with\r\ntheir ringing, resounding quality, and also of other subsidiary\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the timbre of one group on another is noticeable when\r\nthe groups are doubled; for instance, when the wood-wind timbre is\r\nclosely allied to the strings on the one hand, and to the brass on the\r\nother. Re-inforcing both, the wind _thickens_ the strings and\r\n_softens_ the brass. The strings do not blend so well with the brass,\r\nand when the two groups are placed side by side, each is heard too\r\ndistinctly. The combination of the three different timbres in unison\r\nproduces a rich, mellow and coherent tone.\r\n\r\nAll, or several wind instruments in combination will absorb one\r\ndepartment of added strings:\r\n\r\n     2 Fl.  +  2 Ob.   +  Vns I,\r\nor:  2 Ob.  +  2 Cl.   +  Violas,\r\nor:  2 Cl.  +  2 Fag.  +  \'Cellos.\r\n\r\nOne department of strings added to the wood-wind in unison produces a\r\nsweet coherent quality, the wood-wind timbre still predominating; but\r\nthe addition of one wind instrument to all or part of the strings in\r\nunison, only thickens the resonance of the latter, the wood-wind\r\ntimbre being lost in the process:\r\n\r\n     Vns I    +  Vns II     +  1 Ob.,\r\nor:  Violas   +  \'Cellos    +  1 Cl.\r\nor:  \'Cellos  +  D. basses  +  1 Fag.\r\n\r\nMuted strings do not combine so well with wood-wind, as the two tone\r\nqualities remain distinct and separate. Uniting plucked strings and\r\npercussion with instruments of sustained resonance results in the\r\nfollowing: wind instruments, wood and brass, strengthen and clarify\r\n_pizzicato_ strings, harp, kettle-drums and percussion generally, the\r\nlatter lending a touch of relief to the tone of the wood-wind. Uniting\r\nplucked strings and percussion with bowed instruments does not produce\r\nsuch a satisfactory blend, both qualities being heard independently.\r\nThe combination of plucked strings with percussion alone, is\r\nexcellent; the two blend perfectly, and the consequent increase in\r\nresonance yields an admirable effect.\r\n\r\nThe relationship which exists between string harmonics and the flute\r\nor piccolo constitutes a link between the two groups in the upper\r\nrange of the orchestra. Moreover, the timbre of the viola may be\r\nvaguely compared to the middle register of the bassoon and the lowest\r\ncompass of the clarinet; hence, in the medium orchestral range, a\r\npoint of contact is established between the quartet of strings and the\r\nwood-wind.\r\n\r\nThe bassoon and horn provide the connection between wood-wind and\r\nbrass, these two instruments being somewhat analogous in character\r\nwhen played _piano_ or _mezzo-forte_; the flute also, in its lowest\r\nregister, recalls the _pianissimo_ trumpet tone. Stopped and muted\r\nnotes in horns and trumpets are similar in quality to the oboe and\r\nEng. horn, and blend tolerably well with the latter instrument.\r\n\r\nConcluding this survey of orchestral groups I add a few remarks which\r\nseem to me of special importance.\r\n\r\nThe principal part in music is undertaken by three instrumental groups\r\nof sustained resonance, representing the three primary elements,\r\nmelody, harmony and rhythm. Instruments of little sustaining power,\r\nthough sometimes used independently, are chiefly employed for ornament\r\nand colour; instruments producing indeterminate sounds play no melodic\r\nor harmonic part, their functions being purely rhythmical.\r\n\r\nBy glancing at the order in which the six orchestral groups are\r\nplaced, strings, wood-wind, brass, plucked strings, percussion\r\nproducing definite, and those producing indefinite sounds, the reader\r\nwill be able to determine the part played by each in the art of\r\norchestration, from the secondary standpoint of colour and expression.\r\nAs regards expression, the strings come first, and the expressive\r\ncapacity of the other groups diminishes in the above order, colour\r\nbeing the only attribute of the last group of percussion instruments.\r\n\r\nThe same order obtains from the standpoint of general effect in\r\norchestration. We can listen to strings for an almost indefinite\r\nperiod of time without getting tired, so varied are their\r\ncharacteristics (_vide_ the number of string quartets, suites,\r\nserenades etc. written for strings alone). The addition of a single\r\ngroup of strings will add lustre to a passage for wind instruments. On\r\nthe other hand, the quality of wind instruments soon becomes\r\nwearisome; the same may be said of plucked strings, and also\r\npercussion of every kind which should only be employed at reasonable\r\nintervals in orchestral composition.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the constant use of compound timbres, in\r\npair\'s, in three\'s etc. eliminates characteristics of tone, and\r\nproduces a dull, neutral texture, whereas the employment of simple,\r\nelementary combinations gives infinitely greater scope for variety in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n7 (20) June 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nMELODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether it be long or short, a simple theme or a melodic phrase,\r\nmelody should always stand out in relief from the accompaniment. This\r\nmay be done by artificial or natural means; artificially, when the\r\nquestion of tone quality does not come into consideration, and the\r\nmelody is detached by means of strongly accentuated dynamic shades;\r\nnaturally, by selection and contrast of timbres, strengthening of\r\nresonance by doubling, tripling, etc., or crossing of parts\r\n(violoncellos above the violas and violins, clarinets or oboes above\r\nthe flutes, bassoons above the clarinets etc.).\r\n\r\nMelody planned in the upper parts stands out from the very fact of\r\nposition alone, and likewise, to a less degree when it is situated in\r\nthe low register. In the middle of the orchestral range it is not so\r\nprominent and the methods referred to above come into operation. They\r\nmay also be employed for two part melody (in thirds and sixths) and\r\nfor polyphonic writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelody in stringed instruments.\r\n\r\nInstances of the melodic use of stringed instruments are innumerable.\r\nThe reader will find many examples in the present treatise. With the\r\nexception of the double basses,--dull in tone and of little\r\nflexibility, chiefly employed in unison or in octaves with the\r\nvioloncellos,--each of the other stringed instruments, taken\r\nindependently, is qualified to assume full responsibility for the\r\nmelodic line.\r\n\r\n\r\na) Violins.\r\n\r\nMelody in the soprano-alto register and an extra-high compass usually\r\nfalls to the lot of the 1st Violins, sometimes to the 2nd\r\nViolins or to both in unison, a process which produces fuller\r\nresonance without impairing quality of tone.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[84]].[C]--_Pianissimo_ melody (Vns I) of a\r\ntroubled dramatic character. Harmonic accompaniment (Vns II and\r\nViolas _tremolando_--middle parts; the Violoncellos forming the bass).\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: The present volume is divided into two parts, text (pp.\r\n1-152) and musical examples (pp. 1-333). The first page of the second\r\npart lists the standard full-score editions of Rimsky-Korsakov\'s works\r\nthat are referred to throughout the book. These references to specific\r\npassages are always indicated by boxed numbers or boxed letters\r\ncorresponding to the ones marking the sub-divisions of the particular\r\nscore. On the other hand, references in the text to the 312 musical\r\nexamples in the second part of the book are always indicated as "No.\r\n1," "No. 2," etc. Thus, "_The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[84]]" indicates that the\r\nreader should look at section [[84]] of the score of _The Tsar\'s\r\nBride_ as published by Belaieff in Leipzig, the music of which is not\r\nreprinted here; whereas "No. 1. _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_ 2nd movement [[B]]"\r\nindicates that the reader should look at the first musical example in\r\nthe second part of the present book, which comes from the section\r\nmarked [[B]] in the second movement of the score of _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_ as\r\npublished by Belaieff.]\r\n\r\n_Antar_, before [[70]].--Descending melodic phrase, Vns I _con\r\nsordini piano_.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_ 2nd movement [[B]].

Choice resonance.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Violas.\r\n\r\nMelody in the alto-tenor register and a still higher compass is\r\nassigned to the violas. _Cantabile_ melodies however are not so\r\nfrequently written for violas as for violins and \'cellos, partly\r\nbecause the viola tone is slightly nasal in quality and better fitted\r\nfor short characteristic phrases, partly because the number of viola\r\nplayers in an orchestra is smaller. Melodies confided to the violas\r\nare generally doubled by other strings or by the wood-wind.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 4. _Pan Voyevoda_, duet in Act II [[145]].

Such melodies\r\nare usually laid out for the top string (_A_) which possesses a\r\nwonderfully rich "chest" quality.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Antar_ [[56]]. _Cantabile_ on the _A_ string.\r\n\r\n_Antar_ [[63]].

Melodic phrase with embellishments.\r\n\r\n\r\nd) Double basses.\r\n\r\nOwing to its register--_basso profondo_ + a still lower compass,--and\r\nits muffled resonance, the double bass is little capable of broad\r\n_cantabile_ phrases and only in unison or in octaves with the \'cellos.\r\nIn my own compositions there is no phrase of any importance given to\r\nthe double bass without the support of \'cellos or bassoons.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* No. 10. _Legend of Kitesh_ [[306]]. Double bass solo, doubled first\r\nby the double bassoon, later by the bassoon.

The large number of violins prevents the wood-wind\r\npredominating, and the tone quality remains that of the string\r\nquartet, enriched and amplified.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 12. _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, beginning of the third movement. _Cantabile_\r\nfor Vns I and II on the _D_ string, then on the _A_.\r\n\r\n_The May Night_, overture [[D]].

It has already been\r\nstated that the _E_ string diminishes in fulness of tone the higher\r\nit ascends from the limits of the soprano voice. Moreover, melodic\r\nfigures in the very high register of the violins become too isolated\r\nfrom the rest of the _ensemble_ unless doubled in octaves. Such\r\ndoubling secures expression, fulness of tone and firmness of timbre.\r\nThe reader will find numerous examples of violins in octaves; a few\r\nare added below, chiefly broad and expressive phrases.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 22. _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[166]]. _Cantabile, piano._\r\n\r\n_The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[206]]. _Cantabile, mezzo-piano_; the lower part\r\nis in unison with the soprano voice.\r\n\r\n_Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, 3rd movement [[J]]. _Cantabile_ in _G_ major;\r\n_dolce_ and _cantabile_ (the same as Ex. 12).\r\n\r\nNo. 23. _The Legend of Tsar Saltan_ [[227]].

Perhaps an unique example of its kind;\r\nviolins playing in the very extremity of the high register.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ This passage is difficult but nevertheless quite\r\n     playable. One or two desks of the 1st Violins are\r\n     sufficient to double the melody in the upper octave, all the\r\n     other 1st Violins can play the octave below. In this way\r\n     the piercing quality of the highest notes will be\r\n     diminished, the melody will acquire a clearer and more\r\n     pleasant sound, and the expressive tone quality of the lower\r\n     octave will be strengthened.\r\n\r\n* _The Golden Cockerel_ [[156]].\r\n\r\n*   "    "       "      [[165]].\r\n\r\n* _Antar_, 1st movement [[11]].\r\n\r\n* No. 25. _Ivan the Terrible_, Act III [[63]].\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Violins _divisi_ in octaves.\r\n\r\nFirst and second violins divided in two parts and progressing in\r\noctaves will deprive the melody of resonance, since the number of\r\nplayers is diminished by half, the consequences being specially\r\nnoticeable in small orchestras. Nevertheless the method can be used\r\noccasionally when the strings are doubled by the wood-wind, and when\r\nthe melody falls in a sufficiently high register.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[166]].--Vns I/Vns II] 8 _mezzo-forte\r\nespressivo_.

In\r\nwriting thirds doubled in octaves, the first and second violins should\r\nbe used. In spite of the difference in the quantity of players, the\r\nthirds will not sound unequal. The same arrangement may obtain in the\r\nviola and \'cello groups, but it is useless in the case of melody in\r\nsixths.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* No. 34. _Legend of Kitesh_ [[34]]--Vns I _div._) 3/Vns II\r\n_div._) 3] 8.\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Kitesh_ [[39]]--Vns I/Violas] 6.\r\n\r\nCf. also _Legend of Kitesh_ [[223]]: Vns I/Vns II} 3/Vns\r\nI/Vns II} 3] 8 (Ex. 31).\r\n\r\nDistribution in octaves, thirds, and sixths is usually regulated by\r\nthe normal register of the respective instruments, so as to avoid any\r\nsuggestion of mannerism resulting from the disturbance of balance. But\r\nsuch a departure from the recognised order may be permitted in special\r\ncases. For instance, in the following example of writing in sixths the\r\nupper part is allotted to the \'cellos, the lower part to the violins\r\non the _G_ string; this arrangement produces a quality of tone\r\ndistinctly original in character.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\nNo. 35. _Spanish Capriccio_ [[D]]--\'Cellos/Vns I + II] 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelody in the wood-wind.\r\n\r\n* The choice of instruments for characteristic and expressive melody\r\nis based on their distinctive qualities, discussed minutely in the\r\nforegoing chapter.

I\r\ndo not advise the student to make too free a use of this proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nCombination in unison.\r\n\r\nThe combination of two different wood-wind instruments in unison\r\nyields the following tone qualities:\r\n\r\na) _Flute + Oboe._ A quality fuller than that of the flute, sweeter\r\nthan that of the oboe. Played softly, the flute will predominate in\r\nthe low, the oboe in the upper register. Example: No. 52.\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[113]].\r\n\r\nb) _Flute + Clarinet._ A quality fuller than that of the flute, duller\r\nthan that of the clarinet. The flute will predominate in the lower,\r\nthe clarinet in the higher register. Examples: No. 53. _Legend of\r\nKitesh_ [[330]]; also [[339]] and [[342]].\r\n\r\nc) _Oboe + Clarinet._ A fuller quality than that of either instrument\r\nheard separately. The dark, nasal tone of the oboe will prevail in the\r\nlow register, the bright, "chest" quality of the clarinet in the high\r\ncompass. Examples: _Snegourotchka_ [[19]]; No. 54. _Snegourotchka_\r\n[[115]]. Cf. also _Legend of Kitesh_ [[68]], [[70]], [[84]]--2 Ob. + 3\r\nCl. (Ex. 199-201).\r\n\r\nd) _Flute + Oboe + Clarinet._ Very full in quality. The flute\r\npredominates in the low register, the oboe in the middle, and the\r\nclarinet in the high compass. Examples: _Mlada_, Act I [[1]]; *\r\n_Sadko_ [[58]] (2 Fl. + 2 Ob. + Small Cl.).\r\n\r\ne) _Bassoon + Clarinet._ Very full quality. The gloomy character of\r\nthe clarinet prevails in the lower register, the sickly quality of the\r\nbassoon in the higher. Example: _Mlada_, Act II, after [[49]].\r\n\r\nf) _Bassoon + Oboe_, and\r\n\r\ng) _Bassoon + Flute._\r\n\r\nThe combinations _f_ and _g_, as well as _Bassoon + Clarinet + Oboe_,\r\nand _Bassoon + Clarinet + Flute_ are very seldom found except in\r\ncertain orchestral _tutti_, where they produce increased resonance\r\nwithout creating a fresh atmosphere. But in such combinations, the\r\nrange of which is practically restricted to the limits of the third\r\noctave, the low notes of the flute will predominate in the lower third\r\nof this register, and the high notes of the bassoon in the middle\r\nthird. The clarinet, weak in the middle compass will not stand out\r\nprominently in this particular combination.\r\n\r\nh) _Bassoon + Clarinet + Oboe + Flute._ This combination is equally\r\nrare. The colour is rich, and difficult to define in words. The tone\r\nof each instrument will be separated from the others more or less in\r\nthe manner detailed above. Examples: _Russian Easter F\xc3\xaate_, the\r\nbeginning; No. 55. _Snegourotchka_ [[301]]; _The May Night_, Act III\r\n[[Qqq]].\r\n\r\nThe process of combining two or more qualities of tone in unison,\r\nwhile endowing the music with greater resonance, sweetness and power,\r\npossesses the disadvantage of restricting the variety of colour and\r\nexpression. Individual timbres lose their characteristics when\r\nassociated with others. Hence such combinations should be handled with\r\nextreme care. Phrases or melodies demanding diversity of expression\r\nalone should be entrusted to solo instruments of simple timbres. The\r\nsame applies to the coupling of two instruments of the same kind, such\r\nas 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons. The quality of tone\r\nwill lose nothing of its individuality, and will gain in power, but\r\nits capacity for expression will be diminished accordingly. An\r\ninstrument enjoys greater independence and freedom when used as a solo\r\nthan when it is doubled. The use of doubling and mixed timbres is\r\nnaturally more frequent in loud passages than in soft ones, also where\r\nexpression and colour is broad rather than individual or intimate in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n     I cannot refrain from mentioning how greatly I dislike the\r\n     method of duplicating all the wood-wind, in order to balance\r\n     a group of strings, reinforced out of all reason, to suit\r\n     the ever-growing dimensions of concert halls. I am convinced\r\n     that, artistically speaking, a limit should be set to the\r\n     size of both concert room and orchestra. The music performed\r\n     at these super-concerts must be specially composed on a plan\r\n     of its own--a subject which cannot be considered here.\r\n\r\n\r\nCombination in octaves.\r\n\r\nWhen the melody is entrusted to two wood-wind instruments in octaves,\r\nthe usual arrangement producing natural resonance is:\r\n\r\n8 [Fl. Fl. Fl. Ob. Ob. Cl.\r\n  [Ob. Cl. Fag. Cl. Fag. Fag.] 8.\r\n\r\nThe combination of flute and bassoon in octaves is rare on account of\r\nthe widely separated registers of the two instruments. Deviation from\r\nthe natural order, such as placing the bassoon above the clarinet or\r\noboe, the clarinet above the oboe or flute etc., creates an unnatural\r\nresonance occasioned by the confusion of registers, the instrument of\r\nlower compass playing in its high register and _vice versa_. The lack\r\nof proper relationship between the different tone qualities then\r\nbecomes apparent.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 56. _Spanish Capriccio_ [[O]]--Fl./Ob.] 8.\r\n\r\nNo. 57. _Snegourotchka_ [[254]]--Fl./Eng. horn] 8.\r\n\r\n* No. 58. _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, 3rd movement [[E]]--Fl./Cl.] 8.\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[195]]--Fl./Eng. horn] 8.\r\n\r\n_Pan Voyevoda_ [[132]]--Fl./Cl.] 8.\r\n\r\n_Tsar Saltan_ [[39]]--Cl./Fag.] 8.\r\n\r\nNo. 59. _Vera Scheloga_ [[30]]--Cl./Fag.] 8, likewise any number of\r\nexamples in the scores of various composers.\r\n\r\nThe use of two instruments of the same colour in octaves, e.g. 2\r\nflutes, 2 clarinets or 2 bassoons etc., if not exactly to be avoided\r\nis certainly not to be recommended, as the instruments, playing in\r\ndifferent registers will not correspond one with the other.\r\nNevertheless this method may be safely employed when stringed\r\ninstruments, _arco_ or _pizzicato_ double the two members of the\r\nwood-wind, and especially in the middle compass. The process is most\r\nsatisfactory for repeated notes or sustained passages.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_The May Night_, Act I [[T]]--Cl. I/Cl. II] 8.\r\n\r\n* _Sadko_, after [[159]]--Ob. I/Ob.

Thus\r\nthe piccolo will be doubled by the flute, oboe or clarinet an octave\r\nlower; the double bassoon will be doubled by bassoon, clarinet or bass\r\nclarinet an octave higher.\r\n\r\n8 [Picc.

Combination of wind and brass in unison.\r\n\r\nThe combination of a wood-wind and brass instrument produces a complex\r\nresonance in which the tone of the brass predominates. This resonance\r\nis naturally more powerful than that of each instrument taken\r\nseparately, but slightly sweeter than the brass instrument alone. The\r\ntone of the wood-wind blends with that of the brass, softens and\r\nrarefies it, as in the process of combining two wood-wind instruments\r\nof different colour. Instances of such doubling are fairly numerous,\r\nespecially in _forte_ passages. The trumpet is the instrument most\r\nfrequently doubled: Trumpet + Cl., Trumpet + Ob., Trumpet + Fl., as\r\nwell as Trumpet + Cl. + Ob. + Fl.; the horn, less often: Horn + Cl.,\r\nHorn + Fag. Trombones and Tuba may also be doubled: Trombone + Fag.,\r\nTuba + Fag. Combining the Eng. horn, bass clarinet and double bassoon\r\nwith the brass, in corresponding registers, presents the same\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Legend of Kitesh_ [[56]]--Trombone + Eng. horn.\r\n\r\n* _Mlada_, Act III, before [[34]]--3 Trombones + Bass cl.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the addition of a wind to a brass instrument yields a finer\r\nlegato effect than when the latter instrument plays alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Combination of wind and brass in octaves.\r\n\r\nDoubling the horns in octaves by clarinets, oboes or flutes often\r\nreplaces the combination\r\n\r\n1 Trumpet           ]\r\n1 Horn (or 2 Horns) ] 8.\r\n\r\nThis is done when it is a question of introducing a rich tone into the\r\nupper octave which the trumpet is not capable of imparting. If a\r\nsingle horn is used, the upper part is allotted to 2 clarinets, 2\r\noboes, or 2 flutes. But if there are two horns playing the lower\r\noctave in unison, three or four wind instruments will be necessary\r\nabove, especially in _forte_ passages:\r\n\r\n8 [2 Ob. or 2 Cl. or 2 Fl.\r\n  [1 Horn\r\n\r\nas well as\r\n\r\n1 Ob. + 1 Cl.]    2 Fl. + 2 Cl.]\r\n1 Horn       ] 8; 2 Horns      ] 8.\r\n\r\nTo double a trumpet in the upper octave three or four wind instruments\r\nare required, but in the top register two flutes will suffice.\r\n\r\n[Music] [Music]\r\n\r\nWood-wind instruments should not be used to double a trombone in the\r\noctave above; trumpets are more suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of doubling in octaves:\r\n\r\n* _Snegourotchka_ [[71]]--Ob. + Cl./Horn] 8.\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Tsar Saltan_, before [[180]]--Ob. + Cl./Ob. + Cl.]\r\n6/Horn/Horn] 6] 8.\r\n\r\n* Mention should also be made of mixed timbres (wood and brass) in\r\nprogression in octaves.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Mlada_, Act III, beginning of Scene III--Trombone + Bass cl./Tuba +\r\nC-fag.] 8.\r\n\r\nNo. 78. _Mlada_, Act III after [[25]]--2 Cl. + 2 Horns + Trombone/Bass\r\ncl. + 2 Horns + Trombone] 8 (low register).\r\n\r\nNo. 79. _Mlada_, Act III, before [[35]]--general unison.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to distribute the melody over three or four\r\noctaves, it is difficult to achieve perfect balance of tone.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, 4th movement, 15th bar after [[W]]--Picc./2 Fl.\r\n+ 2 Ob./2 Trumpets] 8/8.\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Tsar Saltan_ [[228]]--Picc./2 Fl. + 2 Ob./Trumpet + Eng.\r\nhorn] 8/8.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Combination of strings and wind.\r\n\r\nIn commencing this section of the work I consider it necessary to lay\r\ndown the following fundamental rules which apply equally to melody,\r\nharmony, counterpoint and polyphonic writing.\r\n\r\nAll combinations of strings and wood-wind are good; a wind instrument\r\nprogressing in unison with a stringed instrument increases the\r\nresonance of the latter and amplifies its tone, while the quality of\r\nthe strings softens that of the wood-wind. In such combinations the\r\nstrings will predominate provided that the two instruments are of\r\nequal power, e.g. when violins are coupled with an oboe, a bassoon\r\nwith the \'cellos. If several wind instruments play in unison with one\r\ngroup of strings, the latter will be overpowered. As a rule all\r\ncombinations refine the characteristics of each instrument taken\r\nseparately, the wood-wind losing more than the strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Doubling in unison._\r\n\r\nThe best and most natural combinations are between instruments whose\r\nregisters correspond the nearest:\r\n\r\nVns + Fl.

Combination of strings and brass.\r\n\r\nOwing to the dissimilarity between the quality of string and brass\r\ntone, the combination of these two groups in unison can never yield\r\nsuch a perfect blend as that produced by the union of strings and\r\nwood-wind. When a brass and a stringed instrument progress in unison,\r\neach can be heard separately, but the instruments in each group which\r\ncan be combined with the greatest amount of success are those whose\r\nrespective registers correspond the most nearly; Violin + Trumpet;\r\nViola + Horn; \'Cellos/D. basses + Trombones/Tuba (for heavy massive\r\neffects).\r\n\r\nThe combination of horns and \'cellos, frequently employed, produces a\r\nbeautifully blended, soft quality of tone.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Tsar Saltan_ [[29]]--Vns I + II + Horn.\r\n\r\n* No. 92. _The Golden Cockerel_ [[98]]--Violas _con sord._ + Horn.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.

Moreover,\r\ntransparence, accuracy and purity in the movement of each part are\r\nessential conditions if satisfactory resonance is to be obtained. No\r\nperfection in resonance can accrue from faulty progression of parts.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ There are people who consider orchestration simply\r\n     as the art of selecting instruments and tone qualities,\r\n     believing that if an orchestral score does not sound well,\r\n     it is entirely due to the choice of instruments and timbres.\r\n     But unsatisfactory resonance is often solely the outcome of\r\n     faulty handling of parts, and such a composition will\r\n     continue to sound badly whatever choice of instruments is\r\n     made. So, on the other hand, it often happens that a passage\r\n     in which the chords are properly distributed, and the\r\n     progression of parts correctly handled, will sound equally\r\n     well if played by strings, wood-wind or brass.\r\n\r\nThe composer should picture to himself the exact harmonic formation of\r\nthe piece he intends to orchestrate. If, in his rough sketch, there\r\nexist any uncertainly as to the number or movement of harmonic parts,\r\nhe is advised to settle this at once. It is likewise essential for him\r\nto form a clear idea as to the construction and musical elements of\r\nthe piece, and to realise the exact nature and limitations of the\r\nthemes, phrases and ideas he is going to employ. Every transition from\r\none order of harmonic writing to another, from four-part harmony to\r\nthree, or from five-part harmony to unison etc., must coincide with\r\nthe introduction of a new idea, a fresh theme or phrase; otherwise the\r\norchestrator will encounter many unforeseen and insurmountable\r\ndifficulties. For example, if, during a passage written in four parts\r\na chord in five-part harmony is introduced, a fresh instrument must\r\nneeds be added to play this particular fifth part, and this addition\r\nmay easily damage the resonance of the chord in question, and render\r\nthe resolution of a discord or the correct progression of parts\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of harmonic parts--Duplication.\r\n\r\nIn the very large majority of cases harmony is written in four parts;\r\nthis applies not only to single chords or a succession of them, but\r\nalso to the formation of the harmonic basis. Harmony which at first\r\nsight appears to comprise 5, 6, 7 and 8 parts, is usually only four\r\npart harmony with extra parts added. These additions are nothing more\r\nthan the duplication in the adjacent upper octave of one or more of\r\nthe three upper parts forming the original harmony, the bass being\r\ndoubled in the lower octave only. The following diagrams will explain\r\nmy meaning:\r\n\r\n[Music: _A. Close part-writing._\r\n\r\nFour part harmony.\r\nDuplication of 1 part.\r\nDuplication of 2 parts.\r\nDuplication of 3 parts.]\r\n\r\n[Music: _B. Widely-divided part-writing._\r\n\r\nFour part harmony.\r\nDuplication of 1 part.\r\nDuplication of 2 parts.]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In widely-spaced harmony only the soprano and alto\r\n     parts may be doubled in octaves. Duplicating the tenor part\r\n     is to be avoided, as close writing is thereby produced, and\r\n     doubling the bass part creates an effect of heaviness. The\r\n     bass part should never mix with the others:\r\n\r\n     Bad: [Music]\r\n\r\nOn account of the distance between the bass and the three other parts,\r\nonly partial duplication is possible.\r\n\r\nGood: [Music]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ Notes in unison resulting from correct duplication\r\n     need not be avoided, for although the tone in such cases is\r\n     not absolutely uniform, the ear will be satisfied with the\r\n     correct progression of parts.\r\n\r\nConsecutive octaves between the upper parts are not permissible:\r\n\r\nBad: [Music]\r\n\r\nConsecutive fifths resulting from the duplication of the three upper\r\nparts moving in chords of sixths are of no importance:\r\n\r\nGood: [Music]\r\n\r\nThe bass of an inversion of the dominant chord should never be doubled\r\nin any of the upper parts:\r\n\r\nGood: [Music] Bad: [Music]\r\n\r\nThis applies also to other chords of the seventh and diminished\r\nseventh:\r\n\r\nBad: [Music] Good: [Music]\r\n\r\nThe rules of harmony concerning sustained and pedal passages apply\r\nwith equal force to orchestral writing. As regards passing and\r\nauxiliary notes, _\xc3\xa9chapp\xc3\xa9es_, considerable licence is permitted in\r\nrapid passages of different texture:\r\n\r\nOne texture: [Music]\r\n\r\nA different one: [Music]\r\n\r\nOne texture: [Music]\r\n\r\nA different one: [Music]\r\n\r\nA certain figure and its essentials, in simplified form, may proceed\r\nconcurrently, as in the following example:\r\n\r\nOne texture: [Music]\r\n\r\nA different one: [Music]\r\n\r\nA third: [Music]\r\n\r\nUpper and inner pedal notes are more effective on the orchestra than\r\nin pianoforte or chamber music, owing to the greater variety of tone\r\ncolour:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nIn Vol. II of the present work many examples of the above methods will\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution of notes in chords.\r\n\r\nThe normal order of sounds or the natural harmonic scale:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nmay serve as a guide to the orchestral arrangement of chords. It will\r\nbe seen that the widely-spaced intervals lie in the lower part of the\r\nscale, gradually becoming closer as the upper register is approached:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe bass should rarely lie at a greater distance than an octave from\r\nthe part directly above it (tenor harmony). It is necessary to make\r\nsure that the harmonic notes are not lacking in the upper parts:\r\n\r\nTo be avoided: [Music]\r\n\r\nThe use of sixths in the upper parts, and the practice of doubling the\r\nupper note in octaves are sometimes effective methods:\r\n\r\n[Music] [Music]\r\n\r\nWhen correct progression increases the distance between the top and\r\nbottom notes of the upper parts, this does not matter:\r\n\r\nGood: [Music]\r\n\r\nBut it would be distinctly bad to fill in the second chord thus:\r\n\r\nNot good: [Music]\r\n\r\nHence it follows that the distribution of intermediate parts is a\r\nquestion of the greatest importance. Nothing is worse than writing\r\nchords, the upper and lower parts of which are separated by wide,\r\nempty intervals, especially in _forte_ passages; in _piano_ passages\r\nsuch distribution may be possible. Progression in contrary motion, the\r\nupper and lower parts diverging by degrees gives rise to the gradual\r\naddition of extra parts occupying the middle register:\r\n\r\nSchematic Example: [Music]\r\n\r\nWhen the voices converge, the middle parts are eliminated one by one:\r\n\r\nSchematic Example: [Music]\r\n\r\n\r\nString harmony.\r\n\r\nIt is an incontrovertible rule that the resonance of different\r\nharmonic parts must be equally balanced, but this balance will be less\r\nnoticeable in short sharp chords than in those which are connected and\r\nsustained. Both these cases will be studied separately. In the first\r\ncase, in order to increase the number of harmonic parts, each\r\ninstrument in the string group may be provided with double notes or\r\nchords of three and four notes. In the second case, the resources are\r\nlimited to double notes _unis_, or division of parts.\r\n\r\nA. _Short chords._ Chords of three or four notes can only be executed\r\nrapidly on the strings.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ It is true that the two upper notes of a chord can\r\n     be sustained and held a long time; this, however, involves\r\n     complications and will be considered later.\r\n\r\nShort chords, _arco_, only sound well when played _forte_ (_sf_), and\r\nwhen they can be supported by wind instruments. In the execution of\r\ndouble notes and chords of three and four notes on the strings,\r\nbalance, perfect distribution of tone, and correct progression of\r\nparts are of minor importance. What must be considered before\r\neverything is the resonance of the chords themselves, and the degree\r\nof ease with which they can be played. Those comprising notes on the\r\ngut strings are the most powerful. Chords played on several strings\r\nare usually assigned to 1st and 2nd violins and violas, the\r\ndifferent notes being divided between them according to ease in\r\nexecution and the demands of resonance. On account of its low register\r\nthe \'cello is rarely called upon to play chords on three or four\r\nstrings, and is usually allotted the lowest note of the chord in\r\ncompany with the double bass. Chords on the latter instrument are even\r\nmore uncommon, but it may supply the octave on an uncovered string.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 97. _Snegourotchka_ [[171]]; cf. also before [[140]] and before\r\n[[200]].\r\n\r\n* _Spanish Capriccio_, before [[V]] (cf.

Taking for granted that\r\nthe different members of the string group are equal in power, the\r\nparts being written according to the usual order of register, (cf.\r\nChap. I), it is patent that a passage in close four-part harmony, with\r\nthe bass in octaves will also be uniformly resonant. When it is\r\nnecessary to introduce notes to fill up the empty middle register, the\r\nupper parts being farther distant from the bass, doubled notes on the\r\nviolins or violas should be used, or on both instruments together. The\r\nmethod of dividing strings, which is sometimes adopted, should be\r\navoided in such cases, as certain parts of the chord will be divided\r\nand others will not; but, on the other hand, if a passage in six and\r\nseven-part harmony be written entirely for strings divided in the same\r\nmanner, the balance of tone will be completely satisfactory, e.g.,\r\n\r\ndiv. { Vns I/Vns I\r\ndiv. { Vns II/Vns II\r\ndiv. { Violas I/Violas II\r\n\r\nIf the harmony in the three upper parts, thus strengthened, is written\r\nfor divided strings, the \'cellos and basses, playing _non divisi_ will\r\nprove a trifle heavy; their tone must therefore be eased, either by\r\nmarking the parts down or reducing the number of players.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sustained chords or _forte tremolando_ on two strings,\r\nthe progression of parts is not always according to rule, the\r\nintervals chosen being those which are the easiest to play.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 100. _The Christmas Night_ [[161]]--Full _divisi_.\r\n\r\nNo. 101.

This may be obtained by the following means:\r\n\r\n1. Instruments forming chords must be used continuously in the same\r\nway during a given passage, that is to say they must be doubled or not\r\nthroughout, except when one of the harmonic parts is to be made\r\nprominent:\r\n\r\nTo be avoided: [Music]\r\n\r\n2. The normal order of register must be followed, except in the case\r\nof crossing or enclosure of parts, which will be discussed later on:\r\n\r\nTo be avoided: [Music]\r\n\r\n3. Corresponding or adjacent registers should be made to coincide\r\nexcept for certain colour effects:\r\n\r\nTo be avoided: [Music]\r\n\r\nThe second flute will sound too weak and the oboes too piercing.\r\n\r\n4. Concords (octaves, thirds and sixths) and not discords (fifths,\r\nfourths, seconds and sevenths), should be given to instruments of the\r\nsame kind or colour, except when discords are to be emphasised. This\r\nrule should be specially observed in writing for the oboe with its\r\npenetrating quality of tone:\r\n\r\nTo be avoided: [Music]\r\n\r\n\r\nFour-part and three-part harmony.\r\n\r\nHarmonic writing for the wood-wind may be considered from two points\r\nof view: a) instruments in pairs, 2 Fl., 2 Ob., 2 Cl., 2 Fag.; and b)\r\ninstruments in three\'s, 3 Fl., 2 Ob., Eng. horn, 3 Cl., 2 Fag., C-fag.\r\n\r\nA. _In pairs._ There are three ways of distribution: 1.\r\n_Superposition_ or _overlaying_ (strictly following the normal order\r\nof register), 2. _Crossing_, and 3. _Enclosure_ of parts. The last\r\ntwo methods involve a certain disturbance of the natural order of\r\nregister:\r\n\r\n[Music: Overlaying. Crossing. Enclosure.]\r\n\r\nIn choosing one of these three methods the following points must not\r\nbe forgotten: a) the register of a particular isolated chord; the soft\r\nand weak register of an instrument should not be coupled with the\r\npowerful and piercing range of another:\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\nOverlaying.\r\nOboe too\r\npiercing.\r\n\r\nCrossing.\r\nLow notes\r\nof the flute\r\ntoo weak.\r\n\r\nEnclosure.\r\nBassoon too\r\nprominent.]\r\n\r\n\r\nb) In a succession of chords the general progression of parts must be\r\nconsidered; one tone quality should be devoted to the stationary and\r\nanother to the moving parts:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nWhen chords are in widely-divided four-part harmony notes may be\r\nallotted in pairs to two different tone qualities, adhering to the\r\nnormal order of register:\r\n\r\nGood: [Music] etc.\r\n\r\nAny other distribution will result unquestionably in a grievous lack\r\nof relationship between registers:\r\n\r\nTo be avoided: [Music] etc.\r\n\r\nIf one tone quality is to be enclosed, it must be between two\r\ndifferent timbres:\r\n\r\nGood: [Music] etc.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to lend four distinct timbres to a chord in\r\nwidely-divided four-part harmony, though such a chord will possess no\r\nuniformity in colour; but the higher the registers of the different\r\ninstruments are placed, the less perceptible becomes the space which\r\nseparates them:\r\n\r\n[Music: Fairly good Better Still better]\r\n\r\nThe use of four different timbres in close four-part harmony is to be\r\navoided, as the respective registers will not correspond:\r\n\r\n[Music: Bad Better Still slightly better]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In _Mozart and Salieri_, which is only scored for 1\r\n     Fl., 1 Ob., 1 Cl. and 1 Fag., wood-wind chords in four-part\r\n     harmony are of necessity devoted to these four different\r\n     timbres.\r\n\r\nThe same rules apply to writing in three-part harmony, which is the\r\nmost customary form when it is a question of establishing a harmonic\r\nbasis, the lowest register of which is entrusted to another group of\r\ninstruments (strings _arco_ or _pizz._, for example). Chords in\r\nthree-part harmony are generally given to two instruments of one\r\ntimbre and a third instrument of another, but never to three different\r\ntimbres. Overlaying of parts is the best course to adopt:\r\n\r\n[Music] etc.\r\n\r\nThe use of crossing and enclosure of parts (which in a way amount to\r\nthe same thing) must depend on the manner of their progression:\r\n\r\n[Music: Enclosure]\r\n\r\nB. _Wood-wind in three\'s._ Here the distribution of chords in close\r\nthree-part harmony is self-evident; any grouping of three instruments\r\nof the same timbre is sure to sound well:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nalso: [Music]\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nOverlaying of parts is the best method to follow in writing close\r\nfour-part harmony; three instruments of the same timbre with a fourth\r\ninstrument of another. Crossing and enclosure of parts may also be\r\nemployed. Correspondence of timbres and the progression of remote\r\nparts must be kept in mind:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe method of using three instruments of the same timbre in\r\nwidely-divided three-part harmony is inferior:\r\n\r\n[Music: Not good Better Better Not good Better Better]\r\n\r\nBut if the third instrument is of low register (Bass Fl., Eng. horn,\r\nBass cl., or C-fag.), the resonance will be satisfactory:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nIn chords of four-part harmony, three instruments of the same timbre\r\nshould be combined with a fourth instrument of another:\r\n\r\n[Music] etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarmony in several parts.\r\n\r\nIn writing chords of 5, 6, 7 and 8 part-harmony, whether they are\r\nindependent, or constitute the harmonic basis, the student should\r\nfollow the principles outlined in the previous chapter, dealing with\r\nthe progression of wood-wind instruments in octaves. As the 5th,\r\n6th, 7th and 8th notes are only duplications in octaves of\r\nlower notes of the real harmony (in 4 parts), instruments should be\r\nchosen which combine amongst themselves to give the best octaves. The\r\nprocess of crossing and enclosure of parts may also be used.\r\n\r\nA. Wood-wind in pairs (close distribution):\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nIn widely-divided harmony chords in several parts are to be avoided as\r\nthey will entail both close and extended writing:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In the majority of cases this distribution is\r\n     employed when the two upper harmonic parts have a special\r\n     melodic duty to perform--this question is discussed above.\r\n\r\nB. Wood-wind in three\'s:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n[Music] etc.\r\n\r\nOverlaying of parts is the most satisfactory method in dealing with\r\nclose three-part harmony. Crossing of parts is not so favourable, as\r\noctaves will be produced contrary to the natural order of register:\r\n\r\n[Music] Here the arrangement [Music] is bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuplication of timbres.\r\n\r\nA. If the wood-wind is in pairs it is a good plan to mix the doubled\r\ntimbres as much as possible:\r\n\r\n[Music: Excellent],\r\n\r\nalso: [Music]\r\n\r\nIn chords of four-part harmony the classical method may be adopted:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nIn this case, though the high _C_ in the flute is fairly powerful, the\r\nresonance of the _G_ and _E_ in the oboes is softened by the\r\nduplication of the 2nd flute and 1st clarinet, while the _C_ in\r\nthe 2nd clarinets (not doubled) is feeble in comparison with the\r\nother notes. In any case the two extreme parts are the thinnest and\r\nweakest in tone, the intermediate parts the fullest and strongest.\r\n\r\nB. _Wood-wind in three\'s_ admit of perfectly balanced mixed timbres in\r\nchords of three-part harmony:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThese timbres may even originate from three-fold duplication:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarks.\r\n\r\n1. Modern orchestrators do not allow any void in the intermediate\r\nparts in writing close harmony; it was permitted to some extent by the\r\nclassics:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThese empty spaces create a bad effect especially in _forte_ passages.\r\nFor this reason widely-divided harmony, which is fundamentally based\r\non the extension of intervals, can be used but seldom and only in\r\n_piano_ passages. Close writing is the more frequent form in all\r\nharmony devoted to the wood-wind, _forte_ or _piano_.\r\n\r\n2. As a general rule a chord of greatly extended range and in several\r\nparts is distributed according to the order of the natural scale, with\r\nwide intervals (octaves and sixths), in the bass part, lesser\r\nintervals (fifths and fourths) in the middle, and close intervals\r\n(3rds or 2nds) in the upper register:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n3. In many cases correct progression of parts demands that one of them\r\nshould be temporarily doubled. In such cases the ear is reconciled to\r\nthe brief overthrow of balance for the sake of a single part, and is\r\nthankful for the logical accuracy of the progression. The following\r\nexample will illustrate my meaning:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nIn the second bar of this example the _D_ is doubled in unison on\r\naccount of the proximity of the three upper parts to their\r\ncorresponding parts an octave lower. In the fourth bar the _F_ is\r\ndoubled in unison in both groups.\r\n\r\n4. The formation of the harmonic basis, which is essentially in four\r\nparts, does not by any means devolve upon the wood-wind alone. One of\r\nthe parts is often devoted to the strings, _arco_ or _pizz._ More\r\nfrequently the bass part is treated separately, the chords of greater\r\nvalue in the three upper parts being allotted to the wood-wind. Then,\r\nif the upper part is assigned to a group of strings, there remains\r\nnothing for the wind except the sustained harmony in the two middle\r\nparts. In the first case the three-part harmony in the wood-wind\r\nshould form an independent whole, receiving no assistance from the\r\nbass; in this manner intervals of open fourths and fifths will be\r\nobviated. In the second case it is desirable to provide the\r\nintermediate parts with a moderately full tone, choosing no other\r\nintervals except seconds, sevenths, thirds or sixths.\r\n\r\nAll that has been said with regard to the use of wood-wind in the\r\nformation of harmony, and the division of simple and mixed timbres\r\napplies with equal force to sustained chords, or harmonic progressions\r\ninterchanging rapidly with _staccato_ chords. In short chords,\r\nseparated by rests of some importance, the arrangement and division of\r\ntimbres is not so perceptible to the ear, and progression of parts\r\nattracts less attention. It would be useless, nay, impossible to\r\nexamine the countless combinations of tone colour, all the varieties\r\nof duplication and distribution of chords. It has been my aim to\r\ndenote the fundamental principles upon which to work, and to indicate\r\nthe general rules to be followed. Once having mastered these, if the\r\nstudent devote a little time to the study of full scores, and listen\r\nto them on the orchestra, he will soon learn when certain methods\r\nshould be used and when to adopt others. The pupil is advised,\r\ngenerally, to write for wood-wind in its normal order of distribution,\r\nto take heed that each particular chord is composed entirely either of\r\nduplicated or non-duplicated parts, (except in certain cases resulting\r\nfrom progression), to use the methods of crossing and enclosure of\r\ntimbres with full knowledge of what he is doing, and finally to\r\nconcentrate his attention on close part-writing.\r\n\r\n_Examples of wood-wind harmony:_\r\n\r\na) Independent chords.\r\n\r\nNo. 105. _The Christmas Night_ [[148]]--Cl., 2 Fag.\r\n\r\nNo. 106.

The quartet of\r\ntrombones and tuba is not often employed in close four-part harmony;\r\nthe third trombone and the tuba usually form the bass in octaves, and\r\nthe three upper parts are generally allotted to the two remaining\r\ntrombones reinforced by a trumpet or two horns in unison, so as to\r\nobtain a perfect balance of tone:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nI have often adopted the following combination of brass instruments,\r\nand consider it eminently satisfactory: 2 horns and tuba to form the\r\nbass in octaves, the three other parts given to the trombones:\r\n\r\n[Music] (beautiful full resonance).\r\n\r\nIn the higher registers, four-part harmony, of which the two upper\r\nparts are given to the trumpets, may be completed by two trombones or\r\nfour horns in pairs:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nWhen 3 trumpets are available the fourth part should be allotted to\r\none trombone, or two horns in unison:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nEnclosure of parts may be used in single chords:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nor in progression:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThree-part writing.\r\n\r\nThe best combination is trombones, horns, or trumpets in three\'s. If\r\nthe instruments are mixed the number of horns should be doubled:\r\n\r\n[Music] etc.\r\n\r\nWriting in several parts.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole group is used the number of horns should be doubled:\r\n\r\n[Music] etc.\r\n\r\nIn seven, six, or five-part harmony certain instruments must be\r\nomitted:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n[Music] etc.\r\n\r\nDiscords of the seventh or second are preferably entrusted to\r\ninstruments of different tone colour:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nWhen such chords are written for an orchestra which only includes two\r\ntrumpets, it is impossible for the horns to proceed in pairs. In such\r\ncases the following arrangement may obtain, the horns being marked one\r\ndegree louder than the other instruments, to secure balance of tone:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe same method should be followed whenever the use of horns in pairs\r\nfails to produce satisfactory tone.\r\n\r\nWhen chords of widely-divided harmony are distributed throughout\r\nseveral harmonic registers, the register occupied by the horns need\r\nnot be doubled; the arrangement of the chord will resemble that of a\r\nchorale written for double or triple choir. For example:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nDuplication in the brass.\r\n\r\nDuplication in the brass group is most frequently effected by placing\r\na chord for horns side by side with the same chord written for\r\ntrumpets or trombones. The soft round quality of the horns intensifies\r\nthe tone, and moderates the penetrating timbre of the trumpets and\r\ntrombones:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nSimilar juxtaposition of trumpets and trombones:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nis not so common, as this unites the two most powerful agents in the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nIn handling an orchestra the brass is frequently employed to sustain\r\nnotes in two or three octaves; this sphere of activity must not be\r\nignored. The _tenuto_ is generally given to two trumpets, or to two or\r\nfour horns in the octave, (in double octaves). The octave is sometimes\r\nformed by trumpets and horns acting together:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe trombone with its ponderous tone rarely takes part in such\r\ncombinations. Sustained notes in double octaves are usually\r\napportioned thus:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe imperfect balance arising from the duplication of the middle note\r\nis compensated for by the mixture of timbres, which lends some unity\r\nto the chord.\r\n\r\n_Examples of harmony in the brass:_\r\n\r\na) Independent chords:\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[74]]--3 Trombones, 2 Horns.\r\n\r\n       "        [[140]]--3 Trombones, 2 Horns.

Four-part harmony given to two bassoons and two horns,\r\nespecially in soft passages, yields a finely-balanced tone recalling\r\nthe effect of a quartet of horns, but possessing slightly greater\r\ntransparence. In _forte_ passages the horns overwhelm the bassoons,\r\nand it is wiser to employ four horns alone. In the former case\r\ncrossing of parts is to be recommended for the purposes of blend, the\r\nconcords being given to the horns, the discords to the bassoons:\r\n\r\n[Music] and not: [Music]\r\n\r\nBassoons may also be written inside the horns, but the inverse process\r\nis not to be recommended:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nThe same insetting of parts may be used for sustained trumpet notes in\r\noctaves. In soft passages, thirds played in the low register of the\r\nflutes, sometimes combined with clarinets, produce a beautiful\r\nmysterious effect between trumpets in octaves. In a chain of\r\nconsecutive chords it is advisable to entrust the stationary parts to\r\nthe brass, the moving parts to the wood-wind.\r\n\r\nClarinets, on account of their tone quality should rarely be set\r\ninside the horns, but, in the upper register, and in the higher\r\nharmonic parts, a chord of four horns, (_piano_), may be completed by\r\nclarinets as effectively as by oboes or flutes; the bassoon may then\r\ndouble the base an octave below:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nPlayed _forte_, the horns are more powerful than the wood-wind;\r\nbalance may be established by doubling the upper harmonic parts:\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\na) Superposition.\r\n\r\n* _Sadko_, Symphonic Tableau [[1]], [[9]]--Fl., Ob., Cl., Horn (basis).\r\n\r\n     "     before [[14]]--2 Fl., Cl., Horns.\r\n\r\n     "     final chord--Fl., Cl., Horn.\r\n\r\n* _Antar_ [[22]]--Fl., Cl., Horns (basis).\r\n\r\nNo. 152. _Antar_ [[56]]--3 Fl., 4 Horns (basis).\r\n\r\n* _Snegourotchka_ [[300]]--Full wind and horns.\r\n\r\n* _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_--Final chords of 1st and 4th movements.\r\n\r\n* _Russian Easter F\xc3\xaate_ [[D]]--Fl., Cl., Horn; later trumpets and\r\ntrombones in juxtaposition (cf.

For instance, in a succession\r\nof chords where the melodic position is constantly changing,\r\ndistribution is subordinate to correct progression of parts. In\r\npractice, however, any inequality of tone may be counterbalanced by\r\nthe following acoustic phenomenon: in every chord the parts in octaves\r\nstrengthen one another, the harmonic sounds in the lowest register\r\ncoinciding with and supporting those in the highest. In spite of this\r\nfact it rests entirely with the orchestrator to obtain the best\r\npossible balance of tone; in difficult cases this may be secured by\r\njudicious dynamic grading, marking the wood-wind one degree louder\r\nthan the brass.\r\n\r\nB. Combination of strings and wind.\r\n\r\n1. We frequently meet with the combination of strings and wood-wind in\r\nthe light of comparison of one timbre with another, either in long\r\nsustained notes, or _tremolando_ in the strings. Apart from the\r\ncomplete or partial doubling of the string quartet (two methods\r\nfrequently used), the general and most natural arrangement is:\r\n\r\nFl./Ob. (Cl.) + Vns div.; Clar./Fag. + \'Cellos + Violas div., etc.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* _Sadko_, Symphonic Tableau before [[4]], and [[4]], 9th bar.\r\n\r\n* _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, 1st movement [[M]] 6 Vns soli + 2 Ob.

I have given a few examples of\r\nwell-sounding chords; for further information I advise the reader to\r\nstudy full scores with care, as this is the only method to acquire\r\nperfect knowledge of the distribution and doubling of various\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF THE ORCHESTRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent ways of orchestrating the same music.\r\n\r\nThere are times when the general tone, character and atmosphere of a\r\npassage, or a given moment in an orchestral work point to one, and\r\nonly one particular manner of scoring. The following simple example\r\nwill serve for explanation. Take a short phrase where a flourish or\r\nfanfare call is given out above a _tremolando_ accompaniment, with or\r\nwithout change in harmony. There is no doubt that any orchestrator\r\nwould assign the _tremolo_ to the strings and the fanfare to a\r\ntrumpet, never _vice versa_. But taking this for granted, the composer\r\nor orchestrator may still be left in doubt. Is the fanfare flourish\r\nsuitable to the range of a trumpet? Should it be written for two or\r\nthree trumpets in unison, or doubled by other instruments? Can any of\r\nthese methods be employed without damaging the musical meaning? These\r\nare questions which I shall endeavour to answer.\r\n\r\nIf the phrase is too low in register for the trumpets it should be\r\ngiven to the horns (instruments allied to the trumpet); if the phrase\r\nis too high it may be entrusted to the oboes and clarinets in unison,\r\nthis combination possessing the closest resemblance to the trumpet\r\ntone both in character and power. The question whether one trumpet or\r\ntwo should be employed must be decided by the degree of power to be\r\nvested in the given passage. If a big sonorous effect is required the\r\ninstruments may be doubled, tripled, or even multiplied by four; in\r\nthe opposite case one solo brass instrument, or two of the wood-wind\r\nwill suffice (1 Ob. + 1 Cl.). The question whether the _tremolo_ in\r\nthe strings should be supported by sustained harmony in the wood-wind\r\ndepends upon the purpose in view. A composer realises his intentions\r\nbeforehand, others who orchestrate his music can only proceed by\r\nconjecture. Should the composer desire to establish a strongly-marked\r\ndifference between the harmonic basis and the melodic outline it is\r\nbetter not to employ wood-wind harmony, but to obtain proper balance\r\nof tone by carefully distributing his dynamic marks of expression,\r\n_pp_, _p_, _f_ and _ff_. If, on the contrary, the composer desires a\r\nfull round tone as harmonic basis and less show of brilliance in the\r\nharmonic parts, the use of harmony in the wood-wind is to be\r\nrecommended. The following may serve as a guide to the scoring of\r\nwood-wind chords: the harmonic basis should differ from the melody not\r\nonly in fullness and intensity of tone, but also in colour. If the\r\nfanfare figure is allotted to the brass (trumpets or horns) the\r\nharmony should be given to the wood-wind; if the phrase is given to\r\nthe wood-wind (oboes and clarinets) the harmony should be entrusted to\r\nthe horns. To solve all these questions successfully a composer must\r\nhave full knowledge of the purpose he has in view, and those who\r\norchestrate his work should be permeated with his intentions. Here the\r\nquestion arises, what should those intentions be? This is a more\r\ndifficult subject.\r\n\r\nThe aim of a composer is closely allied to the form of his work, to\r\nthe aesthetic meaning of its every moment and phrase considered apart,\r\nand in relation to the composition as a whole. The choice of an\r\norchestral scheme depends on the musical matter, the colouring of\r\npreceding and subsequent passages. It is important to determine\r\nwhether a given passage is a complement to or a contrast with what\r\ngoes before and comes after, whether it forms a climax or merely a\r\nstep in the general march of musical thought. It would be impossible\r\nto examine all such possible types of relationship, or to consider the\r\n_r\xc3\xb4le_ played by each passage quoted in the present work. The reader\r\nis therefore advised not to pay too much attention to the examples\r\ngiven, but to study them and their bearing on the context in their\r\nproper place in the full scores. Nevertheless I shall touch upon a few\r\nof these points in the course of the following outline. To begin with,\r\nyoung and inexperienced composers do not always possess a clear idea\r\nof what they wish to do. They can improve in this direction by\r\nreading good scores and by repeatedly listening to an orchestra,\r\nprovided they concentrate the mind to the fullest possible extent. The\r\nsearch after extravagant and daring effects in orchestration is quite\r\na different thing from mere caprice; _the will to achieve is not\r\nsufficient; there are certain things which should not be achieved_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe simplest musical ideas, melodic phrases in unison and octaves, or\r\nrepeated throughout several octaves, chords, of which no single part\r\nhas any melodic meaning are scored in various ways according to\r\nregister, dynamic effect and the quality of expression or tone colour\r\nthat may be desired. In many cases, one idea will be orchestrated in a\r\ndifferent way every time it recurs. Later on I shall frequently touch\r\nupon this more complicated question.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* _Snegourotchka_ [[58]]; [[65]] and before [[68]]--sustained note in\r\nunison.\r\n\r\nThere are fewer possible ways of scoring more complex musical ideas,\r\nharmonico-melodic phrases, polyphonic designs etc.; sometimes there\r\nare but two methods to be followed, for each of the primary elements\r\nin music, melody, harmony, and counterpoint possesses its own special\r\nrequirements, regulating the choice of instruments and tone colour.\r\nThe most complicated musical ideas sometimes admit of only one manner\r\nof scoring, with a few hardly noticeable variations in detail. To the\r\nfollowing example, very simple in structure I add an alternative\r\nmethod of scoring:\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\nNo. 175. _Vera Scheloga_, before [[35]]--a) actual orchestration,\r\n*b)--another method.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the method b) will produce satisfactory tone. But a\r\n3rd and 4th way of scoring would be less successful, and a\r\ncontinuation of this process would soon lead to the ridiculous. For\r\ninstance if the chords were given to the brass the whole passage would\r\nsound heavy, and the soprano recitative in the low and middle register\r\nwould be overpowered. If the _F_ sharp in the double basses were\r\nplayed _arco_ by \'cellos and basses together it would sound clumsy, if\r\nit were given to the bassoons a comic effect would be produced, and if\r\nplayed by the brass it would sound rough and coarse, etc.\r\n\r\nThe object of scoring the same musical phrase in different ways is to\r\nobtain variety either in tone colour or resonance. In each case the\r\ncomposer may resort to the inversion of the normal order of\r\ninstruments, duplication of parts, or the two processes in\r\ncombination. The first of these is not always feasible. In the\r\npreceding sections of the book I have tried to explain the\r\ncharacteristics of each instrument and the part which each group of\r\ninstruments plays in the orchestra. Moreover many methods of doubling\r\nare to be avoided; these I have mentioned, while there are also some\r\ninstruments which cannot be combined owing to the great difference in\r\ntheir peculiarities. Therefore, as regards the general composition of\r\nthe orchestra, the student should be guided by the general principles\r\nlaid down in the earlier stages of the present work.\r\n\r\nThe best means of orchestrating the same musical idea in various ways\r\nis by the adaptation of the musical matter. This can be done by the\r\nfollowing operations: a) complete or partial transference into other\r\noctaves; b) repetition in a different key; c) extension of the whole\r\nrange by the addition of octaves to the upper and lower parts; d)\r\nalteration of details (the most frequent method); e) variation of the\r\ngeneral dynamic scheme, e.g. repeating a phrase _piano_, which has\r\nalready been played _forte_.\r\n\r\nThese operations are always successful in producing variety of\r\norchestral colour.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 176, 177. _Russian Easter F\xc3\xaate_ [[A]] and [[C]].\r\n\r\n_The Christmas Night_ [[158]] and [[179]].\r\n\r\nNo. 178-181. _The Tsar\'s Bride_, Overture: beginning, [[1]], [[2]],\r\n[[7]].\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[99-101]] and [[305-307]] (cf.

In order to simplify the following illustrations I\r\nwill divide the word into two classes, _full tutti_ and _partial\r\ntutti_,--independently of whether the orchestra is constructed in\r\npairs, in three\'s, or a larger number of instruments. I call _full\r\ntutti_ the combination of all melodic groups, strings, wind, and\r\nbrass. By _partial tutti_ I mean passages in which the brass group\r\nonly takes part, whether two horns or two trumpets participate alone,\r\nor whether two horns are combined with one or three trombones, without\r\ntuba, trumpets, or the two remaining horns, etc.:\r\n\r\n[4 Horns, 2 Horns           2 Horns    ]\r\n[...      or 2 Trumpets, or ...  etc.  ]\r\n[...      ...               3 Trombones].\r\n\r\nIn both species of _tutti_ full wood-wind may be employed or not,\r\naccording to the register and musical context of the passage. For\r\ninstance, in the extreme high register it may be essential to include\r\nthe piccolo; in the low register flutes will be unnecessary, and yet\r\nthe passage can still be called _tutti_. The inclusion of\r\nkettle-drums, harp, and other instruments of little sustaining power,\r\nas of the percussion in general, does not come under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe variety of orchestral operations increases with the number of\r\ninstruments forming a _tutti_, in fact, so great does it become that\r\nit is impossible to consider all combinations. I can only give a few\r\nexamples of full and partial _tutti_, and leave the reader to draw his\r\nown conclusions. Some of these examples fall under the double heading\r\nof full and partial _tutti_, and the student is reminded that the\r\n_tutti_ is used essentially in _forte_ and _fortissimo_, rarely in\r\n_pianissimo_ and _piano_ passages.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[61]] and [[62]]--Partial and full _Tutti_.\r\n\r\n       "        [[231]] Partial _Tutti_, without the trumpets\r\n                (cf.

Sometimes this is effected\r\nby the wood-wind alone, but more frequently with the support of horns.\r\nAt other times the horns are found alone without the wood-wind, and,\r\nlastly, a _tutti_ may be comprised of instruments of each group in\r\nvarying numbers. The addition of kettle-drums and the rest of the\r\npercussion is quite common and constitutes what the Germans call\r\n"Janitscharenmusik", or Turkish infantry music. Violoncellos and\r\ndouble basses playing more or less important _pizz._ notes are often\r\nadded to wood-wind instruments (_tutti_), likewise the remainder of\r\nthe strings and the harps; this process renders the sustained notes in\r\nthe wood-wind more distinct. _Tutti_ passages in wood-wind and horns\r\ndo not produce any great amount of power in _forte_ passages, but, on\r\nthe other hand _tutti_ in the brass groups alone may attain an\r\nextraordinary volume of tone.

Whilst the 1st\r\nviolin and 1st \'cello are fairly frequently used in this manner,\r\nthe solo viola is seldom found, and a solo on the double bass is\r\npractically unknown. Phrases demanding particular individuality of\r\nexpression are entrusted to solo instruments; likewise passages that\r\nrequire extraordinary technique, beyond the scope of the orchestral\r\nrank and file. The comparatively weak tone of the solo instrument\r\nnecessitates light, transparent accompaniment. Difficult virtuoso\r\nsolos should not be written, as they attract too much attention to a\r\nparticular instrument. Solo stringed instruments are also used when\r\nvigourous expression and technical facility are not required, but\r\nsimply in order to obtain that singular difference in colour which\r\nexists between a solo stringed instrument and strings in unison.

In\r\nthe first case the flutes and piccolo should be used along with the\r\nupper notes of the violins, _soli_ or _divisi_; in the second case\r\nthe double bassoon and the low notes of the bassoons, bass clarinet,\r\nhorns, trombones and tuba are brought into play.

Nevertheless\r\nthe unusual resonance thus produced serves for strange and grotesque\r\neffects. In the first of the following examples the piccolo figure\r\ndoubled by the harp and the sparkling notes of the _glockenspiel_ is\r\nset about four octaves apart from the bass, which is assigned to a\r\nsingle Double bass and Tuba. But in the 3rd octave, the augmented\r\nfourths and diminished fifths in the two flutes help to fill up the\r\nintermediate space and lessen the distance between the two extreme\r\nparts, thus forming some sort of link between them.

In order to connect the phrases on each instrument in the\r\nbest possible way, the last note of each part is made to coincide with\r\nthe first note of the following one. This method is used for passages\r\nthe range of which is too wide to be performed on any one instrument,\r\nor when it is desired to divide a phrase into two different timbres.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* _Snegourotchka_ [[137]]--The melody is transferred from the violins\r\n                  to the flute and clarinet (cf.

When one instrument is on\r\nthe point of completing its allotted part, another instrument takes up\r\nthe passage, starting on one or two notes common to both parts, and so\r\non.

The most usual practice is to employ chords on different groups of\r\ninstruments alternately. In dealing with chords in different registers\r\ncare should be taken that the progression of parts, though broken in\r\npassing from one group to another, remains as regular as if there\r\nwere no leap from octave to octave; this applies specially to\r\nchromatic passages in order to avoid false relation.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 239. _Ivan the Terrible_, Act II [[29]].\r\n\r\nNo. 240-241.  _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[123]], before [[124]].\r\n\r\n* No. 242-243.

Ex. 109.\r\n\r\n     * _The Christmas Night_, opening (cf. Ex. 106).\r\n\r\n2. Another excellent method consists in transferring _the same chord\r\nor its inversion_ from one orchestral group to another. This operation\r\ndemands perfect balance in progression of parts as well as register.\r\nThe first group strikes a chord of short value, the other group takes\r\npossession of it simultaneously in the same position and distribution,\r\neither in the same octave or in another. The dynamic gradations of\r\ntone need not necessarily be the same in both groups.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, commencement of the overture (cf.

It is used in establishing\r\na _crescendo_. While the first group effects the _crescendo_\r\ngradually, the second group enters _piano_ or _pianissimo_, and\r\nattains its _crescendo_ more rapidly. The whole process is thereby\r\nrendered more tense as the timbre changes. The converse operation--the\r\ntransition from a complex to a simple timbre, by the suppression of\r\none of the groups, belongs essentially to the _diminuendo_.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 245. _Snegourotchka_ [[313]].\r\n\r\n                "        [[140]] (cf.

When a phrase is imitated in the upper register it\r\nshould be given to an instrument of higher range and _vice versa_. If\r\nthis rule is ignored an unnatural effect will be produced, as when the\r\nclarinet in its upper range replies to the oboe in the lower compass\r\netc. The same rule must be followed in dealing with phrases, actually\r\ndifferent, but similar in character; repeated phrases of different\r\ncharacter should be scored in a manner most suitable to each.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[157]], [[161]].\r\n\r\n_Legend of Kitesh_ [[40-41]].\r\n\r\n* No. 251. _Spanish Capriccio_ [[S]].\r\n\r\nIn echo phrases, that is to say imitation entailing not only decrease\r\nin volume of tone but also an effect of distance, the second\r\ninstrument should be weaker than the first, but the two should possess\r\nsome sort of affinity. An echo given to muted brass following the same\r\nphrase not muted produces this distant effect. Muted trumpets are\r\neminently suited to echo a theme in the oboes; flutes also may imitate\r\nclarinets and oboes successfully. A wood-wind instrument cannot be\r\nused to echo the strings, or _vice versa_, on account of the\r\ndissimilarity in timbre. Imitation in octaves (with a decrease in\r\nresonance) creates an effect resembling an echo.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act III [[3]].\r\n\r\nNo. 252. _Sadko_ [[264]].\r\n\r\n* _Spanish Capriccio_ [[E]].--This example is not precisely an echo\r\nbut resembles one in character (cf.

The first method is also\r\nemployed for a _sf-dim._, and the second for a _cresc.-sf_ effect.\r\n\r\nb) It is not so effective, and therefore less frequent to give the\r\nnotes of sustained value to the strings, and the short chords to the\r\nwood-wind. In such cases the _tenuto_ chord is played _tremolando_ on\r\nthe strings.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Vera Scheloga_, before [[35]], [[38]], 10th bar.\r\n\r\n* No. 253. _Legend of Kitesh_, before [[15-16]].\r\n\r\n* _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, 2nd movement, [[P]], 14th bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod of emphasising certain notes and chords.\r\n\r\nIn order to stress or emphasise a certain note or chord, besides the\r\nmarks of expression [music symbol: decrescendo] and _sf_, chords of 2,\r\n3, and 4 notes can be inserted into the melodic progression by the\r\ninstruments of the string quartet, each playing a single note; short\r\nnotes in the wood-wind may also be used as well as a chain of three\r\nor four grace notes, in the form of a scale, either in strings or\r\nwood-wind. These unstressed notes (anacrusis), generally written very\r\nsmall, form a kind of upward glide, the downward direction being less\r\ncommon. As a rule they are connected to the main note by a slur. In\r\nthe strings they should not lead up to chords of three or four notes,\r\nas this would be awkward for the bow.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 254. _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[142]]--Anacrusis in the strings.\r\n\r\n* No. 255. _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, 2nd movement [[C]]--Short _pizz._ chords.\r\n\r\n*                "         "     "     [[P]]--Short wind chords\r\n                                       (cf.

After the strings, the brass\r\nis the group most facile in producing dynamic shades of expression,\r\nglorifying _crescendo_ chords into the most brilliant _sforzando_\r\nclimaxes. Clarinets specialise in _diminuendo_ effects and are capable\r\nof decreasing their tone to a breath (_morendo_). Prolonged orchestral\r\n_crescendi_ are obtained by the gradual addition of other instruments\r\nin the following order: strings, wood-wind, brass. _Diminuendo_\r\neffects are accomplished by the elimination of the instruments in the\r\nreverse order (brass, wood-wind, strings). The scope of this work does\r\nnot lend itself to the quotation of prolonged _crescendo_ and\r\n_diminuendo_ passages. The reader is referred, therefore, to the full\r\nscores:\r\n\r\n* _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_, pp. 5-7, 92-96, 192-200.\r\n\r\n* _Antar_ [[6]], [[51]].\r\n\r\n* _The Christmas Night_ [[183]].\r\n\r\n* _Sadko_ [[165-166]].\r\n\r\n* _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[80-81]].\r\n\r\nMany examples of shorter _crescendi_ and _diminuendi_ will be found in\r\nVol. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiverging and converging progressions.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, diverging and converging progressions simply\r\nconsist in the gradual ascent of the three upper parts, with the bass\r\ndescending. The distance separating the bass from the other parts is\r\ntrifling at first, and grows by degrees. On the other hand, in\r\nconverging progressions, the three upper parts, at first so far\r\ndistant from the bass, gradually approach it. Sometimes these\r\nprogressions involve an increase or a decrease in tone. The\r\nintermediate intervals are filled up by the introduction of fresh\r\nparts as the distance widens, so that the upper parts become doubled\r\nor trebled. In converging progressions the tripled and doubled parts\r\nare simplified, as the duplicating instruments cease to play.\r\nMoreover, if the harmony allows it, the group in the middle region\r\nwhich remains stationary is the group to be retained, or else the\r\nsustained note which guarantees unity in the operation. Below, the\r\nreader will find double examples of both descriptions. The first pair\r\nrepresents a diverging progression, 1. _piano_, in which the human\r\nvoice takes part; 2. a purely orchestral _crescendo_. The second\r\ndepicts two similar diverging progressions, firstly a gradual\r\n_crescendo_, secondly _dim._, during which the strings become more and\r\nmore divided as the wind instruments cease to play. Ex. 258\r\naccompanies the apparition of Mlada, Ex. 259, its disappearance. The\r\natmosphere and colouring are weird and fanciful. The third pair of\r\nexamples forms instances of converging progressions. In the first (Ex.\r\n260) Princess Volkhova relates the wonders of the sea. Then in the\r\nmiddle of a powerful orchestral _crescendo_ the Sea-King appears (Ex.\r\n261). Both examples include a sustained stationary chord of the\r\ndiminished seventh.

But it\r\nwould be ill-advised to lay down any hard and fast rule as to the\r\npermissible length of these notes. There is no doubt that the harmonic\r\nnotes, the thirds of the fundamental one (_E_) are more prominent from\r\ntheir proximity with the notes extraneous to the harmony. If the\r\nnumber of parts is increased (for instance, if the melodic figure is\r\nin thirds, sixths etc.), the question becomes still more complicated,\r\nsince, to the original harmonic scheme, chords with different root\r\nbases are added, producing false relation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for the solution of such problems, orchestration\r\nprovides an element of the greatest importance: difference of timbres.\r\nThe greater the dissimilarity in timbre between the harmonic basis on\r\nthe one hand and the melodic design on the other, the less discordant\r\nthe notes extraneous to the harmony will sound. The best example of\r\nthis is to be found between the human voice and the orchestra, next\r\ncomes the difference of timbres between the groups of strings,\r\nwood-wind, plucked strings and percussion instruments. Less important\r\ndifferences occur between wood-wind and brass; in these two groups,\r\ntherefore, the harmonic basis generally remains an octave removed from\r\nthe melodic design, and should be of inferior dynamic power.\r\n\r\n_Examples of harmonic basis in chords:_\r\n\r\nNo. 264. _Pan Voyevoda_, Introduction.\r\n\r\n_Legend of Kitesh_, Introduction (cf. also Ex. 125 and 140).\r\n\r\n* _Mlada_, Act III [[10]].\r\n\r\nThe harmonic basis may be ornamental in character, in which case it\r\nshould move independently of the concurrent melodic design.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* No. 265-266. _Tsar Saltan_ [[103-104]], [[128]], [[149]],\r\n[[162-165]] (cf. below).\r\n\r\nChords the most widely opposed in character may be used on a simple,\r\nstationary harmonic basis, a basis, founded, for example, on the chord\r\nof the tonic or diminished seventh.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 267. _Legend of Kitesh_ [[326-328]]--Wood-wind and harps on a\r\nstring basis.\r\n\r\nNo. 268-269. _Kashtche\xc3\xaf the Immortal_ [[33]], [[43]].\r\n\r\nNo. 270. _Mlada_, Act II, before [[17]], [[18]]], [[20]].\r\n\r\nNo. 271. _The Golden Cockerel_ [[125]]--Chords of the diminished\r\nseventh, on arpeggio basis (augmented fifth).\r\n\r\nThe effect of alternating harmony produced between two melodic\r\nfigures, e.g. one transmitting a note, held in abeyance, to the other,\r\nor the simultaneous progression of a figure in augmentation and\r\ndiminution etc. becomes comprehensible and pleasant to the ear when\r\nthe fundamental sustained harmony is different.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Legend of Kitesh_ [[34]], [[36]], [[297]] (cf.

An\r\ninsignificant and playful rhythm is suitable to the triangle,\r\ntambourine, castanets and side drum, a vigourous and straightforward\r\nrhythm may be given to the bass drum, cymbals and gong. The strokes on\r\nthese instruments should almost invariably correspond to the strong\r\nbeats of the bar, highly-accented syncopated notes or disconnected\r\n_sforzandi_. The triangle, side drum and tambourine are capable of\r\nvarious rhythmic figures. Sometimes the percussion is used separately,\r\nindependently of any other group of instruments.\r\n\r\nThe brass and wood-wind are the two groups which combine the most\r\nsatisfactorily with percussion from the standpoint of colour. The\r\ntriangle, side drum, and tambourine go best with harmony in the upper\r\nregister; cymbals, bass drum and gong with harmony in the lower. The\r\nfollowing are the combinations most generally employed: _tremolo_ on\r\nthe triangle and tambourine with trills in wood-wind and violins;\r\n_tremolo_ on the side drum, or cymbals struck with drum sticks, and\r\nsustained chords on trumpets and horns; _tremolo_ on the bass drum or\r\nthe gong with chords on trombones or low sustained notes on \'cellos\r\nand double basses. It must not be forgotten that the bass drum,\r\ncymbals, gong and a _tremolo_ on the side drum, played _fortissimo_,\r\nis sufficient to overpower any orchestral _tutti_.\r\n\r\n* The reader will find instances of the use of percussion instruments\r\nin any full score, and in several examples of the present work.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* _Sh\xc3\xa9h\xc3\xa9razade_ pp. 107-119, also many passages in 4th movement.\r\n\r\n* _Antar_ [[40]], [[43]] (cf.

The favourite group\r\nof instruments is the strings, then follow in order the wood-wind,\r\nbrass, kettle-drums, harps, _pizzicato_ effects, and lastly the\r\npercussion, also, in point of order, triangle, cymbals, big drum, side\r\ndrum, tambourine, gong. Further removed stand the celesta,\r\n_glockenspiel_ and xylophone, which instruments, though melodic, are\r\ntoo characteristic in timbre to be employed over frequently. The same\r\nmay be said of the piano and castanets. A quantity of national\r\ninstruments not included in the present work may be incorporated into\r\nthe orchestra; such are the guitar, the domra, zither, mandoline, the\r\noriental tambourine, small tambourine etc. These instruments are\r\nemployed from time to time for descriptive-aesthetic purposes.\r\n\r\nThese instruments are most frequently used in the above-named order. A\r\ngroup of instruments which has been silent for some time gains fresh\r\ninterest upon its reappearance. The trombones, trumpets and tuba are\r\noccasionally _tacet_ for long periods, the percussion is seldom\r\nemployed, and practically never all together, but in single\r\ninstruments or in two\'s and three\'s. In national dances or music in\r\nballad style, percussion instruments may be used more freely.\r\n\r\nAfter a long rest the re-entry of the horns, trombones and tuba should\r\ncoincide with some characteristic intensity of tone, either _pp_ or\r\n_ff_; _piano_ and _forte_ re-entries are less successful, while\r\nre-introducing these instruments _mezzo-forte_ or _mezzo-piano_\r\nproduces a colourless and common-place effect. This remark is capable\r\nof wider application. For the same reasons it is not good to commence\r\nor finish any piece of music either _mf_ or _mp_. The scope of the\r\nmusical examples in this work does not permit of illustrating by\r\nquotation the use of economy in orchestral colour, nor the re-entry of\r\ninstruments thrown into prominence by prolonged rests. The reader must\r\nexamine these questions in full scores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nCOMBINATION OF THE HUMAN VOICE WITH ORCHESTRA. THE STAGE BAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrchestral accompaniment of solo voices.\r\n\r\nGeneral remarks.\r\n\r\nIn accompanying the voice orchestral scoring should be light enough\r\nfor the singer to make free use of all the dynamic shades of\r\nexpression without hardness of tone. In overflowing lyrical moments,\r\nwhere full voice is required, the singer should be well supported by\r\nthe orchestra.\r\n\r\nOpera singing may be divided into two general classes, lyric singing\r\nand declamation or recitative. The full, round, _legato_ aria affords\r\ngreater facility for tone production than florid music or recitative,\r\nand the more movement and rhythmic detail contained in the vocal part,\r\nthe greater freedom and liberty must there be given to the voice. In\r\nsuch a case the latter should not be doubled by the orchestra, neither\r\nshould rhythmical figures be written for any instrument corresponding\r\nwith those in the vocal part. In accompanying the voice the composer\r\nshould bear these points in mind before turning his attention to the\r\nchoice of orchestral colour. A confused, heavy accompaniment will\r\noverpower the singer; an accompaniment which is too simple in\r\ncharacter will lack interest, and one which is too weak will not\r\nsustain the voice sufficiently.\r\n\r\nIn modern opera it is rare that orchestral writing is confined to\r\naccompaniment pure and simple. It frequently happens that the\r\nprincipal musical idea, often complex in character, is contained in\r\nthe orchestra. The voice may then be said to form the accompaniment,\r\nexchanging musical for literary interest. It becomes subordinate to\r\nthe orchestra, as though it were an extra part, subsequently added as\r\nan after-thought. But it is evident that great care must be taken with\r\norchestral writing in such cases. The scoring must not be so heavy or\r\ncomplicated as to drown the voice and prevent the words from being\r\nheard, thereby breaking the thread of the text, and leaving the\r\nmusical imagery unexplained. Certain moments may require great volume\r\nof orchestral tone, so great that a voice of even phenomenal power is\r\nincapable of being heard. Even if the singer is audible, such unequal\r\nstruggles between voice and orchestra are most inartistic, and the\r\ncomposer should reserve his orchestral outbursts for the intervals\r\nduring which the voice is silent, distributing the singer\'s phrases\r\nand pauses in a free and natural manner, according to the sense of the\r\nwords. If a prolonged _forte_ passage occurs in the orchestra it may\r\nbe used concurrently with action on the stage. All artificial\r\nreduction of tone contrary to the true feeling of a passage, the sole\r\nobject being to allow the voice to come through, should be strictly\r\navoided, as it deprives orchestral writing of its distinctive\r\nbrilliance. It must also be remembered that too great a disparity in\r\nvolume of tone between purely orchestral passages and those which\r\naccompany the voice create an inartistic comparison. Therefore, when\r\nthe orchestra is strengthened by the use of wood-wind in three\'s or\r\nfour\'s, and brass in large numbers, the division of tone and colour\r\nmust be manipulated skillfully and with the greatest care.\r\n\r\nIn previous sections I have frequently stated that the structure of\r\nthe orchestra is closely related to the music itself. The scoring of a\r\nvocal work proves this relationship in a striking manner, and, indeed,\r\nit may be stipulated that _only that which is well written can be well\r\norchestrated_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransparence of accompaniment. Harmony.\r\n\r\nThe group of strings is the most transparent medium and the one least\r\nlikely to overpower the voice. Then come the wood-wind and the brass,\r\nthe latter in the following order: horns, trombones, trumpets. A\r\ncombination of strings, _pizz._, and the harp forms a setting\r\neminently favourable for the voice. As a general rule a singer is more\r\neasily overpowered by long sustained notes than by short detached\r\nones. Strings doubled in the wood-wind and brass, and brass doubled\r\nby wood-wind are combinations liable to drown the singer. This may be\r\ndone even more easily by _tremolando_ in the kettle-drums and other\r\npercussion instruments, which, even by themselves are capable of\r\noverpowering any other orchestral group of instruments. Doubling of\r\nwood-wind and horns, and the use of two clarinets, two oboes or two\r\nhorns in unison to form one harmonic part is likewise to be avoided,\r\nas such combinations will have a similar effect on the voice. The\r\nfrequent use of long sustained notes in the double basses is another\r\ncourse unfavourable to the singer; these notes in combination with the\r\nhuman voice produce a peculiar throbbing effect.\r\n\r\nJuxtaposition of strings and wood-wind which overweights _legato_ or\r\ndeclamatory singing may nevertheless be employed if one of the groups\r\nforms the harmony in sustained notes and the other executes a melodic\r\ndesign, when, for instance the sustaining instruments are clarinet,\r\nand bassoon, or bassoon and horn, and the melodic design is entrusted\r\nto violins or violas--or in the opposite case, when the harmony is\r\ngiven to violas and \'cellos _divisi_, and the harmonic [Transcriber\'s\r\nNote: melodic] figure to the clarinets.\r\n\r\nSustained harmony in the register of the second octave to the middle\r\nof the third does not overpower women\'s voices, as these develop\r\n_outside_ this range; neither is it too heavy for men\'s voices, which\r\nalthough opening out _within_ the range itself sound an octave higher,\r\nas in the case of the tenor voice. As a rule women\'s voices suffer\r\nmore than men\'s when they come in contact with harmony in a register\r\nsimilar to their own. Taken separately, and used in moderation, each\r\ngroup of orchestral instruments may be considered favourable to each\r\ntype of voice. But the combination of two or three groups cannot be so\r\nconsidered unless they each play an independent part and are not\r\nunited together at full strength. Incessant four-part harmony is to be\r\ndeprecated. Satisfactory results will be obtained when the number of\r\nharmonic parts is gradually decreased, with some of them sustaining\r\npedal notes, and when the harmony, interspersed with necessary pauses\r\nis confined to the limits of one octave, distributed over several\r\noctaves, or duplicated in the higher register.\r\n\r\nThese manipulations allow the composer to come to the singer\'s aid; in\r\nvoice-modulations, when the singer passes from the _cantabile_ to the\r\ndeclamatory style, the composer may reduce or eliminate some harmony\r\nwhich is found to be too heavy as the vocal tone diminishes, and\r\nconversely, support the voice by a fuller orchestral tone in broad\r\nphrases and climaxes.\r\n\r\nOrnamental writing and polyphonic accompaniment should never be too\r\nintricate in character, entailing the use of an unnecessary number of\r\ninstruments. Some complicated figures are better partially entrusted\r\nto _pizz._ strings and harp, as this combination has little chance of\r\noverpowering the voice. Some examples of accompanying an _aria_ are\r\ngiven below.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_The Tsar\'s Bride_, Lykow\'s supplementary _Aria_ (Act III).\r\n\r\n  "    "      "     [[16-19]]--Griasnov\'s _Aria_.\r\n\r\nNo. 277. _Snegourotchka_ [[45]].\r\n\r\n* _Snegourotchka_ [[187-188]], [[212-213]] the two Cavatinas of Tsar\r\nBerendey (cf. extracts, Ex. 102, 225).\r\n\r\nNo. 278. _Sadko_ [[143]].\r\n\r\n            "    [[204-206]]--The Venetian\'s Song.\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Kitesh_ [[39-41]], [[222-223]] (cf.

The most natural duplication in unison of womens\'\r\nvoices is performed by violins, violas, clarinets and oboes; that of\r\nmens\' voices by violas, \'cellos, bassoons and horns. Doubling in\r\noctaves is usually done in the upper register. Trombones and trumpets\r\noverpower the voice and cannot be used for this purpose. Uninterrupted\r\nor too frequent duplication should be avoided, not only because the\r\noperation deprives the singer of full freedom of expression, but also\r\nbecause it replaces by a mixed timbre the rare characteristic\r\nqualities of the human voice. Doubling, when limited to a few special\r\nphrases supports the voice and endows it with beauty and colour. It is\r\nonly suitable _in tempo_; to apply it, in unison or octaves to a\r\npassage _ad. lib._ is both ineffective and dangerous.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[50-52]]--Snegourotchka\'s Arietta (cf. Ex. 41).\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[309-311]]--Volkhova\'s Cradle-song (cf. Ex. 81).\r\n\r\nBesides the question of doubling the voice for the object of colour\r\nthere are instances when the singer executes only part of a phrase,\r\nallotted in its entirely to an orchestral instrument.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\n_Vera Scheloga_ [[30]], [[36]] (cf. Ex. 49).\r\n\r\nLyrical climaxes, _a piena voce_, or dramatic passages for the voice\r\nsituated outside its normal range should be supported melodically and\r\nharmonically by the orchestra, in the register in which the voice is\r\nplaced. The culminating point in such passages often coincides with\r\nthe entry or sudden attack of the trombones or other brass\r\ninstruments, or by a rush of strings. Strengthening the accompaniment\r\nin this manner will soften the tone of the voice.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 280. _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[206]].\r\n\r\n_Servilia_ [[126-127]].\r\n\r\n    "      [[232]].\r\n\r\nNo. 281. _Sadko_ [[314]].\r\n\r\n_Vera Scheloga_ [[41]].\r\n\r\nIf the culminating point is soft in colour and outline it is better\r\nleft unsupported in the orchestra, but sometimes the wood-wind,\r\nsustaining such passages with light transparent melody or harmony may\r\nproduce an entrancing effect.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[188]].\r\n\r\n       "        [[318]] (cf. Ex. 119).\r\n\r\nNo. 282. _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[214]].\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice to support voices in concerted numbers by\r\nharmony and duplication; this operation makes for accuracy and\r\nbrilliance when applied to duets, trios, quartets etc.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[292-293]]--Duet (cf.

Ex. 305).\r\n\r\nThe beautiful effect produced by a solo instrument accompanying a\r\n_cantabile aria_ cannot be denied. In such cases the instruments used\r\nare generally the violin, viola, and \'cello, or the flute, oboe, Eng.\r\nhorn, clar., bass clar., bassoon, horn and harp. The accompaniment is\r\noften contrapuntal or composed of polyphonic designs. The solo\r\ninstrument either plays alone or as the leading melodic voice in the\r\n_ensemble_. In combination with the voice, or associated with some\r\naction on the stage, a solo instrument is a powerful expedient for\r\nmusical characterisation. Instances of this description are numerous.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[50]]--Soprano and oboe (cf. Ex. 41).\r\n\r\n       "        [[97]]--Contralto and Eng. horn.\r\n\r\n       "        [[243]], [[246]]--Baritone and bass clar.\r\n                (cf.

Ex. 226).\r\n\r\nIt is comparatively rare for percussion instruments to take part in\r\naccompanying the voice. The triangle is occasionally used, the cymbals\r\nless frequently. An accompaniment may be formed by a figure or a\r\n_tremolo_ on the kettle-drums.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[97]], [[224]], [[247]] (Lell\'s 1st and 3rd\r\nsongs).\r\n\r\n_Tsar Saltan_, before [[5]].\r\n\r\n* No. 285. _The Golden Cockerel_ [[135]]; cf. also [[161]], [[197]].\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of powerful and expressive orchestral\r\npassages, the voice _tacet_:\r\n\r\nNo. 286. _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[81]].\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Kitesh_ [[282]], [[298]].\r\n\r\n* _Servilia_ [[130]].\r\n\r\n\r\nRecitative and declamation.\r\n\r\nThe accompaniment of recitative and melodic declamatory phrases should\r\nbe light enough to allow the voice to come through without strain, and\r\nthe words to be heard distinctly. The most convenient method is to\r\nemploy sustained chords and _tremolo_ on the strings or wood-wind,\r\ngiving free latitude to the voice from a rhythmic point of view (_a\r\npiacere_).\r\n\r\nAnother excellent plan is to write short chords in the strings\r\ncombined with wood-wind in different ways. Sustained chords and those\r\nentailing change of position should occur preferably when the voice is\r\nsilent, thus permitting both conductor and orchestra to keep a closer\r\nwatch over the singer\'s irregularities of rhythm in _a piacere_\r\nrecitatives. If the accompaniment is more complex in character,\r\nmelodic, polyphonic or ornamental in design, the recitative must be\r\nsung _in tempo_. Any phrase which it is necessary to emphasise in\r\naccordance with the sense of the words assumes a more _cantabile_\r\ncharacter, and must be reinforced by the orchestra. Opera, today,\r\nbesides demanding much greater care in the treatment of the text than\r\nin the past, abounds in constant transition from declamation to\r\n_cantabile_, or in the fusion of the two. The orchestra offers more\r\nvariety of texture and must be handled with greater regard to its\r\nrelationship to the words, and the action on the stage. This class of\r\norchestration can only be studied from lengthy examples. I refer the\r\nreader to operatic full scores and content myself with giving one or\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: \'two\' missing in original] short instances:\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 287. _Snegourotchka_ [[16]].\r\n\r\nNo. 288. _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[124-125]].\r\n\r\nThe following double examples, similar from a musical point of view,\r\nshow different methods of handling an orchestra from the standpoint of\r\naccompaniment to the voice, and the _tutti_ form.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 289-291. _Sadko_ [[99-101]] and [[305-307]] (compare also Ex. 75).\r\n\r\n_Vera Scheloga_ [[3-7]] and [[28]].\r\n\r\nCare should be taken not to score too heavily when accompanying\r\nsingers in the wings.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* No. 292. _Sadko_ [[316]], [[318]], [[320]].\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Kitesh_ [[286-289]], [[304-305]].\r\n\r\n\r\nOrchestral accompaniment of the chorus.\r\n\r\nThe chorus, possessing much greater unity and power than the solo\r\nvoice, does not demand such careful handling in the accompaniment. On\r\nthe contrary, too great a refinement of orchestral treatment will\r\nprove harmful to the resonance of the chorus. As a general rule\r\norchestration of choral works follows the rules laid down for purely\r\ninstrumental scoring. It is obvious that dynamic marks of expression\r\nmust correspond in both bodies, but doubling one orchestral group with\r\nanother and coupling instruments of the same kind in unison (2 Ob., 2\r\nCl., 4 Horns, 3 Trombones etc.) are both possible operations, if\r\nperformed according to the requirements of the musical context.\r\nDoubling choral parts by instruments is generally a good plan. In\r\n_cantabile_ passages such duplication may be melodic in character,\r\nand the design more ornamental in the orchestra than in the chorus.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act II [[3-6]]; Act III [[66-69]].\r\n\r\n_The May Night_, Act I [[X-Y]]; Act III [[L-Ee]], [[Ddd-Fff]].\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[61-73]], [[147-153]], [[323-328]].\r\n\r\n_Mlada_, Act II [[22-31]], [[45-63]]; Act IV [[31-36]].\r\n\r\n_The Christmas Night_ [[59-61]], [[115-123]].\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[37-39]], [[50-53]], [[79-86]], [[173]], [[177]], [[187]],\r\n[[189]], [[218-221]], [[233]], [[270-273]].\r\n\r\n_The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[29-30]], [[40-42]], [[50-59]], [[141]].\r\n\r\n_Tsar Saltan_ [[67-71], [[91-93]], [[133-145]], [[207-208]].\r\n\r\n_Legend of Kitesh_ [[167]], [[177-178]].\r\n\r\n_The Golden Cockerel_ [[237-238]], [[262-264]].\r\n\r\nThe reader will find instances of choral accompaniment in many\r\nexamples relating to other sections of the work.\r\n\r\nIn the case of solitary exclamations or phrases in recitative, melodic\r\ndoubling is not always suitable. It is better to support the voice\r\nsimply by harmonic duplication.\r\n\r\nThe repetition of notes--required by declamation--forming no\r\nfundamental part of the rhythmical structure of a phrase or chord\r\nshould not be reproduced in the orchestra; the melodic or harmonic\r\nbasis alone should be doubled. Sometimes the rhythmical structure of a\r\nchoral phrase is simplified in comparison with its orchestral\r\nduplication.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 293. _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[96]].\r\n\r\nNo. 294. _Ivan the Terrible_, Act I, before [[75]].\r\n\r\nChoral passages, the musical context of which is complete in itself,\r\nforming a chorus _a cappella_ often remain undoubled by the orchestra,\r\naccompanied solely by sustained notes or an independent polyphonic\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 295. _Sadko_ [[219]].\r\n\r\n* _Tsar Saltan_ [[207]].\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Kitesh_ [[167]] (cf. Ex. 116).\r\n\r\n* _The Golden Cockerel_ [[236]].\r\n\r\nHeavier scoring is required for a mixed chorus; for a male voice\r\nchorus the orchestration should be lighter; still more so for women\'s\r\nvoices alone. In scoring a certain passage the composer should not\r\nlose sight of the number of choristers he is employing, for scenic\r\nconditions may necessitate a reduction of that figure. The approximate\r\nnumber should be marked in the full score as a basis upon which to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 296. _Ivan the Terrible_, Act II [[37]].\r\n\r\n* _Sadko_ [[17]], [[20]].\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Kitesh_ [[61]] (cf.

A woman\'s solo voice stands out\r\nwell against a male voice chorus, likewise a solo male voice against a\r\nwomen\'s chorus, for in both cases, the timbre of the solo voice\r\ndiffers from the rest. But the combination of solo voice and chorus,\r\nof the same timbre, or mixed chorus, creates a certain amount of\r\ndifficulty. In such cases the soloist should sing in a higher register\r\nthan the chorus, the former _a piena voce_, the latter _piano_. The\r\nsoloist should stand as near to the footlights as possible; the chorus\r\nup-stage. The orchestration should be adapted to the soloist, not to\r\nthe chorus.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 298. _Snegourotchka_ [[143]].\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible._ Act II [[37]] (cf.

More modern composers have\r\nabandoned this clumsy practice, not only unfortunate from the\r\nspectators\' point of view, but also detrimental to the mediaeval or\r\nlegendary setting of the majority of operas. Only those stage\r\ninstruments are now used which suit the scene and surroundings in\r\nwhich the opera is laid. As regards instruments in the wings,\r\ninvisible to the audience, the question is simple. Nevertheless, for\r\nthe musician of today the choice of these instruments must be\r\nregulated by aesthetic considerations of greater importance than those\r\ngoverning the selection of a military band. The instruments are played\r\nin the wings, those visible on the stage are only for ornament.\r\nSometimes stage-instruments may be replicas of those common to the\r\nperiod which the opera represents, (the sacred horns in _Mlada_, for\r\nexample).

In Russian opera the strings are employed in this way by\r\nRubinstein (_Gorioucha_), and in a splendidly characteristic manner by\r\nSerov (_Hostile Power_): in the latter opera the _E_ flat clarinet is\r\nused to imitate the fife in the Carnival procession.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Mention should be made of the happy use of a small\r\norchestra in the wings (2 picc., 2 cl., 2 horns, 1 trombone,\r\ntambourine, 4 Vns, 2 violas, 1 D-bass) in _The May Night_, Act II,\r\nSc. I. [[M-P]]. (Editor\'s note.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI (Supplementary).\r\n\r\nVOICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Terms.\r\n\r\nAmong all the confused terms employed in singing to denote the\r\ncompass, register and character of the human voice, there are four\r\nwhich may be said to represent elemental types: soprano, alto or\r\ncontralto, tenor and bass. These names are used to denote the\r\ncomposition of the chorus with sub-divisions of _firsts_ and\r\n_seconds_, to determine how the parts must be divided. (Sopr. I, Sopr.\r\nII etc.) While the range of an instrument is exactly governed by its\r\nconstruction, the compass of the voice, on the other hand, depends on\r\nthe individuality of the singer. It is therefore impossible to define\r\nthe exact limits of each of these vocal types. When it is a question\r\nof dividing choristers into 1st and 2nd parts, those with the\r\nhigher voices are classed among the firsts and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nBesides the principal terms mentioned above, the names mezzo-soprano\r\n(between sop. and alto), and baritone (between tenor and bass) are\r\nalso employed.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In the chorus mezzo-sopranos are classed with 2nd\r\n     sopranos or 1st altos, baritones with 2nd tenors or\r\n     first basses, according to quality and timbre of voice.\r\n\r\nApart from these denominations which represent the six principal solo\r\nvoices, a quantity of others are in use to denote either compass,\r\ntimbre or technique, such as light soprano, _soprano giusto_, lyric\r\nsoprano, dramatic soprano, light tenor, _tenorino-altino_,\r\n_baryton-martin_, lyric tenor, dramatic tenor, _basso cantante_\r\n("singing bass"), _basso profondo_ (deep bass) etc. To this lengthy\r\nlist must be added the term _mezzo-carattere_, of intermediate\r\ncharacter (between lyric and dramatic soprano, for example).\r\n\r\nIf we try to discover the real meaning of these designations it soon\r\nbecomes apparent that they are derived from widely different\r\nsources--for instance, "light soprano" implies agility and mobility in\r\nthe voice; "dramatic tenor", the power to express strong dramatic\r\nfeeling; _basso profondo_ signifies great resonance in the deep\r\nregister.\r\n\r\nMinute examination of all the methods of attack and emission of sound\r\nlies within the province of the singing master and to enumerate them\r\nhere would only perplex the student. The same applies to the position\r\nand exact limits of register (chest voice, middle and head voice in\r\nwomen; chest voice, mixed voice and falsetto in men). The work of a\r\nteacher of singing consists in equalising the voice throughout its\r\nwhole compass, so that the transition from one register to another, on\r\nall the vowels, may be accomplished imperceptibly. Some voices are\r\nnaturally even and flexible. The professor of singing must correct\r\nfaults in breathing, determine the range of the voice and place it,\r\nequalise its tone, increase its flexibility, instruct as to the\r\npronunciation of vowels, modulation from one grade of expression to\r\nanother, etc. A composer should be able to rely upon flexible and\r\nequal voices without having to trouble himself as to the abilities or\r\ndefects of individual singers. In these days a part is seldom written\r\nfor a particular artist, and composers and librettists do not find it\r\nnecessary to entrust a certain r\xc3\xb4le to _fioriture_ singers, another to\r\nheavy dramatic voices. Poetic and artistic considerations demand\r\ngreater variety of resource in the study of opera or vocal music in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoloists.\r\n\r\nRange and register.\r\n\r\nI advise the composer to be guided by Table F. which gives the\r\napproximate range of the six principal solo voices. A bracket under\r\nthe notes defines the normal octave, the register in which the voice\r\nis generally used. Within these limits the composer may write freely\r\nwithout fear of hardening or tiring the voice. The normal octave\r\napplies also to declamatory singing and recitative; the notes above it\r\nare exceptional and should be used for the culminating points of a\r\npassage or for climaxes, the notes below, for the fall or decline of a\r\nmelody. Employing voices in unusual registers for long periods of time\r\nwill weary both singer and listener, but these registers may\r\noccasionally be used for brief intervals so as not to confine the\r\nvoice too strictly to one octave. A few examples are added to\r\nillustrate melody in different types of voices.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[102-109]] (for extracts cf. Ex. 256, 280,\r\n                   284)--Marfa\'s Aria (Soprano).\r\n\r\n  "    "      "    [[16-18]]--Griaznov\'s Aria (Baritone).\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_--The 3 songs of Lell. (Contralto).\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[46-49]] (cf. extract, Ex. 120)--Sadko\'s Aria (Tenor).\r\n\r\n   "    [[129-131]]--Lioubava\'s Aria (Mezzo-sopr.).\r\n\r\n   "    [[191-193]] (cf. extract, Ex. 131)--Bass Aria.\r\n\r\n\r\nVocalisation.\r\n\r\nA good vocal melody should contain notes of at least three different\r\nvalues, minims, crotchets and quavers (or crotchets, quavers and\r\nsemiquavers etc.). Monotony in rhythmic construction is unsuited to\r\nvocal melody; it is applicable to instrumental music, but only in\r\ncertain cases. _Cantabile_ melody requires a fair number of long\r\nnotes, and a change of syllable in a word should occur at a moment\r\nwhen the voice quits a long sustained note. Short, single notes,\r\nchanging with every syllable produce a harmonious effect. Owing to the\r\nrequirements of diction, extended melodic figures sung _legato_ on one\r\nsyllable must be used with care on the part of the composer; to\r\nperform these the singer must possess greater command over flexibility\r\nand technique. The possibility of taking breath in the right place is\r\none of the conditions essential to all vocal writing. Breath cannot be\r\ntaken in the middle of a word, sometimes not even during the course of\r\na sentence or phrase in the text; hence the voice part must be\r\nsuitably interspersed with rests.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable F. Voices.\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\n\r\n[Music: Soprano.\r\n\r\nContralto.\r\n\r\nTenor.\r\n\r\nBass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSoloists:\r\n\r\n[Music:\r\n\r\nSoprano.\r\nMezzo-soprano.\r\nContralto.\r\nTenor.\r\nBaritone.\r\nBass.]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ It must be remembered that there are some words upon\r\n     which the voice may not dwell, or sing more than one or two\r\n     notes. These words may be nouns, pronouns, numerals,\r\n     prepositions, conjunctions and other parts of speech. It\r\n     would be impossible and ridiculous, for instance, to write a\r\n     sustained note on such words as "who", "he" etc. The voice\r\n     may dwell on certain words which, so to speak, possess some\r\n     poetical colour.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Here the author approaches a question so well known to\r\nthe Russians that it does not require any further elucidation for\r\ntheir guidance. But a whole book would have to be written to form a\r\ncompendium of practical rules on this subject, and to point out the\r\nerrors which nearly all French composers openly commit--even those who\r\nare famous for their sense of diction and literary style. We can only\r\nconclude that the question has come to be considered of minor\r\nimportance in France, perhaps on account of the lack of definite\r\nstress on the syllables of words, which is characteristic of the\r\nFrench language. It is not within the translator\'s province to discuss\r\nthe question of French versification or to elaborate the excellent\r\nmaxims laid down by Rimsky-Korsakov, the first, among many, to touch\r\nupon this delicate and important subject. (Translator\'s note.)]\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 303. _Sadko_ [[236]]--Sadko\'s Aria (Tenor).\r\n\r\n            "    [[309-311]] (see extract, Ex. 81).

The difference in the position of the mouth and lips in\r\nforming the open vowel =a= and the closed vowel =ou= is apparent to\r\neveryone. The series of vowels from the point of view of open sounds\r\nis: =a=, =i=, =o=, =e=, =u=. In women\'s voices the easiest vowel on\r\nhigh notes is =a=, for men it is =o=. The vowel =i= softens the\r\npenetrating quality of the top notes of a bass voice, and the vowel\r\n=a= adds to the extension of range in the very lowest compass. Lengthy\r\nflorid passages are often written on the interjection =ah=, or simply\r\non the vowel =a=. Owing to the restrictions imposed by literary and\r\ndramatic laws, the composer can only follow the above rules to a\r\nlimited extent.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[293]], [[318-319]] (cf. Ex. 119).\r\n\r\nNo. 304. _Sadko_ [[83]].\r\n\r\n\r\nFlexibility.\r\n\r\nVoices possess the greatest amount of flexibility in their normal\r\noctave. Women\'s voices are more supple than men\'s, but in all types,\r\nthe higher voice is the more agile, sopranos in women, the tenor voice\r\nin men. Although capable of performing florid and complicated figures,\r\ndifferent varieties of phrasing and the rapid change from staccato to\r\nlegato, the human voice is infinitely less flexible than a musical\r\ninstrument. In passages of any rapidity, diatonic scales and\r\n_arpeggios_ in thirds come easiest to the voice. Intervals bigger than\r\nfourths in quick succession and chromatic scales are extremely\r\ndifficult. Skips of an octave or more starting from a short note\r\nshould always be avoided. Preparation should precede any extremely\r\nhigh note either by leading up to it gradually, or by the clear leap\r\nof a fourth, fifth or octave; but sometimes the voice may attack a\r\nhigh note without any due preparation.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[46-48]] (cf. extract, Ex. 279)--Snegourotchka\'s\r\n                Aria (Soprano).\r\n\r\n       "        [[96-97]]--Lell\'s first song (Contralto).\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[196-193]] [Transcriber\'s Note: so in original] (cf. extract,\r\n        Ex. 122)--Hindoo song (Tenor).\r\n\r\n   "    [[203-206]]--Venetian song (Baritone).\r\n\r\n_Pan Voyevoda_ [[20-26]]--Maria\'s cradle song (Sopr).\r\n\r\n\r\nColour and character of voices.\r\n\r\nThe colouring of the voice, whether it be brilliant or dull, sombre or\r\nsonorous depends upon the individual singer, and the composer has no\r\nneed to consider it. The chief question is interpretation and may be\r\nsolved by the judicious choice of artists. From the point of view of\r\nflexibility and expression voices may be divided into two classes,\r\n_lyric_ and _dramatic_. The latter is more powerful and of greater\r\nrange, the former possesses more suppleness and elasticity and is more\r\nreadily disposed to different shades of expression. Granted that the\r\nrare combination of the two classes is the composer\'s ideal, he should\r\nnevertheless be content to follow the main artistic purpose which he\r\nhas set out the [Transcriber\'s Note: to] achieve. In complicated and\r\nimportant works the composer should bear in mind the characteristics\r\nof the various voices he employs; moreover, if he use two voices of\r\nthe same calibre, e.g. 2 Sopranos or 2 Tenors, he should discriminate\r\nbetween the range and register of their respective parts, writing for\r\none slightly higher than the other. It is no rare occurrence to meet\r\nwith voices of an intermediate character (mezzo-carattere) combining\r\nthe qualities of each type to a modified extent. To such voices the\r\ncomposer may assign r\xc3\xb4les demanding the characteristics of each class,\r\nespecially secondary r\xc3\xb4les. At the present day, besides the r\xc3\xb4les\r\nsuitable to the dramatic and lyric type of voice, it is customary to\r\ngive prominence to those demanding some special qualifications, voices\r\nof a certain tenderness or power, a specified range or degree of\r\nflexibility--attributes decided by the artistic object in view. In\r\ncasting secondary and minor r\xc3\xb4les the composer is advised to employ a\r\nmedium range and less exacting demands on technique.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ After Meyerbeer, who was the first to write for a\r\n     special type of heavy mezzo-soprano and baritone, Richard\r\n     Wagner created a type of powerful dramatic soprano, of\r\n     extensive range, combining the quality and scope of the\r\n     soprano and mezzo-soprano voices; likewise a similar type of\r\n     tenor, possessing the attributes and compass of the tenor\r\n     and baritone together. To demand that voices shall be\r\n     equally brilliant and resonant in the high and low register,\r\n     that singers shall be endowed with a super-powerful\r\n     breathing apparatus and an extraordinary faculty for\r\n     resistance to fatigue (Siegfried, Parsifal, Tristan,\r\n     Br\xc3\xbcnhilda, Kundry, Isolda), is to exact something little\r\n     short of the miraculous. Such voices are to be found, but\r\n     there are some singers with excellent though not phenomenal\r\n     vocal powers, who, by the constant pursuit of Wagnerian\r\n     parts endeavour to increase their range and volume, and only\r\n     succeed in depriving the voice of correct intonation, beauty\r\n     of tone, and all subtlety of _nuances_. I believe that less\r\n     exacting demands and greater perception of what is required,\r\n     skilful and judicious use of the high and low registers of\r\n     the voice, a proper understanding of _cantabile_ writing\r\n     combined with orchestration which never overpowers the vocal\r\n     part will be of greater service to the composer, from an\r\n     artistic point of view, than the more elaborate methods of\r\n     Richard Wagner.\r\n\r\n\r\nVoices in combination.\r\n\r\nTreating solo voices in a polyphonico-harmonic manner is the best\r\nmethod of preserving their individual character in _ensembles_. A\r\ndistribution which is wholly harmonic or entirely polyphonic is seldom\r\nfound. The first plan, largely used in choral writing, simplifies the\r\nmovement of the voices too greatly, eliminating their melodic\r\ncharacter; the second method is wearisome and somewhat disturbing to\r\nthe ear.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the voices are arranged according to the law of\r\nnormal register. Crossing of parts is rare and should only be done\r\nwith the intention of emphasising the melody in the ascending voices\r\nabove those adjacent in register, e.g. the tenor part above contralto,\r\nthe mezzo-soprano above the soprano, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuet.\r\n\r\nThe combinations most conducive to the proper movement of parts are\r\nthose of two voices related within an octave 8 [Sopr./Ten.,\r\nM.-sopr./Bar., C.-alto/Bass. Movement in tenths, sixths, thirds or\r\noctaves (the last very seldom) will always produce satisfactory\r\n_ensemble_, and if the parts progress polyphonically, it need not\r\nhappen _frequently_ that they are separated by more than a tenth, or\r\nthat undesirable crossing of parts will result.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[99-101]]--Sopr. and Tenor (cf. Ex. 289, 290).\r\n\r\n_Servilia_ [[143]]--Sopr. and Tenor.\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act I [[48-50]]--Sopr. and Tenor.\r\n\r\n_Kashtche\xc3\xaf the Immortal_ [[62-64]]. Mezzo-sopr. and Baritone.\r\n\r\n=Voices related in fifths and fourths, 5 [Sopr./C.-alto, 4\r\n[C.-alto/Ten., 5 [Ten./Bass.= should progress nearer to one another; it\r\nis rare for them to move in tenths, common in sixths and thirds; they\r\nmay also proceed in unison. The two voices are seldom separated at a\r\ngreater distance than an octave, and certain cases will require\r\ncrossing of parts, which, however, should only be for periods of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[263-264]]--Soprano and Alto.\r\n\r\n* _The Christmas Night_ [[78-80]]--Alto and Tenor.\r\n\r\n* _Legend of Kitesh_ [[338]]--Tenor and Bass.\r\n\r\nVoices related in thirds;\r\n\r\n3 [Sopr.     M.-sopr. Ten.  Bar.\r\n  [M.-sopr., C.-alto, Bass, Bass,\r\n\r\nmay move in unison, in thirds and sixths, and admit very largely of\r\nthe crossing of parts. Separation by more than an octave must only be\r\nmomentary, and is generally to be avoided.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[174]]--Sopr. and Mezzo-sopr.\r\n\r\n* _Tsar Saltan_ [[5-6]]--Sopr. and Mezzo-sopr.\r\n\r\nIn the case of voices related in twelfths: 12 [Sopr./Bass, intervals\r\napproaching one another do not create a good effect, for this\r\ntransplants the deeper voice into the upper register and _vice versa_.\r\nSinging in unison is no longer possible, and thirds are to be avoided;\r\nthe use of sixths, tenths and thirteenths is recommended. The voices\r\nwill often be separated by more than a twelfth and crossing of parts\r\nis out of the question.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\n* _Tsar Saltan_ [[254-255]].\r\n\r\nRelationship in tenths 10 [Sopr./Bar. or M.-sopr./Bass is fairly\r\ncommon. The explanations given above are also applicable in this case.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[291-300]] (cf. extract, Ex. 118) Sopr. and Bar.\r\n\r\nThe use of similar voices in pairs: Sopr./Sopr., Ten./Ten. entails\r\nsinging in unison and thirds. They should rarely be separated beyond a\r\nsixth, but crossing of parts is inevitable, as otherwise the resultant\r\nvolume of tone would be too weak.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ Other possible combinations: C.-alto/Bar.,\r\n     M.-sopr./Ten., call for no special remarks.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n* _The May Night_, Act I pp. 59-64--Mezzo-sopr. and Tenor.\r\n\r\n* _Sadko_ [[322-324]]--Mezzo-sopr. and Tenor.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, writing for two voices is only successful when the\r\nprogression of parts is clear, when discords are prepared by a common\r\nnote, or are the outcome of conveniently separated movement and\r\ncorrectly resolved. Empty intervals of fourths and perfect fifths,\r\nelevenths and twelfths should be avoided on the strong beats of a bar,\r\nespecially on notes of some value. If, however, one of the voices\r\nassumes a melodic character, the other forming the harmonic\r\naccompaniment in declamatory style, it is not absolutely necessary to\r\navoid the intervals mentioned above.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ It is not within the scope of the present work to\r\n     consider the writing of vocal parts in closer detail. This\r\n     question must be left to the professor of free counterpoint.\r\n     It remains to be noted that the human voice accompanied by\r\n     the orchestra is always heard independently as something\r\n     apart, something complete in itself. For this reason a\r\n     composer may never rely on the orchestra to fill up an empty\r\n     space or correct a fault in the handling of voices. All the\r\n     rules of harmony and counterpoint, down to the last detail,\r\n     must be applied to vocal writing, which is never dependent\r\n     upon orchestral accompaniment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrios, quartets etc.\r\n\r\nAll that has been said regarding the relationship of voices in duet\r\napplies with equal force to the combination of three, four, five or\r\nmore voices. An _ensemble_ of several voices is seldom purely\r\npolyphonic; as a rule, although some parts move polyphonically,\r\nprogression in thirds, sixths, tenths and thirteenths is used for the\r\nremainder. Declamation for some voices on notes forming the harmony is\r\nalso possible. This variety of simultaneous movement of vocal parts\r\nrenders the comprehension of the total effect less difficult for the\r\near, and sanctions the distribution of distinctive and suitable\r\nfigures or tone colouring to certain voices with other figures or\r\ntimbres which may be proceeding at the same time. The skilful\r\narrangement of pauses and re-entries facilitates the understanding of\r\nthe whole, and gives desirable prominence to detail.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[267]]--Trio, Finale to Act III.\r\n\r\n_The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[116-118]]--Quartet in Act II.\r\n\r\n  "    "      "    [[168-171]]--Sextet in Act III (cf. extract, Ex. 283).\r\n\r\n_Servilia_ [[149-152]]--Quintet in Act III.\r\n\r\nThe movement of solo voices is seldom purely harmonic in character\r\nwith predominance given to the upper voices homophonically treated.\r\nThe blending of all the parts into an harmonic whole, without any\r\ndistinctive predominant feature in any one part (as in a chorale) is\r\nemployed for songs or _ensembles_ in traditional style, prayers,\r\nhymns, etc. If this method is adopted for the quartet of voices,\r\nSopr./Alto/Ten./Bass, it will be noted that widely-spaced part writing\r\nis the most natural and suitable form (especially in _forte_\r\npassages), as the four voices can sing together in their proper\r\nregisters (low, middle and high), while, in close part writing they\r\nmay find themselves at a given moment in registers, which are entirely\r\nforeign. But both methods should be employed, as, otherwise, it would\r\nbe impossible to guarantee equality in even the shortest succession of\r\nchords.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[178]] Hymn of Tsar Berendey\'s subjects.\r\n\r\nNo. 305. _Legend of Kitesh_ [[341]].\r\n\r\nThe second half of the last example is an instance of six-part\r\nharmonic writing; the upper voice stands out prominently, the rest\r\nform a kind of accompaniment.\r\n\r\n\r\nChorus.\r\n\r\nRange and register.\r\n\r\nThe range of choral voices is slightly more limited than that of\r\nsoloists. The exceptional register may be considered as two notes\r\nabove and below the normal octave. The dotted lines extended still\r\nfurther indicate the limits upon which a composer may rely in very\r\nexceptional cases, as every full chorus must contain a few voices of\r\nmore than average compass, in this respect approaching the solo voice\r\nin character. In many choruses one or two bass singers may be found\r\nwho are able to go still lower than the limit of the exceptional range\r\n(they are called _octavists_).[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Contrebasses_ voices as they are called when mentioned\r\nin French works are peculiar to Russia, in which country they are\r\nplentiful. (Translator\'s note.)]\r\n\r\n     _Note._ These uncommonly deep notes must be moderately well\r\n     sustained and can only be used when the whole chorus is\r\n     singing quite _piano_; they are hardly applicable except in\r\n     unaccompanied choruses (_a cappella_).\r\n\r\nThe difference in range between the "firsts" and "seconds" in each\r\ntype may be fixed as follows: the normal octave and the exceptionally\r\nlow register should be allotted to the "seconds", the same octave and\r\nthe exceptionally high register to the "firsts".\r\n\r\nThe composition of the chorus is approximately as follows: for a full\r\nchorus, 32 singers to each of the 4 parts sopr., alt., ten. and bass;\r\nfor a chorus of medium size, from 16 to 20, and for a small chorus\r\nfrom 8 to 10 singers. The number of women will often predominate, and\r\nmore voices are given to the "firsts" than to the "seconds".\r\n\r\nOn account of stage requirements a chorus may have to be divided into\r\ntwo or even three separate parts. This is a great disadvantage,\r\nespecially with a small chorus, as each chorister becomes more or less\r\na soloist.\r\n\r\nThe methods of writing for operatic chorus are very numerous. Besides\r\nthe primary harmonico-polyphonic arrangement, containing the whole\r\nmusical idea, the voices may be made to enter separately, singing or\r\ndeclaiming phrases of varying length; they may progress in unison or\r\nin octaves; one vocal part may repeat certain notes or the whole\r\nchorus reiterate certain chords; one melodic part may predominate (the\r\nupper part for preference), the others forming an harmonic\r\naccompaniment; isolated exclamatory phrases may be given to the whole\r\nchorus or to certain portions of it, and finally, the entire chorus\r\nmay be treated in a purely harmonic manner in chords, with the\r\nessential melodic design allotted to the orchestra. Having outlined\r\nthe principal methods of handling the chorus, I advise the reader to\r\nstudy vocal and orchestral scores where he will find many\r\nillustrations impossible to deal with here.\r\n\r\nThere exists another most important operation, the division of the\r\nchorus into different groups. The most natural method is to divide it\r\ninto men\'s chorus and women\'s chorus. Less frequent combinations are\r\naltos, tenors and basses, or sopranos, altos and tenors. There remains\r\nyet another point to be considered, the sub-division of each part into\r\ntwo\'s and three\'s. Men\'s and women\'s choruses, considered as distinct\r\nunities may alternate either one with the other, or with the principal\r\nchorus. For this reason sub-division increases the possibilities of\r\nchoral writing, and, as I have already remarked, it is only by the\r\nstudy of choral works that the student will acquire mastery over this\r\nbranch of composition, the fundamental principles of which can only be\r\nfaintly outlined in the course of the present work.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelody.\r\n\r\nMelody is more limited in the chorus than in the solo voice, both as\r\nregards range as well as mobility. Choristers\' voices are less\r\n"settled" and not so highly trained as those of soloists. Sometimes\r\nsolo and choral melody are similar in point of range and technique,\r\nbut more often the latter is lacking in freedom and variety of rhythm,\r\nrestricted as it is to the repetition of short phrases, while the solo\r\nvoice demands broader melodic outline and greater freedom in\r\nconstruction. In this respect choral melody more closely resembles\r\ninstrumental melody. Pauses for taking breath are not so important\r\nwith chorus singers as with soloists; the former do not need to\r\nbreathe all together and each singer may take a slight rest from time\r\nto time, thus obviating the necessity for sudden complete silences.\r\nThe question of suitable vowels is likewise of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nThe change from notes of short value to long, vocalisation on\r\nsyllables and other questions mentioned above are equally applicable\r\nto choral melody, but in a minor degree. Not more than two or three\r\nnotes should be written on one syllable except for fanciful and\r\nwhimsical effects.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\nNo. 306. _The Golden Cockerel_ [[262]]; see also before [[123]].\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Mixed chorus.\r\n\r\nChorus in unison.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and most natural combination of voices is sopranos and\r\naltos, or tenors and basses. These combinations produce ample and\r\nvigourous tone, and the mixed timbres serve to give prominence to a\r\nmelody in the upper or bass parts. In practice the other voices are\r\noften divided to thicken the harmony. The combination of altos and\r\ntenors produces a peculiar mixed tone quality, somewhat _bizarre_ and\r\nseldom used.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[64]].\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[208]] (cf. Ex. 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nProgression in octaves.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and natural combinations are sopranos and tenors 8\r\n[Sopr./Ten., altos and basses 8 [Altos/Basses; they produce a tone\r\nboth brilliant and powerful. Progression of sopranos and altos, or\r\ntenors and basses is seldom practised. Though the latter combinations\r\nmay occur in choruses for women and men alone, they can only be used\r\nin melodies of restricted length. The difference of register in which\r\nthe voices move does not permit of the same balance of tone obtained\r\nby voices of a distinctive kind.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[60]], [[61]]--Carnival Procession.\r\n\r\n       "        [[113]]--Wedding Ceremony.\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[37]]--Chorus of Guests, 1st Tableau.\r\n\r\nDividing kindred voices in octaves is seldom done, 8 [Sopr. I/Sopr. II\r\netc., except perhaps in the basses 8 [Basses I/Basses II, when the\r\nprogression of parts demand it, or it is required to double the bass\r\npart in octaves.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act III [[68]]--Final chorus (cf. Ex. 312).\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[341]]--Final chorus.\r\n\r\nA beautifully round tone results from doubling men\'s and women\'s\r\nvoices in octaves 8 [Sopr. + Altos/Ten. + Basses.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[323]]--Final chorus.\r\n\r\nBrilliance and vigour is achieved when sopranos and altos progress in\r\nthirds doubled in octaves by tenors and basses also in thirds: 8\r\n[Sopr./Altos] 3/[Ten./Basses] 3.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Mlada_, Act I [[24]]; Act II, before [[31]].\r\n\r\n_The Golden Cockerel_ [[235]].\r\n\r\nOn the rare occasions when the whole chorus progresses in double\r\noctaves the usual arrangement is:\r\n\r\nSopr. + Altos]            8 [Sopr.\r\n     8 [Ten. ] 8, or else   [Altos + Ten.  ]\r\n       [Basses                       Basses] 8.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[319]].\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[182]].\r\n\r\n\r\nVoices (_divisi_); harmonic use of the mixed chorus.\r\n\r\nThe purely harmonic progression of a four-part mixed chorus is more\r\nnatural and resonant when the harmony is of the widely divided order,\r\nso that the volume of tone is equally distributed throughout.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\nNo. 307. _Sadko_ [[144]]--Beginning of 3rd tableau.\r\n\r\nTo secure a well-balanced _forte_ chord in close part writing the\r\nfollowing distribution is recommended:\r\n\r\n[Sopr. I\r\n[Sopr. II\r\n\r\n Altos\r\n\r\n[Ten. I\r\n[Ten. II\r\n\r\n[Basses I\r\n[Basses II.\r\n\r\nThree harmonic parts in the high register (2 sopranos and altos) are\r\ndoubled an octave lower by 2 tenors and the 1st basses. The lower\r\npart is undertaken by the 2nd basses. In this manner the tenors\r\nsing in the soprano octave, the 1st basses in the alto octave and\r\nthe 2nd basses are independent.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[327]]--End of the work.\r\n\r\n_Mlada_, Act II [[20]]--Procession of Princes.\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act II [[19]] (cf. Ex. 212).\r\n\r\nDivision of parts can be adopted when one of them is entrusted with a\r\nmelody, the remainder forming a sufficiently full accompaniment. The\r\nchoice of parts to be divided depends upon the range of the upper one.\r\nWhen a harmonic-melodic phrase is repeated in different keys and\r\nregisters, it may be necessary to distribute the parts and divide them\r\nin another manner, so as to maintain proper choral balance. As an\r\nillustration I give two extracts of identical musical context, the\r\nsecond (_F_ major) being a third higher than the first (_D_ major). In\r\nthe first example the altos are added to the sopranos to strengthen\r\nthe melody; the tenors and basses _divisi_ form the harmony. In the\r\nsecond example the melody being a third higher may be given to the\r\nsopranos alone; the altos therefore take part in the harmony, and\r\nconsequently the lower parts are divided in a different way.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[173]] and [[177]] (cf. Ex. 205 and 206); compare also the\r\nsame music in _G_ major [[189]].\r\n\r\nNo. 309-310. _Ivan the Terrible_, Act I [[77]].\r\n\r\nExample 307 is an instance of widely-spaced four-part writing forming\r\nthe harmonic basis, with the melodic idea in the orchestra. In Example\r\n308, the same in musical context, the melodic figure is given to the\r\nsopranos, and among the other parts which form the harmony the tenors\r\nare divided.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\nNo. 308. _Sadko_ [[152]].\r\n\r\nIn polyphonic writing exceeding 4 part harmony the voices should be\r\ndivided so as to obtain the necessary number of actual parts. One part\r\nmay be divided into as many as three different parts, 3 sopranos, 3\r\naltos etc.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\nNo. 312. _Ivan the Terrible_, Act III [[69]]--Final chorus.\r\n\r\n_Servilia_ [[233]]--Final chorus.\r\n\r\n_Mlada_, Act IV [[35-36]]--Final chorus.\r\n\r\nIn _fugato_ writing and fugal imitation for mixed chorus the\r\ndistribution is generally in four parts, but this number may be\r\nincreased for cumulative effects as in the example quoted. In such\r\ncases the composer should be careful as to the arrangement of the\r\nfinal chord, the summit and climax of the passage. After the entry of\r\nthe last of the voices the progression of such a passage should be\r\nhandled with a view to the tone of the final chord. The treatment\r\nshould be such that concords produced by divided voices or different\r\ngroups of voices retain their full value; and if the final chord be a\r\ndiscord its effect may be heightened by means of crossing of parts.\r\nThe reader is advised to examine carefully the progression of parts\r\nleading up to the final chord in each of the examples given above,\r\npaying special attention to the distribution of these final chords.\r\nCrossing of parts must not be effected at random. The arrangement of\r\nchoral parts follows the natural order of register and can only be\r\naltered for short spaces of time to give momentary prominence to some\r\nmelodic or declamatory phrase.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act I [[79]], Act II [[5]], Act III [[67]].\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Men\'s chorus and women\'s chorus.\r\n\r\nIn writing a three-part female chorus the division should be either\r\nSopr. I/Sopr. II/Altos or Sopr./Altos I/Altos II; the same for men:\r\nTen. I/Ten. II/Bass or Ten./Bass I/Bass II. The choice of distribution\r\ndepends upon which voice is to predominate, or the register in which\r\nthe group is to be placed. The manner of dividing the parts may\r\nchange, one following the other at will. In four-part harmonic writing\r\nthe method of division is self-evident:\r\n\r\nSopr. I\r\nSopr. II\r\nAltos I\r\nAltos II\r\n\r\nTen. I\r\nTen. II\r\nBass I\r\nBass II\r\n\r\nTo give prominence to a melody in the middle part in three-part\r\nharmony, the following method may be adopted:\r\n\r\nSopr. I                Ten. I\r\nSopr. II + Altos I, or Ten. II + Bass I.\r\nAltos II               Bass II\r\n\r\nIf, in three-part writing, the melody has to stand out in the upper\r\npart, the harmony may be either widely-divided or close.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act I [[25-26]], [[23-31]] (Women\'s chorus).\r\n\r\n_Sadko_, before [[181]]--Men\'s chorus (cf. Ex. 27).\r\n\r\nNo. 311. _Sadko_ [[270-272]]--Women\'s chorus.\r\n\r\nIn four-part choral writing close harmony is preferable, otherwise the\r\nupper part will be in too high a register and the range of the bottom\r\npart too low.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[17]]--Male chorus.\r\n\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act II [[36-38]]--Female chorus (cf. Ex. 296).\r\n\r\nDistribution in two parts which is generally polyphonic does not call\r\nfor any special remarks; the same may be said of chorus in unison.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[50]]--Male chorus.\r\n\r\n_Mlada_, beginning of Act I.            }\r\n_Ivan the Terrible_, Act III [[13-15]]. } Female chorus.\r\n_Servilia_ [[26]].                      }\r\n\r\nIf male and female choruses are handled in a purely harmonic manner\r\nclose part writing should be adopted. This is the only way to secure\r\nproper balance of tone in chords given to voices of the same kind.\r\nSuccessions of chords in three parts are more frequent than those in\r\nfour; sometimes a series of chords is practicable only in two parts.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[19]]--Chorus of Birds.\r\n\r\n       "        [[281-285]]--Chorus of Flowers (cf. Ex. 26).\r\n\r\nIn _fugato_ writing, and fugal imitation in three parts, allotted to a\r\nchorus composed of voices of one kind, the principal subject is given\r\nto two parts, the counter subject to one; by this method the doubled\r\nthemes will stand out to better advantage.\r\n\r\n_Examples:_\r\n\r\n_Sadko_ [[20-21]].\r\n\r\n* _The Tsar\'s Bride_ [[29-30]].\r\n\r\nMale and female choruses, apart from the part they play as individual\r\nunities, may be introduced as separate groups in mixed choruses\r\nalternating with the whole _ensemble_.\r\n\r\n_Example:_\r\n\r\n_Snegourotchka_ [[198]]--Hymn of Tsar Berendey\'s Subjects (cf. Ex.\r\n166).\r\n\r\nAs a general rule a female chorus does not contain the real harmonic\r\nbass part when this part is situated in the low register, so that no\r\noctaves are formed between the real bass and the lower choral voice.\r\nHarmony in a chorus for women is generally given to the three upper\r\nparts, the lower part acting as accompanying bass. It will be noticed\r\nthat this rule may lead to the employment of chords of the sixth and\r\nempty consecutive fourth\'s and fifth\'s which should be avoided. In\r\nexample No. 311 (_Sadko_ [[270]]), this is remedied by the high\r\nposition of the bass part; later an empty interval (4/5) occurs, but\r\nonly for a moment, and still further on another such interval is\r\navoided by the union of all the voices in the octave (_B/B_). In Ex.\r\nNo. 304 (_Sadko_ [[83]]) the harmonic bass in the low register is\r\ncarefully omitted, but when transferred to the upper register it is\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\nI conclude the present chapter with the following necessary\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n1. The operation of dividing voices undoubtedly weakens their\r\nresonance, and as the reader will have observed, one of the principal\r\nfactors in good orchestration is _equal_ balance of tone in the\r\ndistribution of chords. But in choral writing the question is somewhat\r\ndifferent. The orchestra, even after repeated rehearsal always _plays\r\nfrom music_; the operatic chorus, on the other hand, sings by heart.\r\nThe chorus master can carry out the composer\'s instructions as to the\r\ndivision of parts in one way or another, varying and adjusting the\r\nnumber of singers to each part. By manipulating some shade of\r\nexpression he can maintain a balance of tone between divided and\r\nundivided voices. In orchestral material the composer has to handle a\r\ngreat number of timbres, widely different in character and volume of\r\ntone. In the chorus there are but four qualities. A chorus moving\r\nabout the stage cannot convey varying shades of expression so exactly\r\nas an orchestra seated at the desk. It may therefore be safely assumed\r\nthat a composer is entitled to some licence in the question of\r\ndividing choral parts; dealing with the orchestra involves greater\r\nforesight and care.\r\n\r\n2. In trying to obtain equal balance in writing three-part choruses\r\nfor male or female chorus I have often resorted to the method of\r\ndoubling the middle part as recommended on p. 149. The chorus master\r\nis at liberty to equalise the chorus by transferring voices from one\r\npart to another. In choruses divided into three parts I have noticed\r\nthat chorus masters are in the habit of giving the upper part to Sopr.\r\nI, or Ten. I, and the two lower parts to Sopr. II and Ten. II divided.\r\nI consider this arrangement unsound, as the balance of parts can never\r\nbe equal. The attention of chorus masters is called to the necessity\r\nof strengthening middle parts, for the expedient of giving prominence\r\nto the upper part concerns melody alone and leaves harmony out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n3. Skilful management of choral parts is a fairly safe guarantee of\r\nclear and satisfactory performance. Miscalculations in writing are a\r\ngreat hindrance to study, and the most experienced chorus may come to\r\ngrief through faulty progression of parts. If the progression of parts\r\nis correct, if discords are properly prepared, sudden and remote\r\nmodulations, even of the harshest and most uncommon kind will be\r\ncomparatively simple and may be approached with some degree of\r\nconfidence. This is a fact which composers do not always bear in mind,\r\nbut singers know it well and appreciate its importance to the full. As\r\nan instance I quote the very difficult modulation which occurs in Ex.\r\nNo. 169 (_Sadko_ [[302]]). I doubt whether it could be sung if written\r\nin any other way. Careful endeavour on the part of a composer is\r\nbetter than useless struggle inflicted upon the performer.\r\n\r\nJuly 31st (Aug. 13th) 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Principles\r\nof Orchestration_\r\n\r\n[VOLUME II]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe musical examples in this volume are taken from the composer\'s\r\nfollowing works:\r\n\r\n\r\nW.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
