By the horrors of that trade was I first torn away from\r\nall the tender connexions that were naturally dear to my heart; but\r\nthese, through the mysterious ways of Providence, I ought to regard as\r\ninfinitely more than compensated by the introduction I have thence\r\nobtained to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and of a nation\r\nwhich, by its liberal sentiments, its humanity, the glorious freedom\r\nof its government, and its proficiency in arts and sciences, has\r\nexalted the dignity of human nature.\r\n\r\nI am sensible I ought to entreat your pardon for addressing to you a\r\nwork so wholly devoid of literary merit; but, as the production of an\r\nunlettered African, who is actuated by the hope of becoming an\r\ninstrument towards the relief of his suffering countrymen, I trust\r\nthat _such a man_, pleading in _such a cause_, will be acquitted of\r\nboldness and presumption.\r\n\r\nMay the God of heaven inspire your hearts with peculiar benevolence on\r\nthat important day when the question of Abolition is to be discussed,\r\nwhen thousands, in consequence of your Determination, are to look for\r\nHappiness or Misery!\r\n\r\n                                       I am,\r\n                             My Lords and Gentlemen,\r\n                                       Your most obedient,\r\n                               And devoted humble Servant,\r\n                                       Olaudah Equiano,\r\n                                             or\r\n                                        Gustavus Vassa.\r\n\r\n     Union-Street, Mary-le-bone,\r\n     March 24, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST of SUBSCRIBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.\r\n     His Royal Highness the Duke of York.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A\r\n\r\n     The Right Hon. the Earl of Ailesbury\r\n     Admiral Affleck\r\n     Mr. William Abington, 2 copies\r\n     Mr. John Abraham\r\n     James Adair, Esq.\r\n     Reverend Mr. Aldridge\r\n     Mr. John Almon\r\n     Mrs. Arnot\r\n     Mr. Joseph Armitage\r\n     Mr. Joseph Ashpinshaw\r\n     Mr. Samuel Atkins\r\n     Mr. John Atwood\r\n     Mr. Thomas Atwood\r\n     Mr. Ashwell\r\n     J.C.

It is therefore, I confess, not\r\na little hazardous in a private and obscure individual, and a stranger\r\ntoo, thus to solicit the indulgent attention of the public; especially\r\nwhen I own I offer here the history of neither a saint, a hero, nor a\r\ntyrant. I believe there are few events in my life, which have not\r\nhappened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and,\r\ndid I consider myself an European, I might say my sufferings were\r\ngreat: but when I compare my lot with that of most of my countrymen, I\r\nregard myself as a _particular favourite of Heaven_, and acknowledge\r\nthe mercies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the\r\nfollowing narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage\r\ngeneral attention, let my motive be some excuse for its publication. I\r\nam not so foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or\r\nliterary reputation. If it affords any satisfaction to my numerous\r\nfriends, at whose request it has been written, or in the smallest\r\ndegree promotes the interests of humanity, the ends for which it was\r\nundertaken will be fully attained, and every wish of my heart\r\ngratified. Let it therefore be remembered, that, in wishing to avoid\r\ncensure, I do not aspire to praise.\r\n\r\nThat part of Africa, known by the name of Guinea, to which the trade\r\nfor slaves is carried on, extends along the coast above 3400 miles,\r\nfrom the Senegal to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms. Of\r\nthese the most considerable is the kingdom of Benen, both as to extent\r\nand wealth, the richness and cultivation of the soil, the power of its\r\nking, and the number and warlike disposition of the inhabitants. It is\r\nsituated nearly under the line, and extends along the coast about 170\r\nmiles, but runs back into the interior part of Africa to a distance\r\nhitherto I believe unexplored by any traveller; and seems only\r\nterminated at length by the empire of Abyssinia, near 1500 miles from\r\nits beginning. This kingdom is divided into many provinces or\r\ndistricts: in one of the most remote and fertile of which, called\r\nEboe, I was born, in the year 1745, in a charming fruitful vale, named\r\nEssaka. The distance of this province from the capital of Benin and\r\nthe sea coast must be very considerable; for I had never heard of\r\nwhite men or Europeans, nor of the sea: and our subjection to the king\r\nof Benin was little more than nominal; for every transaction of the\r\ngovernment, as far as my slender observation extended, was conducted\r\nby the chiefs or elders of the place. The manners and government of a\r\npeople who have little commerce with other countries are generally\r\nvery simple; and the history of what passes in one family or village\r\nmay serve as a specimen of a nation. My father was one of those elders\r\nor chiefs I have spoken of, and was styled Embrenche; a term, as I\r\nremember, importing the highest distinction, and signifying in our\r\nlanguage a _mark_ of grandeur. This mark is conferred on the person\r\nentitled to it, by cutting the skin across at the top of the forehead,\r\nand drawing it down to the eye-brows; and while it is in this\r\nsituation applying a warm hand, and rubbing it until it shrinks up\r\ninto a thick _weal_ across the lower part of the forehead. Most of the\r\njudges and senators were thus marked; my father had long born it: I\r\nhad seen it conferred on one of my brothers, and I was also\r\n_destined_ to receive it by my parents. Those Embrence, or chief men,\r\ndecided disputes and punished crimes; for which purpose they always\r\nassembled together. The proceedings were generally short; and in most\r\ncases the law of retaliation prevailed. I remember a man was brought\r\nbefore my father, and the other judges, for kidnapping a boy; and,\r\nalthough he was the son of a chief or senator, he was condemned to\r\nmake recompense by a man or woman slave. Adultery, however, was\r\nsometimes punished with slavery or death; a punishment which I believe\r\nis inflicted on it throughout most of the nations of Africa[A]: so\r\nsacred among them is the honour of the marriage bed, and so jealous\r\nare they of the fidelity of their wives. Of this I recollect an\r\ninstance:--a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and\r\ndelivered over, as the custom was, to her husband to be punished.\r\nAccordingly he determined to put her to death: but it being found,\r\njust before her execution, that she had an infant at her breast; and\r\nno woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nurse, she was\r\nspared on account of the child. The men, however, do not preserve the\r\nsame constancy to their wives, which they expect from them; for they\r\nindulge in a plurality, though seldom in more than two. Their mode of\r\nmarriage is thus:--both parties are usually betrothed when young by\r\ntheir parents, (though I have known the males to betroth themselves).\r\nOn this occasion a feast is prepared, and the bride and bridegroom\r\nstand up in the midst of all their friends, who are assembled for the\r\npurpose, while he declares she is thenceforth to be looked upon as his\r\nwife, and that no other person is to pay any addresses to her. This is\r\nalso immediately proclaimed in the vicinity, on which the bride\r\nretires from the assembly. Some time after she is brought home to her\r\nhusband, and then another feast is made, to which the relations of\r\nboth parties are invited: her parents then deliver her to the\r\nbridegroom, accompanied with a number of blessings, and at the same\r\ntime they tie round her waist a cotton string of the thickness of a\r\ngoose-quill, which none but married women are permitted to wear: she\r\nis now considered as completely his wife; and at this time the dowry\r\nis given to the new married pair, which generally consists of portions\r\nof land, slaves, and cattle, household goods, and implements of\r\nhusbandry. These are offered by the friends of both parties; besides\r\nwhich the parents of the bridegroom present gifts to those of the\r\nbride, whose property she is looked upon before marriage; but after it\r\nshe is esteemed the sole property of her husband. The ceremony being\r\nnow ended the festival begins, which is celebrated with bonefires, and\r\nloud acclamations of joy, accompanied with music and dancing.\r\n\r\nWe are almost a nation of dancers, musicians, and poets. Thus every\r\ngreat event, such as a triumphant return from battle, or other cause\r\nof public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances, which are\r\naccompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion. The assembly\r\nis separated into four divisions, which dance either apart or in\r\nsuccession, and each with a character peculiar to itself. The first\r\ndivision contains the married men, who in their dances frequently\r\nexhibit feats of arms, and the representation of a battle. To these\r\nsucceed the married women, who dance in the second division. The young\r\nmen occupy the third; and the maidens the fourth. Each represents some\r\ninteresting scene of real life, such as a great achievement, domestic\r\nemployment, a pathetic story, or some rural sport; and as the subject\r\nis generally founded on some recent event, it is therefore ever new.\r\nThis gives our dances a spirit and variety which I have scarcely seen\r\nelsewhere[B]. We have many musical instruments, particularly drums of\r\ndifferent kinds, a piece of music which resembles a guitar, and\r\nanother much like a stickado. These last are chiefly used by betrothed\r\nvirgins, who play on them on all grand festivals.\r\n\r\nAs our manners are simple, our luxuries are few. The dress of both\r\nsexes is nearly the same. It generally consists of a long piece of\r\ncallico, or muslin, wrapped loosely round the body, somewhat in the\r\nform of a highland plaid. This is usually dyed blue, which is our\r\nfavourite colour. It is extracted from a berry, and is brighter and\r\nricher than any I have seen in Europe. Besides this, our women of\r\ndistinction wear golden ornaments; which they dispose with some\r\nprofusion on their arms and legs. When our women are not employed with\r\nthe men in tillage, their usual occupation is spinning and weaving\r\ncotton, which they afterwards dye, and make it into garments. They\r\nalso manufacture earthen vessels, of which we have many kinds. Among\r\nthe rest tobacco pipes, made after the same fashion, and used in the\r\nsame manner, as those in Turkey[C].\r\n\r\nOur manner of living is entirely plain; for as yet the natives are\r\nunacquainted with those refinements in cookery which debauch the\r\ntaste: bullocks, goats, and poultry, supply the greatest part of their\r\nfood. These constitute likewise the principal wealth of the country,\r\nand the chief articles of its commerce. The flesh is usually stewed in\r\na pan; to make it savoury we sometimes use also pepper, and other\r\nspices, and we have salt made of wood ashes. Our vegetables are mostly\r\nplantains, eadas, yams, beans, and Indian corn. The head of the family\r\nusually eats alone; his wives and slaves have also their separate\r\ntables. Before we taste food we always wash our hands: indeed our\r\ncleanliness on all occasions is extreme; but on this it is an\r\nindispensable ceremony. After washing, libation is made, by pouring\r\nout a small portion of the food, in a certain place, for the spirits\r\nof departed relations, which the natives suppose to preside over their\r\nconduct, and guard them from evil. They are totally unacquainted with\r\nstrong or spirituous liquours; and their principal beverage is palm\r\nwine. This is gotten from a tree of that name by tapping it at the\r\ntop, and fastening a large gourd to it; and sometimes one tree will\r\nyield three or four gallons in a night. When just drawn it is of a\r\nmost delicious sweetness; but in a few days it acquires a tartish and\r\nmore spirituous flavour: though I never saw any one intoxicated by it.\r\nThe same tree also produces nuts and oil. Our principal luxury is in\r\nperfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious\r\nfragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown\r\ninto the fire diffuses a most powerful odour[D]. We beat this wood\r\ninto powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women\r\nperfume themselves.\r\n\r\nIn our buildings we study convenience rather than ornament. Each\r\nmaster of a family has a large square piece of ground, surrounded with\r\na moat or fence, or enclosed with a wall made of red earth tempered;\r\nwhich, when dry, is as hard as brick. Within this are his houses to\r\naccommodate his family and slaves; which, if numerous, frequently\r\npresent the appearance of a village. In the middle stands the\r\nprincipal building, appropriated to the sole use of the master, and\r\nconsisting of two apartments; in one of which he sits in the day with\r\nhis family, the other is left apart for the reception of his friends.\r\nHe has besides these a distinct apartment in which he sleeps, together\r\nwith his male children. On each side are the apartments of his wives,\r\nwho have also their separate day and night houses. The habitations of\r\nthe slaves and their families are distributed throughout the rest of\r\nthe enclosure. These houses never exceed one story in height: they are\r\nalways built of wood, or stakes driven into the ground, crossed with\r\nwattles, and neatly plastered within, and without. The roof is\r\nthatched with reeds. Our day-houses are left open at the sides; but\r\nthose in which we sleep are always covered, and plastered in the\r\ninside, with a composition mixed with cow-dung, to keep off the\r\ndifferent insects, which annoy us during the night. The walls and\r\nfloors also of these are generally covered with mats. Our beds consist\r\nof a platform, raised three or four feet from the ground, on which are\r\nlaid skins, and different parts of a spungy tree called plaintain. Our\r\ncovering is calico or muslin, the same as our dress. The usual seats\r\nare a few logs of wood; but we have benches, which are generally\r\nperfumed, to accommodate strangers: these compose the greater part of\r\nour household furniture. Houses so constructed and furnished require\r\nbut little skill to erect them. Every man is a sufficient architect\r\nfor the purpose. The whole neighbourhood afford their unanimous\r\nassistance in building them and in return receive, and expect no other\r\nrecompense than a feast.\r\n\r\nAs we live in a country where nature is prodigal of her favours, our\r\nwants are few and easily supplied; of course we have few manufactures.\r\nThey consist for the most part of calicoes, earthern ware, ornaments,\r\nand instruments of war and husbandry. But these make no part of our\r\ncommerce, the principal articles of which, as I have observed, are\r\nprovisions. In such a state money is of little use; however we have\r\nsome small pieces of coin, if I may call them such. They are made\r\nsomething like an anchor; but I do not remember either their value or\r\ndenomination. We have also markets, at which I have been frequently\r\nwith my mother. These are sometimes visited by stout mahogany-coloured\r\nmen from the south west of us: we call them Oye-Eboe, which term\r\nsignifies red men living at a distance. They generally bring us\r\nfire-arms, gunpowder, hats, beads, and dried fish. The last we\r\nesteemed a great rarity, as our waters were only brooks and springs.\r\nThese articles they barter with us for odoriferous woods and earth,\r\nand our salt of wood ashes. They always carry slaves through our land;\r\nbut the strictest account is exacted of their manner of procuring them\r\nbefore they are suffered to pass. Sometimes indeed we sold slaves to\r\nthem, but they were only prisoners of war, or such among us as had\r\nbeen convicted of kidnapping, or adultery, and some other crimes,\r\nwhich we esteemed heinous. This practice of kidnapping induces me to\r\nthink, that, notwithstanding all our strictness, their principal\r\nbusiness among us was to trepan our people. I remember too they\r\ncarried great sacks along with them, which not long after I had an\r\nopportunity of fatally seeing applied to that infamous purpose.\r\n\r\nOur land is uncommonly rich and fruitful, and produces all kinds of\r\nvegetables in great abundance. We have plenty of Indian corn, and vast\r\nquantities of cotton and tobacco. Our pine apples grow without\r\nculture; they are about the size of the largest sugar-loaf, and finely\r\nflavoured. We have also spices of different kinds, particularly\r\npepper; and a variety of delicious fruits which I have never seen in\r\nEurope; together with gums of various kinds, and honey in abundance.\r\nAll our industry is exerted to improve those blessings of nature.\r\nAgriculture is our chief employment; and every one, even the children\r\nand women, are engaged in it. Thus we are all habituated to labour\r\nfrom our earliest years. Every one contributes something to the common\r\nstock; and as we are unacquainted with idleness, we have no beggars.\r\nThe benefits of such a mode of living are obvious. The West India\r\nplanters prefer the slaves of Benin or Eboe to those of any other part\r\nof Guinea, for their hardiness, intelligence, integrity, and zeal.\r\nThose benefits are felt by us in the general healthiness of the\r\npeople, and in their vigour and activity; I might have added too in\r\ntheir comeliness. Deformity is indeed unknown amongst us, I mean that\r\nof shape. Numbers of the natives of Eboe now in London might be\r\nbrought in support of this assertion: for, in regard to complexion,\r\nideas of beauty are wholly relative. I remember while in Africa to\r\nhave seen three negro children, who were tawny, and another quite\r\nwhite, who were universally regarded by myself, and the natives in\r\ngeneral, as far as related to their complexions, as deformed. Our\r\nwomen too were in my eyes at least uncommonly graceful, alert, and\r\nmodest to a degree of bashfulness; nor do I remember to have ever\r\nheard of an instance of incontinence amongst them before marriage.\r\nThey are also remarkably cheerful. Indeed cheerfulness and affability\r\nare two of the leading characteristics of our nation.\r\n\r\nOur tillage is exercised in a large plain or common, some hours walk\r\nfrom our dwellings, and all the neighbours resort thither in a body.\r\nThey use no beasts of husbandry; and their only instruments are hoes,\r\naxes, shovels, and beaks, or pointed iron to dig with. Sometimes we\r\nare visited by locusts, which come in large clouds, so as to darken\r\nthe air, and destroy our harvest. This however happens rarely, but\r\nwhen it does, a famine is produced by it. I remember an instance or\r\ntwo wherein this happened. This common is often the theatre of war;\r\nand therefore when our people go out to till their land, they not only\r\ngo in a body, but generally take their arms with them for fear of a\r\nsurprise; and when they apprehend an invasion they guard the avenues\r\nto their dwellings, by driving sticks into the ground, which are so\r\nsharp at one end as to pierce the foot, and are generally dipt in\r\npoison. From what I can recollect of these battles, they appear to\r\nhave been irruptions of one little state or district on the other, to\r\nobtain prisoners or booty. Perhaps they were incited to this by those\r\ntraders who brought the European goods I mentioned amongst us. Such a\r\nmode of obtaining slaves in Africa is common; and I believe more are\r\nprocured this way, and by kidnapping, than any other[E]. When a trader\r\nwants slaves, he applies to a chief for them, and tempts him with his\r\nwares. It is not extraordinary, if on this occasion he yields to the\r\ntemptation with as little firmness, and accepts the price of his\r\nfellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlightened\r\nmerchant. Accordingly he falls on his neighbours, and a desperate\r\nbattle ensues. If he prevails and takes prisoners, he gratifies his\r\navarice by selling them; but, if his party be vanquished, and he falls\r\ninto the hands of the enemy, he is put to death: for, as he has been\r\nknown to foment their quarrels, it is thought dangerous to let him\r\nsurvive, and no ransom can save him, though all other prisoners may be\r\nredeemed. We have fire-arms, bows and arrows, broad two-edged swords\r\nand javelins: we have shields also which cover a man from head to\r\nfoot. All are taught the use of these weapons; even our women are\r\nwarriors, and march boldly out to fight along with the men. Our whole\r\ndistrict is a kind of militia: on a certain signal given, such as the\r\nfiring of a gun at night, they all rise in arms and rush upon their\r\nenemy. It is perhaps something remarkable, that when our people march\r\nto the field a red flag or banner is borne before them. I was once a\r\nwitness to a battle in our common. We had been all at work in it one\r\nday as usual, when our people were suddenly attacked. I climbed a tree\r\nat some distance, from which I beheld the fight. There were many women\r\nas well as men on both sides; among others my mother was there, and\r\narmed with a broad sword. After fighting for a considerable time with\r\ngreat fury, and after many had been killed our people obtained the\r\nvictory, and took their enemy\'s Chief prisoner. He was carried off in\r\ngreat triumph, and, though he offered a large ransom for his life, he\r\nwas put to death. A virgin of note among our enemies had been slain in\r\nthe battle, and her arm was exposed in our market-place, where our\r\ntrophies were always exhibited. The spoils were divided according to\r\nthe merit of the warriors. Those prisoners which were not sold or\r\nredeemed we kept as slaves: but how different was their condition from\r\nthat of the slaves in the West Indies! With us they do no more work\r\nthan other members of the community, even their masters; their food,\r\nclothing and lodging were nearly the same as theirs, (except that they\r\nwere not permitted to eat with those who were free-born); and there\r\nwas scarce any other difference between them, than a superior degree\r\nof importance which the head of a family possesses in our state, and\r\nthat authority which, as such, he exercises over every part of his\r\nhousehold. Some of these slaves have even slaves under them as their\r\nown property, and for their own use.\r\n\r\nAs to religion, the natives believe that there is one Creator of all\r\nthings, and that he lives in the sun, and is girted round with a belt\r\nthat he may never eat or drink; but, according to some, he smokes a\r\npipe, which is our own favourite luxury. They believe he governs\r\nevents, especially our deaths or captivity; but, as for the doctrine\r\nof eternity, I do not remember to have ever heard of it: some however\r\nbelieve in the transmigration of souls in a certain degree. Those\r\nspirits, which are not transmigrated, such as our dear friends or\r\nrelations, they believe always attend them, and guard them from the\r\nbad spirits or their foes. For this reason they always before eating,\r\nas I have observed, put some small portion of the meat, and pour some\r\nof their drink, on the ground for them; and they often make oblations\r\nof the blood of beasts or fowls at their graves. I was very fond of my\r\nmother, and almost constantly with her. When she went to make these\r\noblations at her mother\'s tomb, which was a kind of small solitary\r\nthatched house, I sometimes attended her. There she made her\r\nlibations, and spent most of the night in cries and lamentations. I\r\nhave been often extremely terrified on these occasions. The loneliness\r\nof the place, the darkness of the night, and the ceremony of libation,\r\nnaturally awful and gloomy, were heightened by my mother\'s\r\nlamentations; and these, concuring with the cries of doleful birds, by\r\nwhich these places were frequented, gave an inexpressible terror to\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nWe compute the year from the day on which the sun crosses the line,\r\nand on its setting that evening there is a general shout throughout\r\nthe land; at least I can speak from my own knowledge throughout our\r\nvicinity. The people at the same time make a great noise with rattles,\r\nnot unlike the basket rattles used by children here, though much\r\nlarger, and hold up their hands to heaven for a blessing. It is then\r\nthe greatest offerings are made; and those children whom our wise men\r\nforetel will be fortunate are then presented to different people. I\r\nremember many used to come to see me, and I was carried about to\r\nothers for that purpose. They have many offerings, particularly at\r\nfull moons; generally two at harvest before the fruits are taken out\r\nof the ground: and when any young animals are killed, sometimes they\r\noffer up part of them as a sacrifice. These offerings, when made by\r\none of the heads of a family, serve for the whole. I remember we often\r\nhad them at my father\'s and my uncle\'s, and their families have been\r\npresent. Some of our offerings are eaten with bitter herbs. We had a\r\nsaying among us to any one of a cross temper, \'That if they were to be\r\neaten, they should be eaten with bitter herbs.\'\r\n\r\nWe practised circumcision like the Jews, and made offerings and feasts\r\non that occasion in the same manner as they did. Like them also, our\r\nchildren were named from some event, some circumstance, or fancied\r\nforeboding at the time of their birth. I was named _Olaudah_, which,\r\nin our language, signifies vicissitude or fortune also, one favoured,\r\nand having a loud voice and well spoken. I remember we never polluted\r\nthe name of the object of our adoration; on the contrary, it was\r\nalways mentioned with the greatest reverence; and we were totally\r\nunacquainted with swearing, and all those terms of abuse and reproach\r\nwhich find their way so readily and copiously into the languages of\r\nmore civilized people. The only expressions of that kind I remember\r\nwere \'May you rot, or may you swell, or may a beast take you.\'\r\n\r\nI have before remarked that the natives of this part of Africa are\r\nextremely cleanly. This necessary habit of decency was with us a part\r\nof religion, and therefore we had many purifications and washings;\r\nindeed almost as many, and used on the same occasions, if my\r\nrecollection does not fail me, as the Jews. Those that touched the\r\ndead at any time were obliged to wash and purify themselves before\r\nthey could enter a dwelling-house. Every woman too, at certain times,\r\nwas forbidden to come into a dwelling-house, or touch any person, or\r\nany thing we ate. I was so fond of my mother I could not keep from\r\nher, or avoid touching her at some of those periods, in consequence of\r\nwhich I was obliged to be kept out with her, in a little house made\r\nfor that purpose, till offering was made, and then we were purified.\r\n\r\nThough we had no places of public worship, we had priests and\r\nmagicians, or wise men. I do not remember whether they had different\r\noffices, or whether they were united in the same persons, but they\r\nwere held in great reverence by the people. They calculated our time,\r\nand foretold events, as their name imported, for we called them\r\nAh-affoe-way-cah, which signifies calculators or yearly men, our year\r\nbeing called Ah-affoe. They wore their beards, and when they died they\r\nwere succeeded by their sons. Most of their implements and things of\r\nvalue were interred along with them. Pipes and tobacco were also put\r\ninto the grave with the corpse, which was always perfumed and\r\nornamented, and animals were offered in sacrifice to them. None\r\naccompanied their funerals but those of the same profession or tribe.\r\nThese buried them after sunset, and always returned from the grave by\r\na different way from that which they went.\r\n\r\nThese magicians were also our doctors or physicians. They practised\r\nbleeding by cupping; and were very successful in healing wounds and\r\nexpelling poisons. They had likewise some extraordinary method of\r\ndiscovering jealousy, theft, and poisoning; the success of which no\r\ndoubt they derived from their unbounded influence over the credulity\r\nand superstition of the people. I do not remember what those methods\r\nwere, except that as to poisoning: I recollect an instance or two,\r\nwhich I hope it will not be deemed impertinent here to insert, as it\r\nmay serve as a kind of specimen of the rest, and is still used by the\r\nnegroes in the West Indies. A virgin had been poisoned, but it was not\r\nknown by whom: the doctors ordered the corpse to be taken up by some\r\npersons, and carried to the grave. As soon as the bearers had raised\r\nit on their shoulders, they seemed seized with some[F] sudden\r\nimpulse, and ran to and fro unable to stop themselves. At last, after\r\nhaving passed through a number of thorns and prickly bushes unhurt,\r\nthe corpse fell from them close to a house, and defaced it in the\r\nfall; and, the owner being taken up, he immediately confessed the\r\npoisoning[G].\r\n\r\nThe natives are extremely cautious about poison. When they buy any\r\neatable the seller kisses it all round before the buyer, to shew him\r\nit is not poisoned; and the same is done when any meat or drink is\r\npresented, particularly to a stranger. We have serpents of different\r\nkinds, some of which are esteemed ominous when they appear in our\r\nhouses, and these we never molest. I remember two of those ominous\r\nsnakes, each of which was as thick as the calf of a man\'s leg, and in\r\ncolour resembling a dolphin in the water, crept at different times\r\ninto my mother\'s night-house, where I always lay with her, and coiled\r\nthemselves into folds, and each time they crowed like a cock. I was\r\ndesired by some of our wise men to touch these, that I might be\r\ninterested in the good omens, which I did, for they were quite\r\nharmless, and would tamely suffer themselves to be handled; and then\r\nthey were put into a large open earthen pan, and set on one side of\r\nthe highway. Some of our snakes, however, were poisonous: one of them\r\ncrossed the road one day when I was standing on it, and passed between\r\nmy feet without offering to touch me, to the great surprise of many\r\nwho saw it; and these incidents were accounted by the wise men, and\r\ntherefore by my mother and the rest of the people, as remarkable omens\r\nin my favour.\r\n\r\nSuch is the imperfect sketch my memory has furnished me with of the\r\nmanners and customs of a people among whom I first drew my breath. And\r\nhere I cannot forbear suggesting what has long struck me very\r\nforcibly, namely, the strong analogy which even by this sketch,\r\nimperfect as it is, appears to prevail in the manners and customs of\r\nmy countrymen and those of the Jews, before they reached the Land of\r\nPromise, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that\r\npastoral state which is described in Genesis--an analogy, which alone\r\nwould induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the\r\nother. Indeed this is the opinion of Dr. Gill, who, in his commentary\r\non Genesis, very ably deduces the pedigree of the Africans from Afer\r\nand Afra, the descendants of Abraham by Keturah his wife and concubine\r\n(for both these titles are applied to her). It is also conformable to\r\nthe sentiments of Dr. John Clarke, formerly Dean of Sarum, in his\r\nTruth of the Christian Religion: both these authors concur in\r\nascribing to us this original. The reasonings of these gentlemen are\r\nstill further confirmed by the scripture chronology; and if any\r\nfurther corroboration were required, this resemblance in so many\r\nrespects is a strong evidence in support of the opinion. Like the\r\nIsraelites in their primitive state, our government was conducted by\r\nour chiefs or judges, our wise men and elders; and the head of a\r\nfamily with us enjoyed a similar authority over his household with\r\nthat which is ascribed to Abraham and the other patriarchs. The law of\r\nretaliation obtained almost universally with us as with them: and even\r\ntheir religion appeared to have shed upon us a ray of its glory,\r\nthough broken and spent in its passage, or eclipsed by the cloud with\r\nwhich time, tradition, and ignorance might have enveloped it; for we\r\nhad our circumcision (a rule I believe peculiar to that people:) we\r\nhad also our sacrifices and burnt-offerings, our washings and\r\npurifications, on the same occasions as they had.\r\n\r\nAs to the difference of colour between the Eboan Africans and the\r\nmodern Jews, I shall not presume to account for it. It is a subject\r\nwhich has engaged the pens of men of both genius and learning, and is\r\nfar above my strength. The most able and Reverend Mr. T. Clarkson,\r\nhowever, in his much admired Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the\r\nHuman Species, has ascertained the cause, in a manner that at once\r\nsolves every objection on that account, and, on my mind at least, has\r\nproduced the fullest conviction. I shall therefore refer to that\r\nperformance for the theory[H], contenting myself with extracting a\r\nfact as related by Dr. Mitchel[I]. "The Spaniards, who have inhabited\r\nAmerica, under the torrid zone, for any time, are become as dark\r\ncoloured as our native Indians of Virginia; of which _I myself have\r\nbeen a witness_." There is also another instance[J] of a Portuguese\r\nsettlement at Mitomba, a river in Sierra Leona; where the inhabitants\r\nare bred from a mixture of the first Portuguese discoverers with the\r\nnatives, and are now become in their complexion, and in the woolly\r\nquality of their hair, _perfect negroes_, retaining however a\r\nsmattering of the Portuguese language.\r\n\r\nThese instances, and a great many more which might be adduced, while\r\nthey shew how the complexions of the same persons vary in different\r\nclimates, it is hoped may tend also to remove the prejudice that some\r\nconceive against the natives of Africa on account of their colour.\r\nSurely the minds of the Spaniards did not change with their\r\ncomplexions! Are there not causes enough to which the apparent\r\ninferiority of an African may be ascribed, without limiting the\r\ngoodness of God, and supposing he forbore to stamp understanding on\r\ncertainly his own image, because "carved in ebony." Might it not\r\nnaturally be ascribed to their situation? When they come among\r\nEuropeans, they are ignorant of their language, religion, manners, and\r\ncustoms. Are any pains taken to teach them these? Are they treated as\r\nmen? Does not slavery itself depress the mind, and extinguish all its\r\nfire and every noble sentiment? But, above all, what advantages do not\r\na refined people possess over those who are rude and uncultivated. Let\r\nthe polished and haughty European recollect that his ancestors were\r\nonce, like the Africans, uncivilized, and even barbarous. Did Nature\r\nmake _them_ inferior to their sons? and should _they too_ have been\r\nmade slaves? Every rational mind answers, No. Let such reflections as\r\nthese melt the pride of their superiority into sympathy for the wants\r\nand miseries of their sable brethren, and compel them to acknowledge,\r\nthat understanding is not confined to feature or colour. If, when they\r\nlook round the world, they feel exultation, let it be tempered with\r\nbenevolence to others, and gratitude to God, "who hath made of one\r\nblood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth[K];\r\nand whose wisdom is not our wisdom, neither are our ways his ways."\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: See Benezet\'s "Account of Guinea" throughout.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: When I was in Smyrna I have frequently seen the Greeks\r\ndance after this manner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: The bowl is earthen, curiously figured, to which a long\r\nreed is fixed as a tube.

The coffin then immediately fell from their shoulders against\r\nthe hut, and damaged part of the wall.

They had been implanted in me with great\r\ncare, and made an impression on my mind, which time could not erase,\r\nand which all the adversity and variety of fortune I have since\r\nexperienced served only to rivet and record; for, whether the love of\r\none\'s country be real or imaginary, or a lesson of reason, or an\r\ninstinct of nature, I still look back with pleasure on the first\r\nscenes of my life, though that pleasure has been for the most part\r\nmingled with sorrow.\r\n\r\nI have already acquainted the reader with the time and place of my\r\nbirth. My father, besides many slaves, had a numerous family, of which\r\nseven lived to grow up, including myself and a sister, who was the\r\nonly daughter. As I was the youngest of the sons, I became, of course,\r\nthe greatest favourite with my mother, and was always with her; and\r\nshe used to take particular pains to form my mind. I was trained up\r\nfrom my earliest years in the art of war; my daily exercise was\r\nshooting and throwing javelins; and my mother adorned me with emblems,\r\nafter the manner of our greatest warriors. In this way I grew up till\r\nI was turned the age of eleven, when an end was put to my happiness in\r\nthe following manner:--Generally when the grown people in the\r\nneighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour, the children\r\nassembled together in some of the neighbours\' premises to play; and\r\ncommonly some of us used to get up a tree to look out for any\r\nassailant, or kidnapper, that might come upon us; for they sometimes\r\ntook those opportunities of our parents\' absence to attack and carry\r\noff as many as they could seize. One day, as I was watching at the top\r\nof a tree in our yard, I saw one of those people come into the yard of\r\nour next neighbour but one, to kidnap, there being many stout young\r\npeople in it. Immediately on this I gave the alarm of the rogue, and\r\nhe was surrounded by the stoutest of them, who entangled him with\r\ncords, so that he could not escape till some of the grown people came\r\nand secured him. But alas! ere long it was my fate to be thus\r\nattacked, and to be carried off, when none of the grown people were\r\nnigh. One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as\r\nusual, and only I and my dear sister were left to mind the house, two\r\nmen and a woman got over our walls, and in a moment seized us both,\r\nand, without giving us time to cry out, or make resistance, they\r\nstopped our mouths, and ran off with us into the nearest wood. Here\r\nthey tied our hands, and continued to carry us as far as they could,\r\ntill night came on, when we reached a small house, where the robbers\r\nhalted for refreshment, and spent the night. We were then unbound, but\r\nwere unable to take any food; and, being quite overpowered by fatigue\r\nand grief, our only relief was some sleep, which allayed our\r\nmisfortune for a short time. The next morning we left the house, and\r\ncontinued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept the\r\nwoods, but at last we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had\r\nnow some hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little\r\nway before I discovered some people at a distance, on which I began to\r\ncry out for their assistance: but my cries had no other effect than to\r\nmake them tie me faster and stop my mouth, and then they put me into a\r\nlarge sack. They also stopped my sister\'s mouth, and tied her hands;\r\nand in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the sight of these\r\npeople. When we went to rest the following night they offered us some\r\nvictuals; but we refused it; and the only comfort we had was in being\r\nin one another\'s arms all that night, and bathing each other with our\r\ntears. But alas! we were soon deprived of even the small comfort of\r\nweeping together. The next day proved a day of greater sorrow than I\r\nhad yet experienced; for my sister and I were then separated, while we\r\nlay clasped in each other\'s arms. It was in vain that we besought them\r\nnot to part us; she was torn from me, and immediately carried away,\r\nwhile I was left in a state of distraction not to be described. I\r\ncried and grieved continually; and for several days I did not eat any\r\nthing but what they forced into my mouth. At length, after many days\r\ntravelling, during which I had often changed masters, I got into the\r\nhands of a chieftain, in a very pleasant country. This man had two\r\nwives and some children, and they all used me extremely well, and did\r\nall they could to comfort me; particularly the first wife, who was\r\nsomething like my mother. Although I was a great many days journey\r\nfrom my father\'s house, yet these people spoke exactly the same\r\nlanguage with us. This first master of mine, as I may call him, was a\r\nsmith, and my principal employment was working his bellows, which were\r\nthe same kind as I had seen in my vicinity. They were in some respects\r\nnot unlike the stoves here in gentlemen\'s kitchens; and were covered\r\nover with leather; and in the middle of that leather a stick was\r\nfixed, and a person stood up, and worked it, in the same manner as is\r\ndone to pump water out of a cask with a hand pump. I believe it was\r\ngold he worked, for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour, and was\r\nworn by the women on their wrists and ancles. I was there I suppose\r\nabout a month, and they at last used to trust me some little distance\r\nfrom the house. This liberty I used in embracing every opportunity to\r\ninquire the way to my own home: and I also sometimes, for the same\r\npurpose, went with the maidens, in the cool of the evenings, to bring\r\npitchers of water from the springs for the use of the house. I had\r\nalso remarked where the sun rose in the morning, and set in the\r\nevening, as I had travelled along; and I had observed that my father\'s\r\nhouse was towards the rising of the sun. I therefore determined to\r\nseize the first opportunity of making my escape, and to shape my\r\ncourse for that quarter; for I was quite oppressed and weighed down by\r\ngrief after my mother and friends; and my love of liberty, ever great,\r\nwas strengthened by the mortifying circumstance of not daring to eat\r\nwith the free-born children, although I was mostly their companion.\r\nWhile I was projecting my escape, one day an unlucky event happened,\r\nwhich quite disconcerted my plan, and put an end to my hopes. I used\r\nto be sometimes employed in assisting an elderly woman slave to cook\r\nand take care of the poultry; and one morning, while I was feeding\r\nsome chickens, I happened to toss a small pebble at one of them,\r\nwhich hit it on the middle and directly killed it. The old slave,\r\nhaving soon after missed the chicken, inquired after it; and on my\r\nrelating the accident (for I told her the truth, because my mother\r\nwould never suffer me to tell a lie) she flew into a violent passion,\r\nthreatened that I should suffer for it; and, my master being out, she\r\nimmediately went and told her mistress what I had done. This alarmed\r\nme very much, and I expected an instant flogging, which to me was\r\nuncommonly dreadful; for I had seldom been beaten at home. I therefore\r\nresolved to fly; and accordingly I ran into a thicket that was hard\r\nby, and hid myself in the bushes. Soon afterwards my mistress and the\r\nslave returned, and, not seeing me, they searched all the house, but\r\nnot finding me, and I not making answer when they called to me, they\r\nthought I had run away, and the whole neighbourhood was raised in the\r\npursuit of me. In that part of the country (as in ours) the houses and\r\nvillages were skirted with woods, or shrubberies, and the bushes were\r\nso thick that a man could readily conceal himself in them, so as to\r\nelude the strictest search. The neighbours continued the whole day\r\nlooking for me, and several times many of them came within a few yards\r\nof the place where I lay hid. I then gave myself up for lost entirely,\r\nand expected every moment, when I heard a rustling among the trees, to\r\nbe found out, and punished by my master: but they never discovered me,\r\nthough they were often so near that I even heard their conjectures as\r\nthey were looking about for me; and I now learned from them, that any\r\nattempt to return home would be hopeless. Most of them supposed I had\r\nfled towards home; but the distance was so great, and the way so\r\nintricate, that they thought I could never reach it, and that I should\r\nbe lost in the woods. When I heard this I was seized with a violent\r\npanic, and abandoned myself to despair. Night too began to approach,\r\nand aggravated all my fears. I had before entertained hopes of getting\r\nhome, and I had determined when it should be dark to make the attempt;\r\nbut I was now convinced it was fruitless, and I began to consider\r\nthat, if possibly I could escape all other animals, I could not those\r\nof the human kind; and that, not knowing the way, I must perish in the\r\nwoods. Thus was I like the hunted deer:\r\n\r\n    --"Ev\'ry leaf and ev\'ry whisp\'ring breath\r\n    Convey\'d a foe, and ev\'ry foe a death."\r\n\r\nI heard frequent rustlings among the leaves; and being pretty sure\r\nthey were snakes I expected every instant to be stung by them. This\r\nincreased my anguish, and the horror of my situation became now quite\r\ninsupportable. I at length quitted the thicket, very faint and hungry,\r\nfor I had not eaten or drank any thing all the day; and crept to my\r\nmaster\'s kitchen, from whence I set out at first, and which was an\r\nopen shed, and laid myself down in the ashes with an anxious wish for\r\ndeath to relieve me from all my pains. I was scarcely awake in the\r\nmorning when the old woman slave, who was the first up, came to light\r\nthe fire, and saw me in the fire place. She was very much surprised to\r\nsee me, and could scarcely believe her own eyes. She now promised to\r\nintercede for me, and went for her master, who soon after came, and,\r\nhaving slightly reprimanded me, ordered me to be taken care of, and\r\nnot to be ill-treated.\r\n\r\nSoon after this my master\'s only daughter, and child by his first\r\nwife, sickened and died, which affected him so much that for some time\r\nhe was almost frantic, and really would have killed himself, had he\r\nnot been watched and prevented. However, in a small time afterwards he\r\nrecovered, and I was again sold. I was now carried to the left of the\r\nsun\'s rising, through many different countries, and a number of large\r\nwoods. The people I was sold to used to carry me very often, when I\r\nwas tired, either on their shoulders or on their backs. I saw many\r\nconvenient well-built sheds along the roads, at proper distances, to\r\naccommodate the merchants and travellers, who lay in those buildings\r\nalong with their wives, who often accompany them; and they always go\r\nwell armed.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I left my own nation I always found somebody that\r\nunderstood me till I came to the sea coast. The languages of different\r\nnations did not totally differ, nor were they so copious as those of\r\nthe Europeans, particularly the English. They were therefore easily\r\nlearned; and, while I was journeying thus through Africa, I acquired\r\ntwo or three different tongues. In this manner I had been travelling\r\nfor a considerable time, when one evening, to my great surprise, whom\r\nshould I see brought to the house where I was but my dear sister! As\r\nsoon as she saw me she gave a loud shriek, and ran into my arms--I was\r\nquite overpowered: neither of us could speak; but, for a considerable\r\ntime, clung to each other in mutual embraces, unable to do any thing\r\nbut weep. Our meeting affected all who saw us; and indeed I must\r\nacknowledge, in honour of those sable destroyers of human rights, that\r\nI never met with any ill treatment, or saw any offered to their\r\nslaves, except tying them, when necessary, to keep them from running\r\naway. When these people knew we were brother and sister they indulged\r\nus together; and the man, to whom I supposed we belonged, lay with us,\r\nhe in the middle, while she and I held one another by the hands across\r\nhis breast all night; and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes\r\nin the joy of being together: but even this small comfort was soon to\r\nhave an end; for scarcely had the fatal morning appeared, when she was\r\nagain torn from me for ever! I was now more miserable, if possible,\r\nthan before. The small relief which her presence gave me from pain was\r\ngone, and the wretchedness of my situation was redoubled by my anxiety\r\nafter her fate, and my apprehensions lest her sufferings should be\r\ngreater than mine, when I could not be with her to alleviate them.\r\nYes, thou dear partner of all my childish sports! thou sharer of my\r\njoys and sorrows! happy should I have ever esteemed myself to\r\nencounter every misery for you, and to procure your freedom by the\r\nsacrifice of my own. Though you were early forced from my arms, your\r\nimage has been always rivetted in my heart, from which neither _time\r\nnor fortune_ have been able to remove it; so that, while the thoughts\r\nof your sufferings have damped my prosperity, they have mingled with\r\nadversity and increased its bitterness. To that Heaven which protects\r\nthe weak from the strong, I commit the care of your innocence and\r\nvirtues, if they have not already received their full reward, and if\r\nyour youth and delicacy have not long since fallen victims to the\r\nviolence of the African trader, the pestilential stench of a Guinea\r\nship, the seasoning in the European colonies, or the lash and lust of\r\na brutal and unrelenting overseer.\r\n\r\nI did not long remain after my sister. I was again sold, and carried\r\nthrough a number of places, till, after travelling a considerable\r\ntime, I came to a town called Tinmah, in the most beautiful country I\r\nhave yet seen in Africa. It was extremely rich, and there were many\r\nrivulets which flowed through it, and supplied a large pond in the\r\ncentre of the town, where the people washed. Here I first saw and\r\ntasted cocoa-nuts, which I thought superior to any nuts I had ever\r\ntasted before; and the trees, which were loaded, were also\r\ninterspersed amongst the houses, which had commodious shades\r\nadjoining, and were in the same manner as ours, the insides being\r\nneatly plastered and whitewashed. Here I also saw and tasted for the\r\nfirst time sugar-cane. Their money consisted of little white shells,\r\nthe size of the finger nail. I was sold here for one hundred and\r\nseventy-two of them by a merchant who lived and brought me there. I\r\nhad been about two or three days at his house, when a wealthy widow, a\r\nneighbour of his, came there one evening, and brought with her an only\r\nson, a young gentleman about my own age and size. Here they saw me;\r\nand, having taken a fancy to me, I was bought of the merchant, and\r\nwent home with them. Her house and premises were situated close to one\r\nof those rivulets I have mentioned, and were the finest I ever saw in\r\nAfrica: they were very extensive, and she had a number of slaves to\r\nattend her. The next day I was washed and perfumed, and when meal-time\r\ncame I was led into the presence of my mistress, and ate and drank\r\nbefore her with her son. This filled me with astonishment; and I could\r\nscarce help expressing my surprise that the young gentleman should\r\nsuffer me, who was bound, to eat with him who was free; and not only\r\nso, but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till I had\r\ntaken first, because I was the eldest, which was agreeable to our\r\ncustom. Indeed every thing here, and all their treatment of me, made\r\nme forget that I was a slave. The language of these people resembled\r\nours so nearly, that we understood each other perfectly. They had also\r\nthe very same customs as we. There were likewise slaves daily to\r\nattend us, while my young master and I with other boys sported with\r\nour darts and bows and arrows, as I had been used to do at home. In\r\nthis resemblance to my former happy state I passed about two months;\r\nand I now began to think I was to be adopted into the family, and was\r\nbeginning to be reconciled to my situation, and to forget by degrees\r\nmy misfortunes, when all at once the delusion vanished; for, without\r\nthe least previous knowledge, one morning early, while my dear master\r\nand companion was still asleep, I was wakened out of my reverie to\r\nfresh sorrow, and hurried away even amongst the uncircumcised.\r\n\r\nThus, at the very moment I dreamed of the greatest happiness, I found\r\nmyself most miserable; and it seemed as if fortune wished to give me\r\nthis taste of joy, only to render the reverse more poignant. The\r\nchange I now experienced was as painful as it was sudden and\r\nunexpected. It was a change indeed from a state of bliss to a scene\r\nwhich is inexpressible by me, as it discovered to me an element I had\r\nnever before beheld, and till then had no idea of, and wherein such\r\ninstances of hardship and cruelty continually occurred as I can never\r\nreflect on but with horror.\r\n\r\nAll the nations and people I had hitherto passed through resembled our\r\nown in their manners, customs, and language: but I came at length to a\r\ncountry, the inhabitants of which differed from us in all those\r\nparticulars. I was very much struck with this difference, especially\r\nwhen I came among a people who did not circumcise, and ate without\r\nwashing their hands. They cooked also in iron pots, and had European\r\ncutlasses and cross bows, which were unknown to us, and fought with\r\ntheir fists amongst themselves. Their women were not so modest as\r\nours, for they ate, and drank, and slept, with their men. But, above\r\nall, I was amazed to see no sacrifices or offerings among them. In\r\nsome of those places the people ornamented themselves with scars, and\r\nlikewise filed their teeth very sharp. They wanted sometimes to\r\nornament me in the same manner, but I would not suffer them; hoping\r\nthat I might some time be among a people who did not thus disfigure\r\nthemselves, as I thought they did. At last I came to the banks of a\r\nlarge river, which was covered with canoes, in which the people\r\nappeared to live with their household utensils and provisions of all\r\nkinds. I was beyond measure astonished at this, as I had never before\r\nseen any water larger than a pond or a rivulet: and my surprise was\r\nmingled with no small fear when I was put into one of these canoes,\r\nand we began to paddle and move along the river. We continued going on\r\nthus till night; and when we came to land, and made fires on the\r\nbanks, each family by themselves, some dragged their canoes on shore,\r\nothers stayed and cooked in theirs, and laid in them all night. Those\r\non the land had mats, of which they made tents, some in the shape of\r\nlittle houses: in these we slept; and after the morning meal we\r\nembarked again and proceeded as before. I was often very much\r\nastonished to see some of the women, as well as the men, jump into the\r\nwater, dive to the bottom, come up again, and swim about. Thus I\r\ncontinued to travel, sometimes by land, sometimes by water, through\r\ndifferent countries and various nations, till, at the end of six or\r\nseven months after I had been kidnapped, I arrived at the sea coast.\r\nIt would be tedious and uninteresting to relate all the incidents\r\nwhich befell me during this journey, and which I have not yet\r\nforgotten; of the various hands I passed through, and the manners and\r\ncustoms of all the different people among whom I lived: I shall\r\ntherefore only observe, that in all the places where I was the soil\r\nwas exceedingly rich; the pomkins, eadas, plantains, yams, &c. &c.\r\nwere in great abundance, and of incredible size. There were also vast\r\nquantities of different gums, though not used for any purpose; and\r\nevery where a great deal of tobacco. The cotton even grew quite wild;\r\nand there was plenty of redwood. I saw no mechanics whatever in all\r\nthe way, except such as I have mentioned. The chief employment in all\r\nthese countries was agriculture, and both the males and females, as\r\nwith us, were brought up to it, and trained in the arts of war.\r\n\r\nThe first object which saluted my eyes when I arrived on the coast was\r\nthe sea, and a slave ship, which was then riding at anchor, and\r\nwaiting for its cargo. These filled me with astonishment, which was\r\nsoon converted into terror when I was carried on board. I was\r\nimmediately handled and tossed up to see if I were sound by some of\r\nthe crew; and I was now persuaded that I had gotten into a world of\r\nbad spirits, and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions\r\ntoo differing so much from ours, their long hair, and the language\r\nthey spoke, (which was very different from any I had ever heard)\r\nunited to confirm me in this belief. Indeed such were the horrors of\r\nmy views and fears at the moment, that, if ten thousand worlds had\r\nbeen my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have\r\nexchanged my condition with that of the meanest slave in my own\r\ncountry. When I looked round the ship too and saw a large furnace or\r\ncopper boiling, and a multitude of black people of every description\r\nchained together, every one of their countenances expressing dejection\r\nand sorrow, I no longer doubted of my fate; and, quite overpowered\r\nwith horror and anguish, I fell motionless on the deck and fainted.\r\nWhen I recovered a little I found some black people about me, who I\r\nbelieved were some of those who brought me on board, and had been\r\nreceiving their pay; they talked to me in order to cheer me, but all\r\nin vain. I asked them if we were not to be eaten by those white men\r\nwith horrible looks, red faces, and loose hair. They told me I was\r\nnot; and one of the crew brought me a small portion of spirituous\r\nliquor in a wine glass; but, being afraid of him, I would not take it\r\nout of his hand. One of the blacks therefore took it from him and gave\r\nit to me, and I took a little down my palate, which, instead of\r\nreviving me, as they thought it would, threw me into the greatest\r\nconsternation at the strange feeling it produced, having never tasted\r\nany such liquor before. Soon after this the blacks who brought me on\r\nboard went off, and left me abandoned to despair. I now saw myself\r\ndeprived of all chance of returning to my native country, or even the\r\nleast glimpse of hope of gaining the shore, which I now considered as\r\nfriendly; and I even wished for my former slavery in preference to my\r\npresent situation, which was filled with horrors of every kind, still\r\nheightened by my ignorance of what I was to undergo. I was not long\r\nsuffered to indulge my grief; I was soon put down under the decks, and\r\nthere I received such a salutation in my nostrils as I had never\r\nexperienced in my life: so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench,\r\nand crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to\r\neat, nor had I the least desire to taste any thing. I now wished for\r\nthe last friend, death, to relieve me; but soon, to my grief, two of\r\nthe white men offered me eatables; and, on my refusing to eat, one of\r\nthem held me fast by the hands, and laid me across I think the\r\nwindlass, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me severely. I had\r\nnever experienced any thing of this kind before; and although, not\r\nbeing used to the water, I naturally feared that element the first\r\ntime I saw it, yet nevertheless, could I have got over the nettings,\r\nI would have jumped over the side, but I could not; and, besides, the\r\ncrew used to watch us very closely who were not chained down to the\r\ndecks, lest we should leap into the water: and I have seen some of\r\nthese poor African prisoners most severely cut for attempting to do\r\nso, and hourly whipped for not eating. This indeed was often the case\r\nwith myself. In a little time after, amongst the poor chained men, I\r\nfound some of my own nation, which in a small degree gave ease to my\r\nmind. I inquired of these what was to be done with us; they gave me to\r\nunderstand we were to be carried to these white people\'s country to\r\nwork for them. I then was a little revived, and thought, if it were no\r\nworse than working, my situation was not so desperate: but still I\r\nfeared I should be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as\r\nI thought, in so savage a manner; for I had never seen among any\r\npeople such instances of brutal cruelty; and this not only shewn\r\ntowards us blacks, but also to some of the whites themselves. One\r\nwhite man in particular I saw, when we were permitted to be on deck,\r\nflogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast, that he\r\ndied in consequence of it; and they tossed him over the side as they\r\nwould have done a brute. This made me fear these people the more; and\r\nI expected nothing less than to be treated in the same manner. I could\r\nnot help expressing my fears and apprehensions to some of my\r\ncountrymen: I asked them if these people had no country, but lived in\r\nthis hollow place (the ship): they told me they did not, but came from\r\na distant one. \'Then,\' said I, \'how comes it in all our country we\r\nnever heard of them?\' They told me because they lived so very far off.\r\nI then asked where were their women? had they any like themselves? I\r\nwas told they had: \'and why,\' said I,\'do we not see them?\' they\r\nanswered, because they were left behind. I asked how the vessel could\r\ngo? they told me they could not tell; but that there were cloths put\r\nupon the masts by the help of the ropes I saw, and then the vessel\r\nwent on; and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the\r\nwater when they liked in order to stop the vessel. I was exceedingly\r\namazed at this account, and really thought they were spirits. I\r\ntherefore wished much to be from amongst them, for I expected they\r\nwould sacrifice me: but my wishes were vain; for we were so quartered\r\nthat it was impossible for any of us to make our escape. While we\r\nstayed on the coast I was mostly on deck; and one day, to my great\r\nastonishment, I saw one of these vessels coming in with the sails up.\r\nAs soon as the whites saw it, they gave a great shout, at which we\r\nwere amazed; and the more so as the vessel appeared larger by\r\napproaching nearer. At last she came to an anchor in my sight, and\r\nwhen the anchor was let go I and my countrymen who saw it were lost in\r\nastonishment to observe the vessel stop; and were not convinced it was\r\ndone by magic. Soon after this the other ship got her boats out, and\r\nthey came on board of us, and the people of both ships seemed very\r\nglad to see each other. Several of the strangers also shook hands with\r\nus black people, and made motions with their hands, signifying I\r\nsuppose we were to go to their country; but we did not understand\r\nthem. At last, when the ship we were in had got in all her cargo, they\r\nmade ready with many fearful noises, and we were all put under deck,\r\nso that we could not see how they managed the vessel. But this\r\ndisappointment was the least of my sorrow. The stench of the hold\r\nwhile we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome, that it was\r\ndangerous to remain there for any time, and some of us had been\r\npermitted to stay on the deck for the fresh air; but now that the\r\nwhole ship\'s cargo were confined together, it became absolutely\r\npestilential. The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate,\r\nadded to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had\r\nscarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced\r\ncopious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for\r\nrespiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a\r\nsickness among the slaves, of which many died, thus falling victims to\r\nthe improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their purchasers. This\r\nwretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains,\r\nnow become insupportable; and the filth of the necessary tubs, into\r\nwhich the children often fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks\r\nof the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene\r\nof horror almost inconceivable. Happily perhaps for myself I was soon\r\nreduced so low here that it was thought necessary to keep me almost\r\nalways on deck; and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters. In\r\nthis situation I expected every hour to share the fate of my\r\ncompanions, some of whom were almost daily brought upon deck at the\r\npoint of death, which I began to hope would soon put an end to my\r\nmiseries. Often did I think many of the inhabitants of the deep much\r\nmore happy than myself. I envied them the freedom they enjoyed, and as\r\noften wished I could change my condition for theirs. Every\r\ncircumstance I met with served only to render my state more painful,\r\nand heighten my apprehensions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the\r\nwhites. One day they had taken a number of fishes; and when they had\r\nkilled and satisfied themselves with as many as they thought fit, to\r\nour astonishment who were on the deck, rather than give any of them to\r\nus to eat as we expected, they tossed the remaining fish into the sea\r\nagain, although we begged and prayed for some as well as we could, but\r\nin vain; and some of my countrymen, being pressed by hunger, took an\r\nopportunity, when they thought no one saw them, of trying to get a\r\nlittle privately; but they were discovered, and the attempt procured\r\nthem some very severe floggings. One day, when we had a smooth sea and\r\nmoderate wind, two of my wearied countrymen who were chained together\r\n(I was near them at the time), preferring death to such a life of\r\nmisery, somehow made through the nettings and jumped into the sea:\r\nimmediately another quite dejected fellow, who, on account of his\r\nillness, was suffered to be out of irons, also followed their example;\r\nand I believe many more would very soon have done the same if they had\r\nnot been prevented by the ship\'s crew, who were instantly alarmed.\r\nThose of us that were the most active were in a moment put down under\r\nthe deck, and there was such a noise and confusion amongst the people\r\nof the ship as I never heard before, to stop her, and get the boat out\r\nto go after the slaves. However two of the wretches were drowned, but\r\nthey got the other, and afterwards flogged him unmercifully for thus\r\nattempting to prefer death to slavery. In this manner we continued to\r\nundergo more hardships than I can now relate, hardships which are\r\ninseparable from this accursed trade. Many a time we were near\r\nsuffocation from the want of fresh air, which we were often without\r\nfor whole days together. This, and the stench of the necessary tubs,\r\ncarried off many. During our passage I first saw flying fishes, which\r\nsurprised me very much: they used frequently to fly across the ship,\r\nand many of them fell on the deck. I also now first saw the use of the\r\nquadrant; I had often with astonishment seen the mariners make\r\nobservations with it, and I could not think what it meant. They at\r\nlast took notice of my surprise; and one of them, willing to increase\r\nit, as well as to gratify my curiosity, made me one day look through\r\nit. The clouds appeared to me to be land, which disappeared as they\r\npassed along. This heightened my wonder; and I was now more persuaded\r\nthan ever that I was in another world, and that every thing about me\r\nwas magic. At last we came in sight of the island of Barbadoes, at\r\nwhich the whites on board gave a great shout, and made many signs of\r\njoy to us. We did not know what to think of this; but as the vessel\r\ndrew nearer we plainly saw the harbour, and other ships of different\r\nkinds and sizes; and we soon anchored amongst them off Bridge Town.\r\nMany merchants and planters now came on board, though it was in the\r\nevening. They put us in separate parcels, and examined us attentively.\r\nThey also made us jump, and pointed to the land, signifying we were to\r\ngo there. We thought by this we should be eaten by these ugly men, as\r\nthey appeared to us; and, when soon after we were all put down under\r\nthe deck again, there was much dread and trembling among us, and\r\nnothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from these\r\napprehensions, insomuch that at last the white people got some old\r\nslaves from the land to pacify us. They told us we were not to be\r\neaten, but to work, and were soon to go on land, where we should see\r\nmany of our country people. This report eased us much; and sure\r\nenough, soon after we were landed, there came to us Africans of all\r\nlanguages. We were conducted immediately to the merchant\'s yard, where\r\nwe were all pent up together like so many sheep in a fold, without\r\nregard to sex or age. As every object was new to me every thing I saw\r\nfilled me with surprise. What struck me first was that the houses were\r\nbuilt with stories, and in every other respect different from those in\r\nAfrica: but I was still more astonished on seeing people on horseback.\r\nI did not know what this could mean; and indeed I thought these people\r\nwere full of nothing but magical arts. While I was in this\r\nastonishment one of my fellow prisoners spoke to a countryman of his\r\nabout the horses, who said they were the same kind they had in their\r\ncountry. I understood them, though they were from a distant part of\r\nAfrica, and I thought it odd I had not seen any horses there; but\r\nafterwards, when I came to converse with different Africans, I found\r\nthey had many horses amongst them, and much larger than those I then\r\nsaw. We were not many days in the merchant\'s custody before we were\r\nsold after their usual manner, which is this:--On a signal given,(as\r\nthe beat of a drum) the buyers rush at once into the yard where the\r\nslaves are confined, and make choice of that parcel they like best.\r\nThe noise and clamour with which this is attended, and the eagerness\r\nvisible in the countenances of the buyers, serve not a little to\r\nincrease the apprehensions of the terrified Africans, who may well be\r\nsupposed to consider them as the ministers of that destruction to\r\nwhich they think themselves devoted. In this manner, without scruple,\r\nare relations and friends separated, most of them never to see each\r\nother again. I remember in the vessel in which I was brought over, in\r\nthe men\'s apartment, there were several brothers, who, in the sale,\r\nwere sold in different lots; and it was very moving on this occasion\r\nto see and hear their cries at parting. O, ye nominal Christians!\r\nmight not an African ask you, learned you this from your God, who says\r\nunto you, Do unto all men as you would men should do unto you? Is it\r\nnot enough that we are torn from our country and friends to toil for\r\nyour luxury and lust of gain? Must every tender feeling be likewise\r\nsacrificed to your avarice? Are the dearest friends and relations, now\r\nrendered more dear by their separation from their kindred, still to be\r\nparted from each other, and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of\r\nslavery with the small comfort of being together and mingling their\r\nsufferings and sorrows? Why are parents to lose their children,\r\nbrothers their sisters, or husbands their wives? Surely this is a new\r\nrefinement in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage to atone for\r\nit, thus aggravates distress, and adds fresh horrors even to the\r\nwretchedness of slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

On the passage we were better treated\r\nthan when we were coming from Africa, and we had plenty of rice and\r\nfat pork. We were landed up a river a good way from the sea, about\r\nVirginia county, where we saw few or none of our native Africans, and\r\nnot one soul who could talk to me. I was a few weeks weeding grass,\r\nand gathering stones in a plantation; and at last all my companions\r\nwere distributed different ways, and only myself was left. I was now\r\nexceedingly miserable, and thought myself worse off than any of the\r\nrest of my companions; for they could talk to each other, but I had no\r\nperson to speak to that I could understand. In this state I was\r\nconstantly grieving and pining, and wishing for death rather than any\r\nthing else. While I was in this plantation the gentleman, to whom I\r\nsuppose the estate belonged, being unwell, I was one day sent for to\r\nhis dwelling house to fan him; when I came into the room where he was\r\nI was very much affrighted at some things I saw, and the more so as I\r\nhad seen a black woman slave as I came through the house, who was\r\ncooking the dinner, and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with\r\nvarious kinds of iron machines; she had one particularly on her head,\r\nwhich locked her mouth so fast that she could scarcely speak; and\r\ncould not eat nor drink. I was much astonished and shocked at this\r\ncontrivance, which I afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle.\r\nSoon after I had a fan put into my hand, to fan the gentleman while he\r\nslept; and so I did indeed with great fear. While he was fast asleep I\r\nindulged myself a great deal in looking about the room, which to me\r\nappeared very fine and curious. The first object that engaged my\r\nattention was a watch which hung on the chimney, and was going. I was\r\nquite surprised at the noise it made, and was afraid it would tell the\r\ngentleman any thing I might do amiss: and when I immediately after\r\nobserved a picture hanging in the room, which appeared constantly to\r\nlook at me, I was still more affrighted, having never seen such things\r\nas these before. At one time I thought it was something relative to\r\nmagic; and not seeing it move I thought it might be some way the\r\nwhites had to keep their great men when they died, and offer them\r\nlibation as we used to do to our friendly spirits. In this state of\r\nanxiety I remained till my master awoke, when I was dismissed out of\r\nthe room, to my no small satisfaction and relief; for I thought that\r\nthese people were all made up of wonders. In this place I was called\r\nJacob; but on board the African snow I was called Michael. I had been\r\nsome time in this miserable, forlorn, and much dejected state, without\r\nhaving any one to talk to, which made my life a burden, when the kind\r\nand unknown hand of the Creator (who in very deed leads the blind in a\r\nway they know not) now began to appear, to my comfort; for one day the\r\ncaptain of a merchant ship, called the Industrious Bee, came on some\r\nbusiness to my master\'s house. This gentleman, whose name was Michael\r\nHenry Pascal, was a lieutenant in the royal navy, but now commanded\r\nthis trading ship, which was somewhere in the confines of the county\r\nmany miles off. While he was at my master\'s house it happened that he\r\nsaw me, and liked me so well that he made a purchase of me. I think I\r\nhave often heard him say he gave thirty or forty pounds sterling for\r\nme; but I do not now remember which. However, he meant me for a\r\npresent to some of his friends in England: and I was sent accordingly\r\nfrom the house of my then master, one Mr. Campbell, to the place where\r\nthe ship lay; I was conducted on horseback by an elderly black man, (a\r\nmode of travelling which appeared very odd to me). When I arrived I\r\nwas carried on board a fine large ship, loaded with tobacco, &c. and\r\njust ready to sail for England. I now thought my condition much\r\nmended; I had sails to lie on, and plenty of good victuals to eat; and\r\nevery body on board used me very kindly, quite contrary to what I had\r\nseen of any white people before; I therefore began to think that they\r\nwere not all of the same disposition. A few days after I was on board\r\nwe sailed for England. I was still at a loss to conjecture my destiny.\r\nBy this time, however, I could smatter a little imperfect English; and\r\nI wanted to know as well as I could where we were going. Some of the\r\npeople of the ship used to tell me they were going to carry me back to\r\nmy own country, and this made me very happy. I was quite rejoiced at\r\nthe sound of going back; and thought if I should get home what wonders\r\nI should have to tell. But I was reserved for another fate, and was\r\nsoon undeceived when we came within sight of the English coast. While\r\nI was on board this ship, my captain and master named me _Gustavus\r\nVassa_. I at that time began to understand him a little, and refused to\r\nbe called so, and told him as well as I could that I would be called\r\nJacob; but he said I should not, and still called me Gustavus; and\r\nwhen I refused to answer to my new name, which at first I did, it\r\ngained me many a cuff; so at length I submitted, and was obliged to\r\nbear the present name, by which I have been known ever since. The ship\r\nhad a very long passage; and on that account we had very short\r\nallowance of provisions. Towards the last we had only one pound and a\r\nhalf of bread per week, and about the same quantity of meat, and one\r\nquart of water a-day. We spoke with only one vessel the whole time we\r\nwere at sea, and but once we caught a few fishes. In our extremities\r\nthe captain and people told me in jest they would kill and eat me; but\r\nI thought them in earnest, and was depressed beyond measure, expecting\r\nevery moment to be my last. While I was in this situation one evening\r\nthey caught, with a good deal of trouble, a large shark, and got it on\r\nboard. This gladdened my poor heart exceedingly, as I thought it would\r\nserve the people to eat instead of their eating me; but very soon, to\r\nmy astonishment, they cut off a small part of the tail, and tossed the\r\nrest over the side. This renewed my consternation; and I did not know\r\nwhat to think of these white people, though I very much feared they\r\nwould kill and eat me. There was on board the ship a young lad who had\r\nnever been at sea before, about four or five years older than myself:\r\nhis name was Richard Baker. He was a native of America, had received\r\nan excellent education, and was of a most amiable temper. Soon after I\r\nwent on board he shewed me a great deal of partiality and attention,\r\nand in return I grew extremely fond of him. We at length became\r\ninseparable; and, for the space of two years, he was of very great use\r\nto me, and was my constant companion and instructor. Although this\r\ndear youth had many slaves of his own, yet he and I have gone through\r\nmany sufferings together on shipboard; and we have many nights lain in\r\neach other\'s bosoms when we were in great distress. Thus such a\r\nfriendship was cemented between us as we cherished till his death,\r\nwhich, to my very great sorrow, happened in the year 1759, when he was\r\nup the Archipelago, on board his majesty\'s ship the Preston: an event\r\nwhich I have never ceased to regret, as I lost at once a kind\r\ninterpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend; who, at\r\nthe age of fifteen, discovered a mind superior to prejudice; and who\r\nwas not ashamed to notice, to associate with, and to be the friend and\r\ninstructor of one who was ignorant, a stranger, of a different\r\ncomplexion, and a slave! My master had lodged in his mother\'s house in\r\nAmerica: he respected him very much, and made him always eat with him\r\nin the cabin. He used often to tell him jocularly that he would kill\r\nme to eat. Sometimes he would say to me--the black people were not\r\ngood to eat, and would ask me if we did not eat people in my country.\r\nI said, No: then he said he would kill Dick (as he always called him)\r\nfirst, and afterwards me. Though this hearing relieved my mind a\r\nlittle as to myself, I was alarmed for Dick and whenever he was called\r\nI used to be very much afraid he was to be killed; and I would peep\r\nand watch to see if they were going to kill him: nor was I free from\r\nthis consternation till we made the land. One night we lost a man\r\noverboard; and the cries and noise were so great and confused, in\r\nstopping the ship, that I, who did not know what was the matter,\r\nbegan, as usual, to be very much afraid, and to think they were going\r\nto make an offering with me, and perform some magic; which I still\r\nbelieved they dealt in. As the waves were very high I thought the\r\nRuler of the seas was angry, and I expected to be offered up to\r\nappease him. This filled my mind with agony, and I could not any more\r\nthat night close my eyes again to rest. However, when daylight\r\nappeared I was a little eased in my mind; but still every time I was\r\ncalled I used to think it was to be killed. Some time after this we\r\nsaw some very large fish, which I afterwards found were called\r\ngrampusses. They looked to me extremely terrible, and made their\r\nappearance just at dusk; and were so near as to blow the water on the\r\nship\'s deck. I believed them to be the rulers of the sea; and, as the\r\nwhite people did not make any offerings at any time, I thought they\r\nwere angry with them: and, at last, what confirmed my belief was, the\r\nwind just then died away, and a calm ensued, and in consequence of it\r\nthe ship stopped going. I supposed that the fish had performed this,\r\nand I hid myself in the fore part of the ship, through fear of being\r\noffered up to appease them, every minute peeping and quaking: but my\r\ngood friend Dick came shortly towards me, and I took an opportunity to\r\nask him, as well as I could, what these fish were. Not being able to\r\ntalk much English, I could but just make him understand my question;\r\nand not at all, when I asked him if any offerings were to be made to\r\nthem: however, he told me these fish would swallow any body; which\r\nsufficiently alarmed me. Here he was called away by the captain, who\r\nwas leaning over the quarter-deck railing and looking at the fish; and\r\nmost of the people were busied in getting a barrel of pitch to light,\r\nfor them to play with. The captain now called me to him, having\r\nlearned some of my apprehensions from Dick; and having diverted\r\nhimself and others for some time with my fears, which appeared\r\nludicrous enough in my crying and trembling, he dismissed me. The\r\nbarrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the side into the water:\r\nby this time it was just dark, and the fish went after it; and, to my\r\ngreat joy, I saw them no more.\r\n\r\nHowever, all my alarms began to subside when we got sight of land; and\r\nat last the ship arrived at Falmouth, after a passage of thirteen\r\nweeks. Every heart on board seemed gladdened on our reaching the\r\nshore, and none more than mine. The captain immediately went on shore,\r\nand sent on board some fresh provisions, which we wanted very much:\r\nwe made good use of them, and our famine was soon turned into\r\nfeasting, almost without ending. It was about the beginning of the\r\nspring 1757 when I arrived in England, and I was near twelve years of\r\nage at that time. I was very much struck with the buildings and the\r\npavement of the streets in Falmouth; and, indeed, any object I saw\r\nfilled me with new surprise. One morning, when I got upon deck, I saw\r\nit covered all over with the snow that fell over-night: as I had never\r\nseen any thing of the kind before, I thought it was salt; so I\r\nimmediately ran down to the mate and desired him, as well as I could,\r\nto come and see how somebody in the night had thrown salt all over the\r\ndeck. He, knowing what it was, desired me to bring some of it down to\r\nhim: accordingly I took up a handful of it, which I found very cold\r\nindeed; and when I brought it to him he desired me to taste it. I did\r\nso, and I was surprised beyond measure. I then asked him what it was;\r\nhe told me it was snow: but I could not in anywise understand him. He\r\nasked me if we had no such thing in my country; and I told him, No. I\r\nthen asked him the use of it, and who made it; he told me a great man\r\nin the heavens, called God: but here again I was to all intents and\r\npurposes at a loss to understand him; and the more so, when a little\r\nafter I saw the air filled with it, in a heavy shower, which fell down\r\non the same day. After this I went to church; and having never been at\r\nsuch a place before, I was again amazed at seeing and hearing the\r\nservice. I asked all I could about it; and they gave me to understand\r\nit was worshipping God, who made us and all things. I was still at a\r\ngreat loss, and soon got into an endless field of inquiries, as well\r\nas I was able to speak and ask about things. However, my little friend\r\nDick used to be my best interpreter; for I could make free with him,\r\nand he always instructed me with pleasure: and from what I could\r\nunderstand by him of this God, and in seeing these white people did\r\nnot sell one another, as we did, I was much pleased; and in this I\r\nthought they were much happier than we Africans. I was astonished at\r\nthe wisdom of the white people in all things I saw; but was amazed at\r\ntheir not sacrificing, or making any offerings, and eating with\r\nunwashed hands, and touching the dead. I likewise could not help\r\nremarking the particular slenderness of their women, which I did not\r\nat first like; and I thought they were not so modest and shamefaced as\r\nthe African women.\r\n\r\nI had often seen my master and Dick employed in reading; and I had a\r\ngreat curiosity to talk to the books, as I thought they did; and so to\r\nlearn how all things had a beginning: for that purpose I have often\r\ntaken up a book, and have talked to it, and then put my ears to it,\r\nwhen alone, in hopes it would answer me; and I have been very much\r\nconcerned when I found it remained silent.\r\n\r\nMy master lodged at the house of a gentleman in Falmouth, who had a\r\nfine little daughter about six or seven years of age, and she grew\r\nprodigiously fond of me; insomuch that we used to eat together, and\r\nhad servants to wait on us. I was so much caressed by this family that\r\nit often reminded me of the treatment I had received from my little\r\nnoble African master. After I had been here a few days, I was sent on\r\nboard of the ship; but the child cried so much after me that nothing\r\ncould pacify her till I was sent for again. It is ludicrous enough,\r\nthat I began to fear I should be betrothed to this young lady; and\r\nwhen my master asked me if I would stay there with her behind him, as\r\nhe was going away with the ship, which had taken in the tobacco again,\r\nI cried immediately, and said I would not leave her. At last, by\r\nstealth, one night I was sent on board the ship again; and in a little\r\ntime we sailed for Guernsey, where she was in part owned by a\r\nmerchant, one Nicholas Doberry. As I was now amongst a people who had\r\nnot their faces scarred, like some of the African nations where I had\r\nbeen, I was very glad I did not let them ornament me in that manner\r\nwhen I was with them. When we arrived at Guernsey, my master placed me\r\nto board and lodge with one of his mates, who had a wife and family\r\nthere; and some months afterwards he went to England, and left me in\r\ncare of this mate, together with my friend Dick: This mate had a\r\nlittle daughter, aged about five or six years, with whom I used to be\r\nmuch delighted. I had often observed that when her mother washed her\r\nface it looked very rosy; but when she washed mine it did not look so:\r\nI therefore tried oftentimes myself if I could not by washing make my\r\nface of the same colour as my little play-mate (Mary), but it was all\r\nin vain; and I now began to be mortified at the difference in our\r\ncomplexions. This woman behaved to me with great kindness and\r\nattention; and taught me every thing in the same manner as she did her\r\nown child, and indeed in every respect treated me as such. I remained\r\nhere till the summer of the year 1757; when my master, being appointed\r\nfirst lieutenant of his majesty\'s ship the Roebuck, sent for Dick and\r\nme, and his old mate: on this we all left Guernsey, and set out for\r\nEngland in a sloop bound for London. As we were coming up towards the\r\nNore, where the Roebuck lay, a man of war\'s boat came alongside to\r\npress our people; on which each man ran to hide himself. I was very\r\nmuch frightened at this, though I did not know what it meant, or what\r\nto think or do. However I went and hid myself also under a hencoop.\r\nImmediately afterwards the press-gang came on board with their swords\r\ndrawn, and searched all about, pulled the people out by force, and put\r\nthem into the boat. At last I was found out also: the man that found\r\nme held me up by the heels while they all made their sport of me, I\r\nroaring and crying out all the time most lustily: but at last the\r\nmate, who was my conductor, seeing this, came to my assistance, and\r\ndid all he could to pacify me; but all to very little purpose, till I\r\nhad seen the boat go off. Soon afterwards we came to the Nore, where\r\nthe Roebuck lay; and, to our great joy, my master came on board to us,\r\nand brought us to the ship. When I went on board this large ship, I\r\nwas amazed indeed to see the quantity of men and the guns. However my\r\nsurprise began to diminish as my knowledge increased; and I ceased to\r\nfeel those apprehensions and alarms which had taken such strong\r\npossession of me when I first came among the Europeans, and for some\r\ntime after. I began now to pass to an opposite extreme; I was so far\r\nfrom being afraid of any thing new which I saw, that, after I had been\r\nsome time in this ship, I even began to long for a battle. My griefs\r\ntoo, which in young minds are not perpetual, were now wearing away;\r\nand I soon enjoyed myself pretty well, and felt tolerably easy in my\r\npresent situation. There was a number of boys on board, which still\r\nmade it more agreeable; for we were always together, and a great part\r\nof our time was spent in play. I remained in this ship a considerable\r\ntime, during which we made several cruises, and visited a variety of\r\nplaces: among others we were twice in Holland, and brought over\r\nseveral persons of distinction from it, whose names I do not now\r\nremember. On the passage, one day, for the diversion of those\r\ngentlemen, all the boys were called on the quarter-deck, and were\r\npaired proportionably, and then made to fight; after which the\r\ngentleman gave the combatants from five to nine shillings each. This\r\nwas the first time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew\r\nwhat it was to have a bloody nose before. This made me fight most\r\ndesperately; I suppose considerably more than an hour: and at last,\r\nboth of us being weary, we were parted. I had a great deal of this\r\nkind of sport afterwards, in which the captain and the ship\'s company\r\nused very much to encourage me. Sometime afterwards the ship went to\r\nLeith in Scotland, and from thence to the Orkneys, where I was\r\nsurprised in seeing scarcely any night: and from thence we sailed with\r\na great fleet, full of soldiers, for England. All this time we had\r\nnever come to an engagement, though we were frequently cruising off\r\nthe coast of France: during which we chased many vessels, and took in\r\nall seventeen prizes. I had been learning many of the manoeuvres of\r\nthe ship during our cruise; and I was several times made to fire the\r\nguns. One evening, off Havre de Grace, just as it was growing dark, we\r\nwere standing off shore, and met with a fine large French-built\r\nfrigate. We got all things immediately ready for fighting; and I now\r\nexpected I should be gratified in seeing an engagement, which I had so\r\nlong wished for in vain. But the very moment the word of command was\r\ngiven to fire we heard those on board the other ship cry \'Haul down\r\nthe jib;\' and in that instant she hoisted English colours. There was\r\ninstantly with us an amazing cry of--Avast! or stop firing; and I\r\nthink one or two guns had been let off, but happily they did no\r\nmischief. We had hailed them several times; but they not hearing, we\r\nreceived no answer, which was the cause of our firing. The boat was\r\nthen sent on board of her, and she proved to be the Ambuscade man of\r\nwar, to my no small disappointment. We returned to Portsmouth, without\r\nhaving been in any action, just at the trial of Admiral Byng (whom I\r\nsaw several times during it): and my master having left the ship, and\r\ngone to London for promotion, Dick and I were put on board the Savage\r\nsloop of war, and we went in her to assist in bringing off the St.\r\nGeorge man of war, that had ran ashore somewhere on the coast. After\r\nstaying a few weeks on board the Savage, Dick and I were sent on shore\r\nat Deal, where we remained some short time, till my master sent for us\r\nto London, the place I had long desired exceedingly to see. We\r\ntherefore both with great pleasure got into a waggon, and came to\r\nLondon, where we were received by a Mr. Guerin, a relation of my\r\nmaster. This gentleman had two sisters, very amiable ladies, who took\r\nmuch notice and great care of me. Though I had desired so much to see\r\nLondon, when I arrived in it I was unfortunately unable to gratify my\r\ncuriosity; for I had at this time the chilblains to such a degree that\r\nI could not stand for several months, and I was obliged to be sent to\r\nSt. George\'s Hospital. There I grew so ill, that the doctors wanted to\r\ncut my left leg off at different times, apprehending a mortification;\r\nbut I always said I would rather die than suffer it; and happily (I\r\nthank God) I recovered without the operation. After being there\r\nseveral weeks, and just as I had recovered, the small-pox broke out on\r\nme, so that I was again confined; and I thought myself now\r\nparticularly unfortunate. However I soon recovered again; and by this\r\ntime my master having been promoted to be first lieutenant of the\r\nPreston man of war of fifty guns, then new at Deptford, Dick and I\r\nwere sent on board her, and soon after we went to Holland to bring\r\nover the late Duke of ---- to England.--While I was in this ship an\r\nincident happened, which, though trifling, I beg leave to relate, as I\r\ncould not help taking particular notice of it, and considering it then\r\nas a judgment of God. One morning a young man was looking up to the\r\nfore-top, and in a wicked tone, common on shipboard, d----d his eyes\r\nabout something. Just at the moment some small particles of dirt fell\r\ninto his left eye, and by the evening it was very much inflamed. The\r\nnext day it grew worse; and within six or seven days he lost it. From\r\nthis ship my master was appointed a lieutenant on board the Royal\r\nGeorge. When he was going he wished me to stay on board the Preston,\r\nto learn the French horn; but the ship being ordered for Turkey I\r\ncould not think of leaving my master, to whom I was very warmly\r\nattached; and I told him if he left me behind it would break my heart.\r\nThis prevailed on him to take me with him; but he left Dick on board\r\nthe Preston, whom I embraced at parting for the last time. The Royal\r\nGeorge was the largest ship I had ever seen; so that when I came on\r\nboard of her I was surprised at the number of people, men, women, and\r\nchildren, of every denomination; and the largeness of the guns, many\r\nof them also of brass, which I had never seen before. Here were also\r\nshops or stalls of every kind of goods, and people crying their\r\ndifferent commodities about the ship as in a town. To me it appeared a\r\nlittle world, into which I was again cast without a friend, for I had\r\nno longer my dear companion Dick. We did not stay long here. My master\r\nwas not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to be sixth\r\nlieutenant of the Namur, which was then at Spithead, fitting up for\r\nVice-admiral Boscawen, who was going with a large fleet on an\r\nexpedition against Louisburgh. The crew of the Royal George were\r\nturned over to her, and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoisted\r\non board, the blue at the maintop-gallant mast head. There was a very\r\ngreat fleet of men of war of every description assembled together for\r\nthis expedition, and I was in hopes soon to have an opportunity of\r\nbeing gratified with a sea-fight. All things being now in readiness,\r\nthis mighty fleet (for there was also Admiral Cornish\'s fleet in\r\ncompany, destined for the East Indies) at last weighed anchor, and\r\nsailed. The two fleets continued in company for several days, and then\r\nparted; Admiral Cornish, in the Lenox, having first saluted our\r\nadmiral in the Namur, which he returned. We then steered for America;\r\nbut, by contrary winds, we were driven to Teneriffe, where I was\r\nstruck with its noted peak. Its prodigious height, and its form,\r\nresembling a sugar-loaf, filled me with wonder. We remained in sight\r\nof this island some days, and then proceeded for America, which we\r\nsoon made, and got into a very commodious harbour called St. George,\r\nin Halifax, where we had fish in great plenty, and all other fresh\r\nprovisions. We were here joined by different men of war and transport\r\nships with soldiers; after which, our fleet being increased to a\r\nprodigious number of ships of all kinds, we sailed for Cape Breton in\r\nNova Scotia. We had the good and gallant General Wolfe on board our\r\nship, whose affability made him highly esteemed and beloved by all the\r\nmen. He often honoured me, as well as other boys, with marks of his\r\nnotice; and saved me once a flogging for fighting with a young\r\ngentleman. We arrived at Cape Breton in the summer of 1758: and here\r\nthe soldiers were to be landed, in order to make an attack upon\r\nLouisbourgh. My master had some part in superintending the landing;\r\nand here I was in a small measure gratified in seeing an encounter\r\nbetween our men and the enemy. The French were posted on the shore to\r\nreceive us, and disputed our landing for a long time; but at last they\r\nwere driven from their trenches, and a complete landing was effected.\r\nOur troops pursued them as far as the town of Louisbourgh. In this\r\naction many were killed on both sides. One thing remarkable I saw this\r\nday:--A lieutenant of the Princess Amelia, who, as well as my master,\r\nsuperintended the landing, was giving the word of command, and while\r\nhis mouth was open a musquet ball went through it, and passed out at\r\nhis cheek. I had that day in my hand the scalp of an indian king, who\r\nwas killed in the engagement: the scalp had been taken off by an\r\nHighlander. I saw this king\'s ornaments too, which were very curious,\r\nand made of feathers.\r\n\r\nOur land forces laid siege to the town of Louisbourgh, while the\r\nFrench men of war were blocked up in the harbour by the fleet, the\r\nbatteries at the same time playing upon them from the land. This they\r\ndid with such effect, that one day I saw some of the ships set on fire\r\nby the shells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them\r\nwere quite burnt. At another time, about fifty boats belonging to the\r\nEnglish men of war, commanded by Captain George Balfour of the \xc3\x86tna\r\nfire-ship, and another junior captain, Laforey, attacked and boarded\r\nthe only two remaining French men of war in the harbour. They also set\r\nfire to a seventy-gun ship, but a sixty-four, called the Bienfaisant,\r\nthey brought off. During my stay here I had often an opportunity of\r\nbeing near Captain Balfour, who was pleased to notice me, and liked me\r\nso much that he often asked my master to let him have me, but he would\r\nnot part with me; and no consideration could have induced me to leave\r\nhim. At last Louisbourgh was taken, and the English men of war came\r\ninto the harbour before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more\r\nliberty of indulging myself, and I went often on shore. When the ships\r\nwere in the harbour we had the most beautiful procession on the water\r\nI ever saw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full\r\ndressed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came\r\nalongside of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on shore in his\r\nbarge, followed by the other officers in order of seniority, to take\r\npossession, as I suppose, of the town and fort. Some time after this\r\nthe French governor and his lady, and other persons of note, came on\r\nboard our ship to dine. On this occasion our ships were dressed with\r\ncolours of all kinds, from the topgallant-mast head to the deck; and\r\nthis, with the firing of guns, formed a most grand and magnificent\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as every thing here was settled Admiral Boscawen sailed with\r\npart of the fleet for England, leaving some ships behind with\r\nRear-admirals Sir Charles Hardy and Durell. It was now winter; and one\r\nevening, during our passage home, about dusk, when we were in the\r\nchannel, or near soundings, and were beginning to look for land, we\r\ndescried seven sail of large men of war, which stood off shore.\r\nSeveral people on board of our ship said, as the two fleets were (in\r\nforty minutes from the first sight) within hail of each other, that\r\nthey were English men of war; and some of our people even began to\r\nname some of the ships. By this time both fleets began to mingle, and\r\nour admiral ordered his flag to be hoisted. At that instant the other\r\nfleet, which were French, hoisted their ensigns, and gave us a\r\nbroadside as they passed by. Nothing could create greater surprise and\r\nconfusion among us than this: the wind was high, the sea rough, and we\r\nhad our lower and middle deck guns housed in, so that not a single gun\r\non board was ready to be fired at any of the French ships. However,\r\nthe Royal William and the Somerset being our sternmost ships, became a\r\nlittle prepared, and each gave the French ships a broadside as they\r\npassed by. I afterwards heard this was a French squadron, commanded by\r\nMons. Conflans; and certainly had the Frenchmen known our condition,\r\nand had a mind to fight us, they might have done us great mischief.\r\nBut we were not long before we were prepared for an engagement.\r\nImmediately many things were tossed overboard; the ships were made\r\nready for fighting as soon as possible; and about ten at night we had\r\nbent a new main sail, the old one being split. Being now in readiness\r\nfor fighting, we wore ship, and stood after the French fleet, who\r\nwere one or two ships in number more than we. However we gave them\r\nchase, and continued pursuing them all night; and at daylight we saw\r\nsix of them, all large ships of the line, and an English East\r\nIndiaman, a prize they had taken. We chased them all day till between\r\nthree and four o\'clock in the evening, when we came up with, and\r\npassed within a musquet shot of, one seventy-four gun ship, and the\r\nIndiaman also, who now hoisted her colours, but immediately hauled\r\nthem down again. On this we made a signal for the other ships to take\r\npossession of her; and, supposing the man of war would likewise\r\nstrike, we cheered, but she did not; though if we had fired into her,\r\nfrom being so near, we must have taken her. To my utter surprise the\r\nSomerset, who was the next ship astern of the Namur, made way\r\nlikewise; and, thinking they were sure of this French ship, they\r\ncheered in the same manner, but still continued to follow us. The\r\nFrench Commodore was about a gun-shot ahead of all, running from us\r\nwith all speed; and about four o\'clock he carried his foretopmast\r\noverboard. This caused another loud cheer with us; and a little after\r\nthe topmast came close by us; but, to our great surprise, instead of\r\ncoming up with her, we found she went as fast as ever, if not faster.\r\nThe sea grew now much smoother; and the wind lulling, the seventy-four\r\ngun ship we had passed came again by us in the very same direction,\r\nand so near, that we heard her people talk as she went by; yet not a\r\nshot was fired on either side; and about five or six o\'clock, just as\r\nit grew dark, she joined her commodore. We chased all night; but the\r\nnext day they were out of sight, so that we saw no more of them; and\r\nwe only had the old Indiaman (called Carnarvon I think) for our\r\ntrouble. After this we stood in for the channel, and soon made the\r\nland; and, about the close of the year 1758-9, we got safe to St.\r\nHelen\'s. Here the Namur ran aground; and also another large ship\r\nastern of us; but, by starting our water, and tossing many things\r\noverboard to lighten her, we got the ships off without any damage. We\r\nstayed for a short time at Spithead, and then went into Portsmouth\r\nharbour to refit; from whence the admiral went to London; and my\r\nmaster and I soon followed, with a press-gang, as we wanted some hands\r\nto complete our complement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

From the various scenes I had beheld\r\non shipboard, I soon grew a stranger to terror of every kind, and was,\r\nin that respect at least, almost an Englishman. I have often reflected\r\nwith surprise that I never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous\r\ndangers I have been in, that I was filled with at the first sight of\r\nthe Europeans, and at every act of theirs, even the most trifling,\r\nwhen I first came among them, and for some time afterwards. That fear,\r\nhowever, which was the effect of my ignorance, wore away as I began to\r\nknow them. I could now speak English tolerably well, and I perfectly\r\nunderstood every thing that was said. I now not only felt myself\r\nquite easy with these new countrymen, but relished their society and\r\nmanners. I no longer looked upon them as spirits, but as men superior\r\nto us; and therefore I had the stronger desire to resemble them; to\r\nimbibe their spirit, and imitate their manners; I therefore embraced\r\nevery occasion of improvement; and every new thing that I observed I\r\ntreasured up in my memory. I had long wished to be able to read and\r\nwrite; and for this purpose I took every opportunity to gain\r\ninstruction, but had made as yet very little progress. However, when I\r\nwent to London with my master, I had soon an opportunity of improving\r\nmyself, which I gladly embraced. Shortly after my arrival, he sent me\r\nto wait upon the Miss Guerins, who had treated me with much kindness\r\nwhen I was there before; and they sent me to school.\r\n\r\nWhile I was attending these ladies their servants told me I could not\r\ngo to Heaven unless I was baptized. This made me very uneasy; for I\r\nhad now some faint idea of a future state: accordingly I communicated\r\nmy anxiety to the eldest Miss Guerin, with whom I was become a\r\nfavourite, and pressed her to have me baptized; when to my great joy\r\nshe told me I should. She had formerly asked my master to let me be\r\nbaptized, but he had refused; however she now insisted on it; and he\r\nbeing under some obligation to her brother complied with her request;\r\nso I was baptized in St. Margaret\'s church, Westminster, in February\r\n1759, by my present name. The clergyman, at the same time, gave me a\r\nbook, called a Guide to the Indians, written by the Bishop of Sodor\r\nand Man. On this occasion Miss Guerin did me the honour to stand as\r\ngodmother, and afterwards gave me a treat. I used to attend these\r\nladies about the town, in which service I was extremely happy; as I\r\nhad thus many opportunities of seeing London, which I desired of all\r\nthings. I was sometimes, however, with my master at his\r\nrendezvous-house, which was at the foot of Westminster-bridge. Here I\r\nused to enjoy myself in playing about the bridge stairs, and often in\r\nthe watermen\'s wherries, with other boys. On one of these occasions\r\nthere was another boy with me in a wherry, and we went out into the\r\ncurrent of the river: while we were there two more stout boys came to\r\nus in another wherry, and, abusing us for taking the boat, desired me\r\nto get into the other wherry-boat. Accordingly I went to get out of\r\nthe wherry I was in; but just as I had got one of my feet into the\r\nother boat the boys shoved it off, so that I fell into the Thames;\r\nand, not being able to swim, I should unavoidably have been drowned,\r\nbut for the assistance of some watermen who providentially came to my\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThe Namur being again got ready for sea, my master, with his gang, was\r\nordered on board; and, to my no small grief, I was obliged to leave my\r\nschool-master, whom I liked very much, and always attended while I\r\nstayed in London, to repair on board with my master. Nor did I leave\r\nmy kind patronesses, the Miss Guerins, without uneasiness and regret.\r\nThey often used to teach me to read, and took great pains to instruct\r\nme in the principles of religion and the knowledge of God. I therefore\r\nparted from those amiable ladies with reluctance; after receiving from\r\nthem many friendly cautions how to conduct myself, and some valuable\r\npresents.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to Spithead, I found we were destined for the\r\nMediterranean, with a large fleet, which was now ready to put to sea.\r\nWe only waited for the arrival of the admiral, who soon came on board;\r\nand about the beginning of the spring 1759, having weighed anchor, and\r\ngot under way, Sailed for the Mediterranean; and in eleven days, from\r\nthe Land\'s End, we got to Gibraltar. While we were here I used to be\r\noften on shore, and got various fruits in great plenty, and very\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nI had frequently told several people, in my excursions on shore, the\r\nstory of my being kidnapped with my sister, and of our being\r\nseparated, as I have related before; and I had as often expressed my\r\nanxiety for her fate, and my sorrow at having never met her again. One\r\nday, when I was on shore, and mentioning these circumstances to some\r\npersons, one of them told me he knew where my sister was, and, if I\r\nwould accompany him, he would bring me to her. Improbable as this\r\nstory was I believed it immediately, and agreed to go with him, while\r\nmy heart leaped for joy: and, indeed, he conducted me to a black young\r\nwoman, who was so like my sister, that, at first sight, I really\r\nthought it was her: but I was quickly undeceived; and, on talking to\r\nher, I found her to be of another nation.\r\n\r\nWhile we lay here the Preston came in from the Levant. As soon as she\r\narrived, my master told me I should now see my old companion, Dick,\r\nwho had gone in her when she sailed for Turkey. I was much rejoiced at\r\nthis news, and expected every minute to embrace him; and when the\r\ncaptain came on board of our ship, which he did immediately after, I\r\nran to inquire after my friend; but, with inexpressible sorrow, I\r\nlearned from the boat\'s crew that the dear youth was dead! and that\r\nthey had brought his chest, and all his other things, to my master:\r\nthese he afterwards gave to me, and I regarded them as a memorial of\r\nmy friend, whom I loved, and grieved for, as a brother.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at Gibraltar, I saw a soldier hanging by his heels, at\r\none of the moles[L]: I thought this a strange sight, as I had seen a\r\nman hanged in London by his neck. At another time I saw the master of\r\na frigate towed to shore on a grating, by several of the men of war\'s\r\nboats, and discharged the fleet, which I understood was a mark of\r\ndisgrace for cowardice. On board the same ship there was also a sailor\r\nhung up at the yard-arm.\r\n\r\nAfter lying at Gibraltar for some time, we sailed up the Mediterranean\r\na considerable way above the Gulf of Lyons; where we were one night\r\novertaken with a terrible gale of wind, much greater than any I had\r\never yet experienced. The sea ran so high that, though all the guns\r\nwere well housed, there was great reason to fear their getting loose,\r\nthe ship rolled so much; and if they had it must have proved our\r\ndestruction. After we had cruised here for a short time, we came to\r\nBarcelona, a Spanish sea-port, remarkable for its silk manufactures.\r\nHere the ships were all to be watered; and my master, who spoke\r\ndifferent languages, and used often to interpret for the admiral,\r\nsuperintended the watering of ours. For that purpose he and the\r\nofficers of the other ships, who were on the same service, had tents\r\npitched in the bay; and the Spanish soldiers were stationed along the\r\nshore, I suppose to see that no depredations were committed by our\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nI used constantly to attend my master; and I was charmed with this\r\nplace. All the time we stayed it was like a fair with the natives, who\r\nbrought us fruits of all kinds, and sold them to us much cheaper than\r\nI got them in England. They used also to bring wine down to us in hog\r\nand sheep skins, which diverted me very much. The Spanish officers\r\nhere treated our officers with great politeness and attention; and\r\nsome of them, in particular, used to come often to my master\'s tent to\r\nvisit him; where they would sometimes divert themselves by mounting me\r\non the horses or mules, so that I could not fall, and setting them off\r\nat full gallop; my imperfect skill in horsemanship all the while\r\naffording them no small entertainment. After the ships were watered,\r\nwe returned to our old station of cruizing off Toulon, for the purpose\r\nof intercepting a fleet of French men of war that lay there. One\r\nSunday, in our cruise, we came off a place where there were two small\r\nFrench frigates lying in shore; and our admiral, thinking to take or\r\ndestroy them, sent two ships in after them--the Culloden and the\r\nConqueror. They soon came up to the Frenchmen; and I saw a smart fight\r\nhere, both by sea and land: for the frigates were covered by\r\nbatteries, and they played upon our ships most furiously, which they\r\nas furiously returned, and for a long time a constant firing was kept\r\nup on all sides at an amazing rate. At last one frigate sunk; but the\r\npeople escaped, though not without much difficulty: and a little after\r\nsome of the people left the other frigate also, which was a mere\r\nwreck. However, our ships did not venture to bring her away, they were\r\nso much annoyed from the batteries, which raked them both in going and\r\ncoming: their topmasts were shot away, and they were otherwise so much\r\nshattered, that the admiral was obliged to send in many boats to tow\r\nthem back to the fleet. I afterwards sailed with a man who fought in\r\none of the French batteries during the engagement, and he told me our\r\nships had done considerable mischief that day on shore and in the\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nAfter this we sailed for Gibraltar, and arrived there about August\r\n1759. Here we remained with all our sails unbent, while the fleet was\r\nwatering and doing other necessary things. While we were in this\r\nsituation, one day the admiral, with most of the principal officers,\r\nand many people of all stations, being on shore, about seven o\'clock\r\nin the evening we were alarmed by signals from the frigates stationed\r\nfor that purpose; and in an instant there was a general cry that the\r\nFrench fleet was out, and just passing through the streights. The\r\nadmiral immediately came on board with some other officers; and it is\r\nimpossible to describe the noise, hurry and confusion throughout the\r\nwhole fleet, in bending their sails and slipping their cables; many\r\npeople and ships\' boats were left on shore in the bustle. We had two\r\ncaptains on board of our ship who came away in the hurry and left\r\ntheir ships to follow. We shewed lights from the gun-whale to the main\r\ntopmast-head; and all our lieutenants were employed amongst the fleet\r\nto tell the ships not to wait for their captains, but to put the sails\r\nto the yards, slip their cables and follow us; and in this confusion\r\nof making ready for fighting we set out for sea in the dark after the\r\nFrench fleet. Here I could have exclaimed with Ajax,\r\n\r\n    "Oh Jove! O father! if it be thy will\r\n    That we must perish, we thy will obey,\r\n    But let us perish by the light of day."\r\n\r\nThey had got the start of us so far that we were not able to come up\r\nwith them during the night; but at daylight we saw seven sail of the\r\nline of battle some miles ahead. We immediately chased them till about\r\nfour o\'clock in the evening, when our ships came up with them; and,\r\nthough we were about fifteen large ships, our gallant admiral only\r\nfought them with his own division, which consisted of seven; so that\r\nwe were just ship for ship. We passed by the whole of the enemy\'s\r\nfleet in order to come at their commander, Mons. La Clue, who was in\r\nthe Ocean, an eighty-four gun ship: as we passed they all fired on us;\r\nand at one time three of them fired together, continuing to do so for\r\nsome time. Notwithstanding which our admiral would not suffer a gun to\r\nbe fired at any of them, to my astonishment; but made us lie on our\r\nbellies on the deck till we came quite close to the Ocean, who was\r\nahead of them all; when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers\r\ninto her at once.\r\n\r\nThe engagement now commenced with great fury on both sides: the Ocean\r\nimmediately returned our fire, and we continued engaged with each\r\nother for some time; during which I was frequently stunned with the\r\nthundering of the great guns, whose dreadful contents hurried many of\r\nmy companions into awful eternity. At last the French line was\r\nentirely broken, and we obtained the victory, which was immediately\r\nproclaimed with loud huzzas and acclamations. We took three prizes, La\r\nModeste, of sixty-four guns, and Le Temeraire and Centaur, of\r\nseventy-four guns each. The rest of the French ships took to flight\r\nwith all the sail they could crowd. Our ship being very much damaged,\r\nand quite disabled from pursuing the enemy, the admiral immediately\r\nquitted her, and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board\r\nthe Newark, with which, and some other ships, he went after the\r\nFrench. The Ocean, and another large French ship, called the\r\nRedoubtable, endeavouring to escape, ran ashore at Cape Logas, on the\r\ncoast of Portugal; and the French admiral and some of the crew got\r\nashore; but we, finding it impossible to get the ships off, set fire\r\nto them both. About midnight I saw the Ocean blow up, with a most\r\ndreadful explosion. I never beheld a more awful scene. In less than a\r\nminute the midnight for a certain space seemed turned into day by the\r\nblaze, which was attended with a noise louder and more terrible than\r\nthunder, that seemed to rend every element around us.\r\n\r\nMy station during the engagement was on the middle-deck, where I was\r\nquartered with another boy, to bring powder to the aftermost gun; and\r\nhere I was a witness of the dreadful fate of many of my companions,\r\nwho, in the twinkling of an eye, were dashed in pieces, and launched\r\ninto eternity. Happily I escaped unhurt, though the shot and splinters\r\nflew thick about me during the whole fight. Towards the latter part of\r\nit my master was wounded, and I saw him carried down to the surgeon;\r\nbut though I was much alarmed for him and wished to assist him I dared\r\nnot leave my post. At this station my gun-mate (a partner in bringing\r\npowder for the same gun) and I ran a very great risk for more than\r\nhalf an hour of blowing up the ship. For, when we had taken the\r\ncartridges out of the boxes, the bottoms of many of them proving\r\nrotten, the powder ran all about the deck, near the match tub: we\r\nscarcely had water enough at the last to throw on it. We were also,\r\nfrom our employment, very much exposed to the enemy\'s shots; for we\r\nhad to go through nearly the whole length of the ship to bring the\r\npowder. I expected therefore every minute to be my last; especially\r\nwhen I saw our men fall so thick about me; but, wishing to guard as\r\nmuch against the dangers as possible, at first I thought it would be\r\nsafest not to go for the powder till the Frenchmen had fired their\r\nbroadside; and then, while they were charging, I could go and come\r\nwith my powder: but immediately afterwards I thought this caution was\r\nfruitless; and, cheering myself with the reflection that there was a\r\ntime allotted for me to die as well as to be born, I instantly cast\r\noff all fear or thought whatever of death, and went through the whole\r\nof my duty with alacrity; pleasing myself with the hope, if I survived\r\nthe battle, of relating it and the dangers I had escaped to the dear\r\nMiss Guerin, and others, when I should return to London.\r\n\r\nOur ship suffered very much in this engagement; for, besides the\r\nnumber of our killed and wounded, she was almost torn to pieces, and\r\nour rigging so much shattered, that our mizen-mast and main-yard, &c.\r\nhung over the side of the ship; so that we were obliged to get many\r\ncarpenters, and others from some of the ships of the fleet, to assist\r\nin setting us in some tolerable order; and, notwithstanding, it took\r\nus some time before we were completely refitted; after which we left\r\nAdmiral Broderick to command, and we, with the prizes, steered for\r\nEngland. On the passage, and as soon as my master was something\r\nrecovered of his wounds, the admiral appointed him captain of the \xc3\x86tna\r\nfire-ship, on which he and I left the Namur, and went on board of her\r\nat sea. I liked this little ship very much. I now became the captain\'s\r\nsteward, in which situation I was very happy: for I was extremely well\r\ntreated by all on board; and I had leisure to improve myself in\r\nreading and writing. The latter I had learned a little of before I\r\nleft the Namur, as there was a school on board. When we arrived at\r\nSpithead the \xc3\x86tna went into Portsmouth harbour to refit, which being\r\ndone, we returned to Spithead and joined a large fleet that was\r\nthought to be intended against the Havannah; but about that time the\r\nking died: whether that prevented the expedition I know not; but it\r\ncaused our ship to be stationed at Cowes, in the isle of Wight, till\r\nthe beginning of the year sixty-one. Here I spent my time very\r\npleasantly; I was much on shore all about this delightful island, and\r\nfound the inhabitants very civil.\r\n\r\nWhile I was here, I met with a trifling incident, which surprised me\r\nagreeably. I was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had\r\na black boy about my own size; this boy having observed me from his\r\nmaster\'s house, was transported at the sight of one of his own\r\ncountrymen, and ran to meet me with the utmost haste. I not knowing\r\nwhat he was about turned a little out of his way at first, but to no\r\npurpose: he soon came close to me and caught hold of me in his arms as\r\nif I had been his brother, though we had never seen each other before.\r\nAfter we had talked together for some time he took me to his master\'s\r\nhouse, where I was treated very kindly. This benevolent boy and I were\r\nvery happy in frequently seeing each other till about the month of\r\nMarch 1761, when our ship had orders to fit out again for another\r\nexpedition. When we got ready, we joined a very large fleet at\r\nSpithead, commanded by Commodore Keppel, which was destined against\r\nBelle-Isle, and with a number of transport ships with troops on board\r\nto make a descent on the place. We sailed once more in quest of fame.\r\nI longed to engage in new adventures and see fresh wonders.\r\n\r\nI had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impression,\r\nand every event which I considered as marvellous. Every extraordinary\r\nescape, or signal deliverance, either of myself or others, I looked\r\nupon to be effected by the interposition of Providence. We had not\r\nbeen above ten days at sea before an incident of this kind happened;\r\nwhich, whatever credit it may obtain from the reader, made no small\r\nimpression on my mind.\r\n\r\nWe had on board a gunner, whose name was John Mondle; a man of very\r\nindifferent morals. This man\'s cabin was between the decks, exactly\r\nover where I lay, abreast of the quarter-deck ladder. One night, the\r\n20th of April, being terrified with a dream, he awoke in so great a\r\nfright that he could not rest in his bed any longer, nor even remain\r\nin his cabin; and he went upon deck about four o\'clock in the morning\r\nextremely agitated. He immediately told those on the deck of the\r\nagonies of his mind, and the dream which occasioned it; in which he\r\nsaid he had seen many things very awful, and had been warned by St.\r\nPeter to repent, who told him time was short. This he said had greatly\r\nalarmed him, and he was determined to alter his life. People generally\r\nmock the fears of others when they are themselves in safety; and some\r\nof his shipmates who heard him only laughed at him. However, he made\r\na vow that he never would drink strong liquors again; and he\r\nimmediately got a light, and gave away his sea-stores of liquor. After\r\nwhich, his agitation still continuing, he began to read the\r\nScriptures, hoping to find some relief; and soon afterwards he laid\r\nhimself down again on his bed, and endeavoured to compose himself to\r\nsleep, but to no purpose; his mind still continuing in a state of\r\nagony. By this time it was exactly half after seven in the morning: I\r\nwas then under the half-deck at the great cabin door; and all at once\r\nI heard the people in the waist cry out, most fearfully--\'The Lord\r\nhave mercy upon us! We are all lost! The Lord have mercy upon us!\' Mr.\r\nMondle hearing the cries, immediately ran out of his cabin; and we\r\nwere instantly struck by the Lynne, a forty-gun ship, Captain Clark,\r\nwhich nearly ran us down. This ship had just put about, and was by the\r\nwind, but had not got full headway, or we must all have perished; for\r\nthe wind was brisk. However, before Mr. Mondle had got four steps from\r\nhis cabin-door, she struck our ship with her cutwater right in the\r\nmiddle of his bed and cabin, and ran it up to the combings of the\r\nquarter-deck hatchway, and above three feet below water, and in a\r\nminute there was not a bit of wood to be seen where Mr. Mondle\'s cabin\r\nstood; and he was so near being killed that some of the splinters tore\r\nhis face. As Mr. Mondle must inevitably have perished from this\r\naccident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way I have\r\nrelated, I could not help regarding this as an awful interposition of\r\nProvidence for his preservation. The two ships for some time swinged\r\nalongside of each other; for ours being a fire-ship, our\r\ngrappling-irons caught the Lynne every way, and the yards and rigging\r\nwent at an astonishing rate. Our ship was in such a shocking condition\r\nthat we all thought she would instantly go down, and every one ran for\r\ntheir lives, and got as well as they could on board the Lynne; but our\r\nlieutenant being the aggressor, he never quitted the ship. However,\r\nwhen we found she did not sink immediately, the captain came on board\r\nagain, and encouraged our people to return and try to save her. Many\r\non this came back, but some would not venture. Some of the ships in\r\nthe fleet, seeing our situation, immediately sent their boats to our\r\nassistance; but it took us the whole day to save the ship with all\r\ntheir help. And by using every possible means, particularly frapping\r\nher together with many hawsers, and putting a great quantity of tallow\r\nbelow water where she was damaged, she was kept together: but it was\r\nwell we did not meet with any gales of wind, or we must have gone to\r\npieces; for we were in such a crazy condition that we had ships to\r\nattend us till we arrived at Belle-Isle, the place of our destination;\r\nand then we had all things taken out of the ship, and she was properly\r\nrepaired. This escape of Mr. Mondle, which he, as well as myself,\r\nalways considered as a singular act of Providence, I believe had a\r\ngreat influence on his life and conduct ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nNow that I am on this subject I beg leave to relate another instance\r\nor two which strongly raised my belief of the particular interposition\r\nof Heaven, and which might not otherwise have found a place here, from\r\ntheir insignificance. I belonged for a few days in the year 1758 to\r\nthe Jason, of fifty-four guns, at Plymouth; and one night, when I was\r\non board, a woman, with a child at her breast, fell from the\r\nupper-deck down into the hold, near the keel. Every one thought that\r\nthe mother and child must be both dashed to pieces; but, to our great\r\nsurprise, neither of them was hurt. I myself one day fell headlong\r\nfrom the upper-deck of the \xc3\x86tna down the after-hold, when the ballast\r\nwas out; and all who saw me fall cried out I was killed: but I\r\nreceived not the least injury. And in the same ship a man fell from\r\nthe mast-head on the deck without being hurt. In these, and in many\r\nmore instances, I thought I could plainly trace the hand of God,\r\nwithout whose permission a sparrow cannot fall. I began to raise my\r\nfear from man to him alone, and to call daily on his holy name with\r\nfear and reverence: and I trust he heard my supplications, and\r\ngraciously condescended to answer me according to his holy word, and\r\nto implant the seeds of piety in me, even one of the meanest of his\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nWhen we had refitted our ship, and all things were in readiness for\r\nattacking the place, the troops on board the transports were ordered\r\nto disembark; and my master, as a junior captain, had a share in the\r\ncommand of the landing. This was on the 8th of April. The French were\r\ndrawn up on the shore, and had made every disposition to oppose the\r\nlanding of our men, only a small part of them this day being able to\r\neffect it; most of them, after fighting with great bravery, were cut\r\noff; and General Crawford, with a number of others, were taken\r\nprisoners. In this day\'s engagement we had also our lieutenant killed.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of April we renewed our efforts to land the men, while all\r\nthe men of war were stationed along the shore to cover it, and fired\r\nat the French batteries and breastworks from early in the morning till\r\nabout four o\'clock in the evening, when our soldiers effected a safe\r\nlanding. They immediately attacked the French; and, after a sharp\r\nencounter, forced them from the batteries. Before the enemy retreated\r\nthey blew up several of them, lest they should fall into our hands.\r\nOur men now proceeded to besiege the citadel, and my master was\r\nordered on shore to superintend the landing of all the materials\r\nnecessary for carrying on the siege; in which service I mostly\r\nattended him. While I was there I went about to different parts of the\r\nisland; and one day, particularly, my curiosity almost cost me my\r\nlife. I wanted very much to see the mode of charging the mortars and\r\nletting off the shells, and for that purpose I went to an English\r\nbattery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel.\r\nThere, indeed, I had an opportunity of completely gratifying myself in\r\nseeing the whole operation, and that not without running a very great\r\nrisk, both from the English shells that burst while I was there, but\r\nlikewise from those of the French. One of the largest of their shells\r\nbursted within nine or ten yards of me: there was a single rock close\r\nby, about the size of a butt; and I got instant shelter under it in\r\ntime to avoid the fury of the shell. Where it burst the earth was torn\r\nin such a manner that two or three butts might easily have gone into\r\nthe hole it made, and it threw great quantities of stones and dirt to\r\na considerable distance. Three shot were also fired at me and another\r\nboy who was along with me, one of them in particular seemed\r\n\r\n    "Wing\'d with red lightning and impetuous rage;"\r\n\r\nfor with a most dreadful sound it hissed close by me, and struck a\r\nrock at a little distance, which it shattered to pieces. When I saw\r\nwhat perilous circumstances I was in, I attempted to return the\r\nnearest way I could find, and thereby I got between the English and\r\nthe French centinels. An English serjeant, who commanded the outposts,\r\nseeing me, and surprised how I came there, (which was by stealth along\r\nthe seashore), reprimanded me very severely for it, and instantly took\r\nthe centinel off his post into custody, for his negligence in\r\nsuffering me to pass the lines. While I was in this situation I\r\nobserved at a little distance a French horse, belonging to some\r\nislanders, which I thought I would now mount, for the greater\r\nexpedition of getting off. Accordingly I took some cord which I had\r\nabout me, and making a kind of bridle of it, I put it round the\r\nhorse\'s head, and the tame beast very quietly suffered me to tie him\r\nthus and mount him. As soon as I was on the horse\'s back I began to\r\nkick and beat him, and try every means to make him go quick, but all\r\nto very little purpose: I could not drive him out of a slow pace.\r\nWhile I was creeping along, still within reach of the enemy\'s shot, I\r\nmet with a servant well mounted on an English horse. I immediately\r\nstopped; and, crying, told him my case; and begged of him to help me,\r\nand this he effectually did; for, having a fine large whip, he began\r\nto lash my horse with it so severely, that he set off full speed with\r\nme towards the sea, while I was quite unable to hold or manage him. In\r\nthis manner I went along till I came to a craggy precipice. I now\r\ncould not stop my horse; and my mind was filled with apprehensions of\r\nmy deplorable fate should he go down the precipice, which he appeared\r\nfully disposed to do: I therefore thought I had better throw myself\r\noff him at once, which I did immediately with a great deal of\r\ndexterity, and fortunately escaped unhurt. As soon as I found myself\r\nat liberty I made the best of my way for the ship, determined I would\r\nnot be so fool-hardy again in a hurry.\r\n\r\nWe continued to besiege the citadel till June, when it surrendered.\r\nDuring the siege I have counted above sixty shells and carcases in the\r\nair at once. When this place was taken I went through the citadel, and\r\nin the bomb-proofs under it, which were cut in the solid rock; and I\r\nthought it a surprising place, both for strength and building:\r\nnotwithstanding which our shots and shells had made amazing\r\ndevastation, and ruinous heaps all around it.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of this island our ships, with some others commanded\r\nby Commodore Stanhope in the Swiftsure, went to Basse-road, where we\r\nblocked up a French fleet. Our ships were there from June till\r\nFebruary following; and in that time I saw a great many scenes of war,\r\nand stratagems on both sides to destroy each others fleet. Sometimes\r\nwe would attack the French with some ships of the line; at other times\r\nwith boats; and frequently we made prizes. Once or twice the French\r\nattacked us by throwing shells with their bomb-vessels: and one day as\r\na French vessel was throwing shells at our ships she broke from her\r\nsprings, behind the isle of I de Re: the tide being complicated, she\r\ncame within a gun shot of the Nassau; but the Nassau could not bring a\r\ngun to bear upon her, and thereby the Frenchman got off. We were twice\r\nattacked by their fire-floats, which they chained together, and then\r\nlet them float down with the tide; but each time we sent boats with\r\ngraplings, and towed them safe out of the fleet.\r\n\r\nWe had different commanders while we were at this place, Commodores\r\nStanhope, Dennis, Lord Howe, &c. From hence, before the Spanish war\r\nbegan, our ship and the Wasp sloop were sent to St. Sebastian in\r\nSpain, by Commodore Stanhope; and Commodore Dennis afterwards sent our\r\nship as a cartel to Bayonne in France[M], after which[N] we went in\r\nFebruary in 1762 to Belle-Isle, and there stayed till the summer, when\r\nwe left it, and returned to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nAfter our ship was fitted out again for service, in September she went\r\nto Guernsey, where I was very glad to see my old hostess, who was now\r\na widow, and my former little charming companion, her daughter. I\r\nspent some time here very happily with them, till October, when we had\r\norders to repair to Portsmouth. We parted from each other with a great\r\ndeal of affection; and I promised to return soon, and see them again,\r\nnot knowing what all-powerful fate had determined for me. Our ship\r\nhaving arrived at Portsmouth, we went into the harbour, and remained\r\nthere till the latter end of November, when we heard great talk about\r\npeace; and, to our very great joy, in the beginning of December we had\r\norders to go up to London with our ship to be paid off. We received\r\nthis news with loud huzzas, and every other demonstration of gladness;\r\nand nothing but mirth was to be seen throughout every part of the\r\nship. I too was not without my share of the general joy on this\r\noccasion. I thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for\r\nmyself, and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good\r\neducation; for I always had a great desire to be able at least to read\r\nand write; and while I was on shipboard I had endeavoured to improve\r\nmyself in both. While I was in the \xc3\x86tna particularly, the captain\'s\r\nclerk taught me to write, and gave me a smattering of arithmetic as\r\nfar as the rule of three. There was also one Daniel Queen, about forty\r\nyears of age, a man very well educated, who messed with me on board\r\nthis ship, and he likewise dressed and attended the captain.\r\nFortunately this man soon became very much attached to me, and took\r\nvery great pains to instruct me in many things. He taught me to shave\r\nand dress hair a little, and also to read in the Bible, explaining\r\nmany passages to me, which I did not comprehend. I was wonderfully\r\nsurprised to see the laws and rules of my country written almost\r\nexactly here; a circumstance which I believe tended to impress our\r\nmanners and customs more deeply on my memory. I used to tell him of\r\nthis resemblance; and many a time we have sat up the whole night\r\ntogether at this employment. In short, he was like a father to me; and\r\nsome even used to call me after his name; they also styled me the\r\nblack Christian. Indeed I almost loved him with the affection of a\r\nson. Many things I have denied myself that he might have them; and\r\nwhen I used to play at marbles or any other game, and won a few\r\nhalf-pence, or got any little money, which I sometimes did, for\r\nshaving any one, I used to buy him a little sugar or tobacco, as far\r\nas my stock of money would go. He used to say, that he and I never\r\nshould part; and that when our ship was paid off, as I was as free as\r\nhimself or any other man on board, he would instruct me in his\r\nbusiness, by which I might gain a good livelihood. This gave me new\r\nlife and spirits; and my heart burned within me, while I thought the\r\ntime long till I obtained my freedom. For though my master had not\r\npromised it to me, yet, besides the assurances I had received that he\r\nhad no right to detain me, he always treated me with the greatest\r\nkindness, and reposed in me an unbounded confidence; he even paid\r\nattention to my morals; and would never suffer me to deceive him, or\r\ntell lies, of which he used to tell me the consequences; and that if I\r\ndid so God would not love me; so that, from all this tenderness, I had\r\nnever once supposed, in all my dreams of freedom, that he would think\r\nof detaining me any longer than I wished.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of our orders we sailed from Portsmouth for the Thames,\r\nand arrived at Deptford the 10th of December, where we cast anchor\r\njust as it was high water. The ship was up about half an hour, when my\r\nmaster ordered the barge to be manned; and all in an instant, without\r\nhaving before given me the least reason to suspect any thing of the\r\nmatter, he forced me into the barge; saying, I was going to leave him,\r\nbut he would take care I should not. I was so struck with the\r\nunexpectedness of this proceeding, that for some time I did not make a\r\nreply, only I made an offer to go for my books and chest of clothes,\r\nbut he swore I should not move out of his sight; and if I did he would\r\ncut my throat, at the same time taking his hanger. I began, however,\r\nto collect myself; and, plucking up courage, I told him I was free,\r\nand he could not by law serve me so. But this only enraged him the\r\nmore; and he continued to swear, and said he would soon let me know\r\nwhether he would or not, and at that instant sprung himself into the\r\nbarge from the ship, to the astonishment and sorrow of all on board.\r\nThe tide, rather unluckily for me, had just turned downward, so that\r\nwe quickly fell down the river along with it, till we came among some\r\noutward-bound West Indiamen; for he was resolved to put me on board\r\nthe first vessel he could get to receive me. The boat\'s crew, who\r\npulled against their will, became quite faint different times, and\r\nwould have gone ashore; but he would not let them. Some of them strove\r\nthen to cheer me, and told me he could not sell me, and that they\r\nwould stand by me, which revived me a little; and I still entertained\r\nhopes; for as they pulled along he asked some vessels to receive me,\r\nbut they could not. But, just as we had got a little below Gravesend,\r\nwe came alongside of a ship which was going away the next tide for the\r\nWest Indies; her name was the Charming Sally, Captain James Doran; and\r\nmy master went on board and agreed with him for me; and in a little\r\ntime I was sent for into the cabin. When I came there Captain Doran\r\nasked me if I knew him; I answered that I did not; \'Then,\' said he\r\n\'you are now my slave.\' I told him my master could not sell me to him,\r\nnor to any one else. \'Why,\' said he,\'did not your master buy you?\' I\r\nconfessed he did. \'But I have served him,\' said I,\'many years, and he\r\nhas taken all my wages and prize-money, for I only got one sixpence\r\nduring the war; besides this I have been baptized; and by the laws of\r\nthe land no man has a right to sell me:\' And I added, that I had heard\r\na lawyer and others at different times tell my master so. They both\r\nthen said that those people who told me so were not my friends; but I\r\nreplied--it was very extraordinary that other people did not know the\r\nlaw as well as they. Upon this Captain Doran said I talked too much\r\nEnglish; and if I did not behave myself well, and be quiet, he had a\r\nmethod on board to make me. I was too well convinced of his power over\r\nme to doubt what he said; and my former sufferings in the slave-ship\r\npresenting themselves to my mind, the recollection of them made me\r\nshudder. However, before I retired I told them that as I could not get\r\nany right among men here I hoped I should hereafter in Heaven; and I\r\nimmediately left the cabin, filled with resentment and sorrow. The\r\nonly coat I had with me my master took away with him, and said if my\r\nprize-money had been 10,000 \xc2\xa3. he had a right to it all, and would have\r\ntaken it. I had about nine guineas, which, during my long sea-faring\r\nlife, I had scraped together from trifling perquisites and little\r\nventures; and I hid it that instant, lest my master should take that\r\nfrom me likewise, still hoping that by some means or other I should\r\nmake my escape to the shore; and indeed some of my old shipmates told\r\nme not to despair, for they would get me back again; and that, as soon\r\nas they could get their pay, they would immediately come to Portsmouth\r\nto me, where this ship was going: but, alas! all my hopes were\r\nbaffled, and the hour of my deliverance was yet far off. My master,\r\nhaving soon concluded his bargain with the captain, came out of the\r\ncabin, and he and his people got into the boat and put off; I followed\r\nthem with aching eyes as long as I could, and when they were out of\r\nsight I threw myself on the deck, while my heart was ready to burst\r\nwith sorrow and anguish.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: He had drowned himself in endeavouring to desert.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: Among others whom we brought from Bayonne, two gentlemen,\r\nwho had been in the West Indies, where they sold slaves; and they\r\nconfessed they had made at one time a false bill of sale, and sold two\r\nPortuguese white men among a lot of slaves.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: Some people have it, that sometimes shortly before\r\npersons die their ward has been seen; that is, some spirit exactly in\r\ntheir likeness, though they are themselves at other places at the same\r\ntime.

I wept very\r\nbitterly for some time: and began to think that I must have done\r\nsomething to displease the Lord, that he thus punished me so severely.\r\nThis filled me with painful reflections on my past conduct; I\r\nrecollected that on the morning of our arrival at Deptford I had\r\nrashly sworn that as soon as we reached London I would spend the day\r\nin rambling and sport. My conscience smote me for this unguarded\r\nexpression: I felt that the Lord was able to disappoint me in all\r\nthings, and immediately considered my present situation as a judgment\r\nof Heaven on account of my presumption in swearing: I therefore, with\r\ncontrition of heart, acknowledged my transgression to God, and poured\r\nout my soul before him with unfeigned repentance, and with earnest\r\nsupplications I besought him not to abandon me in my distress, nor\r\ncast me from his mercy for ever. In a little time my grief, spent with\r\nits own violence, began to subside; and after the first confusion of\r\nmy thoughts was over I reflected with more calmness on my present\r\ncondition: I considered that trials and disappointments are sometimes\r\nfor our good, and I thought God might perhaps have permitted this in\r\norder to teach me wisdom and resignation; for he had hitherto shadowed\r\nme with the wings of his mercy, and by his invisible but powerful hand\r\nbrought me the way I knew not. These reflections gave me a little\r\ncomfort, and I rose at last from the deck with dejection and sorrow in\r\nmy countenance, yet mixed with some faint hope that the _Lord would\r\nappear_ for my deliverance.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, as my new master was going ashore, he called me to\r\nhim, and told me to behave myself well, and do the business of the\r\nship the same as any of the rest of the boys, and that I should fare\r\nthe better for it; but I made him no answer. I was then asked if I\r\ncould swim, and I said, No. However I was made to go under the deck,\r\nand was well watched. The next tide the ship got under way, and soon\r\nafter arrived at the Mother Bank, Portsmouth; where she waited a few\r\ndays for some of the West India convoy. While I was here I tried every\r\nmeans I could devise amongst the people of the ship to get me a boat\r\nfrom the shore, as there was none suffered to come alongside of the\r\nship; and their own, whenever it was used, was hoisted in again\r\nimmediately. A sailor on board took a guinea from me on pretence of\r\ngetting me a boat; and promised me, time after time, that it was\r\nhourly to come off. When he had the watch upon deck I watched also;\r\nand looked long enough, but all in vain; I could never see either the\r\nboat or my guinea again. And what I thought was still the worst of\r\nall, the fellow gave information, as I afterwards found, all the while\r\nto the mates, of my intention to go off, if I could in any way do it;\r\nbut, rogue like, he never told them he had got a guinea from me to\r\nprocure my escape. However, after we had sailed, and his trick was\r\nmade known to the ship\'s crew, I had some satisfaction in seeing him\r\ndetested and despised by them all for his behaviour to me. I was still\r\nin hopes that my old shipmates would not forget their promise to come\r\nfor me to Portsmouth: and, indeed, at last, but not till the day\r\nbefore we sailed, some of them did come there, and sent me off some\r\noranges, and other tokens of their regard. They also sent me word they\r\nwould come off to me themselves the next day or the day after; and a\r\nlady also, who lived in Gosport, wrote to me that she would come and\r\ntake me out of the ship at the same time. This lady had been once very\r\nintimate with my former master: I used to sell and take care of a\r\ngreat deal of property for her, in different ships; and in return she\r\nalways shewed great friendship for me, and used to tell my master that\r\nshe would take me away to live with her: but, unfortunately for me, a\r\ndisagreement soon afterwards took place between them; and she was\r\nsucceeded in my master\'s good graces by another lady, who appeared\r\nsole mistress of the \xc3\x86tna, and mostly lodged on board. I was not so\r\ngreat a favourite with this lady as with the former; she had conceived\r\na pique against me on some occasion when she was on board, and she did\r\nnot fail to instigate my master to treat me in the manner he did[O].\r\n\r\nHowever, the next morning, the 30th of December, the wind being brisk\r\nand easterly, the Oeolus frigate, which was to escort the convoy,\r\nmade a signal for sailing. All the ships then got up their anchors;\r\nand, before any of my friends had an opportunity to come off to my\r\nrelief, to my inexpressible anguish our ship had got under way. What\r\ntumultuous emotions agitated my soul when the convoy got under sail,\r\nand I a prisoner on board, now without hope! I kept my swimming eyes\r\nupon the land in a state of unutterable grief; not knowing what to do,\r\nand despairing how to help myself. While my mind was in this situation\r\nthe fleet sailed on, and in one day\'s time I lost sight of the\r\nwished-for land. In the first expressions of my grief I reproached my\r\nfate, and wished I had never been born. I was ready to curse the tide\r\nthat bore us, the gale that wafted my prison, and even the ship that\r\nconducted us; and I called on death to relieve me from the horrors I\r\nfelt and dreaded, that I might be in that place\r\n\r\n    "Where slaves are free, and men oppress no more.\r\n    Fool that I was, inur\'d so long to pain,\r\n    To trust to hope, or dream of joy again.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Now dragg\'d once more beyond the western main,\r\n    To groan beneath some dastard planter\'s chain;\r\n    Where my poor countrymen in bondage wait\r\n    The long enfranchisement of ling\'ring fate:\r\n    Hard ling\'ring fate! while, ere the dawn of day,\r\n    Rous\'d by the lash they go their cheerless way;\r\n    And as their souls with shame and anguish burn,\r\n    Salute with groans unwelcome morn\'s return,\r\n    And, chiding ev\'ry hour the slow-pac\'d sun,\r\n    Pursue their toils till all his race is run.\r\n    No eye to mark their suff\'rings with a tear;\r\n    No friend to comfort, and no hope to cheer:\r\n    Then, like the dull unpity\'d brutes, repair\r\n    To stalls as wretched, and as coarse a fare;\r\n    Thank heaven one day of mis\'ry was o\'er,\r\n    Then sink to sleep, and wish to wake no more[P]."\r\n\r\nThe turbulence of my emotions however naturally gave way to calmer\r\nthoughts, and I soon perceived what fate had decreed no mortal on\r\nearth could prevent. The convoy sailed on without any accident, with a\r\npleasant gale and smooth sea, for six weeks, till February, when one\r\nmorning the Oeolus ran down a brig, one of the convoy, and she\r\ninstantly went down and was ingulfed in the dark recesses of the\r\nocean. The convoy was immediately thrown into great confusion till it\r\nwas daylight; and the Oeolus was illumined with lights to prevent\r\nany farther mischief. On the 13th of February 1763, from the\r\nmast-head, we descried our destined island Montserrat; and soon after\r\nI beheld those\r\n\r\n    "Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\r\n    And rest can rarely dwell. Hope never comes\r\n    That comes to all, but torture without end\r\n    Still urges."\r\n\r\nAt the sight of this land of bondage, a fresh horror ran through all\r\nmy frame, and chilled me to the heart. My former slavery now rose in\r\ndreadful review to my mind, and displayed nothing but misery, stripes,\r\nand chains; and, in the first paroxysm of my grief, I called upon\r\nGod\'s thunder, and his avenging power, to direct the stroke of death\r\nto me, rather than permit me to become a slave, and be sold from lord\r\nto lord.\r\n\r\nIn this state of my mind our ship came to an anchor, and soon after\r\ndischarged her cargo. I now knew what it was to work hard; I was made\r\nto help to unload and load the ship. And, to comfort me in my distress\r\nin that time, two of the sailors robbed me of all my money, and ran\r\naway from the ship. I had been so long used to an European climate\r\nthat at first I felt the scorching West India sun very painful, while\r\nthe dashing surf would toss the boat and the people in it frequently\r\nabove high water mark. Sometimes our limbs were broken with this, or\r\neven attended with instant death, and I was day by day mangled and\r\ntorn.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May, when the ship was got ready to sail for\r\nEngland, I all the time believing that Fate\'s blackest clouds were\r\ngathering over my head, and expecting their bursting would mix me with\r\nthe dead, Captain Doran sent for me ashore one morning, and I was told\r\nby the messenger that my fate was then determined. With fluttering\r\nsteps and trembling heart I came to the captain, and found with him\r\none Mr. Robert King, a quaker, and the first merchant in the place.\r\nThe captain then told me my former master had sent me there to be\r\nsold; but that he had desired him to get me the best master he could,\r\nas he told him I was a very deserving boy, which Captain Doran said he\r\nfound to be true; and if he were to stay in the West Indies he would\r\nbe glad to keep me himself; but he could not venture to take me to\r\nLondon, for he was very sure that when I came there I would leave him.\r\nI at that instant burst out a crying, and begged much of him to take\r\nme to England with him, but all to no purpose. He told me he had got\r\nme the very best master in the whole island, with whom I should be as\r\nhappy as if I were in England, and for that reason he chose to let him\r\nhave me, though he could sell me to his own brother-in-law for a great\r\ndeal more money than what he got from this gentleman. Mr. King, my new\r\nmaster, then made a reply, and said the reason he had bought me was on\r\naccount of my good character; and, as he had not the least doubt of my\r\ngood behaviour, I should be very well off with him. He also told me he\r\ndid not live in the West Indies, but at Philadelphia, where he was\r\ngoing soon; and, as I understood something of the rules of\r\narithmetic, when we got there he would put me to school, and fit me\r\nfor a clerk. This conversation relieved my mind a little, and I left\r\nthose gentlemen considerably more at ease in myself than when I came\r\nto them; and I was very grateful to Captain Doran, and even to my old\r\nmaster, for the character they had given me; a character which I\r\nafterwards found of infinite service to me. I went on board again, and\r\ntook leave of all my shipmates; and the next day the ship sailed. When\r\nshe weighed anchor I went to the waterside and looked at her with a\r\nvery wishful and aching heart, and followed her with my eyes and tears\r\nuntil she was totally out of sight. I was so bowed down with grief\r\nthat I could not hold up my head for many months; and if my new master\r\nhad not been kind to me I believe I should have died under it at last.\r\nAnd indeed I soon found that he fully deserved the good character\r\nwhich Captain Doran had given me of him; for he possessed a most\r\namiable disposition and temper, and was very charitable and humane. If\r\nany of his slaves behaved amiss he did not beat or use them ill, but\r\nparted with them. This made them afraid of disobliging him; and as he\r\ntreated his slaves better than any other man on the island, so he was\r\nbetter and more faithfully served by them in return. By his kind\r\ntreatment I did at last endeavour to compose myself; and with\r\nfortitude, though moneyless, determined to face whatever fate had\r\ndecreed for me. Mr. King soon asked me what I could do; and at the\r\nsame time said he did not mean to treat me as a common slave. I told\r\nhim I knew something of seamanship, and could shave and dress hair\r\npretty well; and I could refine wines, which I had learned on\r\nshipboard, where I had often done it; and that I could write, and\r\nunderstood arithmetic tolerably well as far as the Rule of Three. He\r\nthen asked me if I knew any thing of gauging; and, on my answering\r\nthat I did not, he said one of his clerks should teach me to gauge.\r\n\r\nMr. King dealt in all manner of merchandize, and kept from one to six\r\nclerks. He loaded many vessels in a year; particularly to\r\nPhiladelphia, where he was born, and was connected with a great\r\nmercantile house in that city. He had besides many vessels and\r\ndroggers, of different sizes, which used to go about the island; and\r\nothers to collect rum, sugar, and other goods. I understood pulling\r\nand managing those boats very well; and this hard work, which was the\r\nfirst that he set me to, in the sugar seasons used to be my constant\r\nemployment. I have rowed the boat, and slaved at the oars, from one\r\nhour to sixteen in the twenty-four; during which I had fifteen pence\r\nsterling per day to live on, though sometimes only ten pence. However\r\nthis was considerably more than was allowed to other slaves that used\r\nto work with me, and belonged to other gentlemen on the island: those\r\npoor souls had never more than nine pence per day, and seldom more\r\nthan six pence, from their masters or owners, though they earned them\r\nthree or four pisterines[Q]: for it is a common practice in the West\r\nIndies for men to purchase slaves though they have not plantations\r\nthemselves, in order to let them out to planters and merchants at so\r\nmuch a piece by the day, and they give what allowance they chuse out\r\nof this produce of their daily work to their slaves for subsistence;\r\nthis allowance is often very scanty. My master often gave the owners\r\nof these slaves two and a half of these pieces per day, and found the\r\npoor fellows in victuals himself, because he thought their owners did\r\nnot feed them well enough according to the work they did. The slaves\r\nused to like this very well; and, as they knew my master to be a man\r\nof feeling, they were always glad to work for him in preference to any\r\nother gentleman; some of whom, after they had been paid for these poor\r\npeople\'s labours, would not give them their allowance out of it. Many\r\ntimes have I even seen these unfortunate wretches beaten for asking\r\nfor their pay; and often severely flogged by their owners if they did\r\nnot bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time; though\r\nthe poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had\r\nworked for sometimes for more than half the day before they could get\r\ntheir pay; and this generally on Sundays, when they wanted the time\r\nfor themselves. In particular, I knew a countryman of mine who once\r\ndid not bring the weekly money directly that it was earned; and though\r\nhe brought it the same day to his master, yet he was staked to the\r\nground for this pretended negligence, and was just going to receive a\r\nhundred lashes, but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty. This\r\npoor man was very industrious; and, by his frugality, had saved so\r\nmuch money by working on shipboard, that he had got a white man to buy\r\nhim a boat, unknown to his master. Some time after he had this little\r\nestate the governor wanted a boat to bring his sugar from different\r\nparts of the island; and, knowing this to be a negro-man\'s boat, he\r\nseized upon it for himself, and would not pay the owner a farthing.\r\nThe man on this went to his master, and complained to him of this act\r\nof the governor; but the only satisfaction he received was to be\r\ndamned very heartily by his master, who asked him how dared any of his\r\nnegroes to have a boat. If the justly-merited ruin of the governor\'s\r\nfortune could be any gratification to the poor man he had thus robbed,\r\nhe was not without consolation. Extortion and rapine are poor\r\nproviders; and some time after this the governor died in the King\'s\r\nBench in England, as I was told, in great poverty. The last war\r\nfavoured this poor negro-man, and he found some means to escape from\r\nhis Christian master: he came to England; where I saw him afterwards\r\nseveral times. Such treatment as this often drives these miserable\r\nwretches to despair, and they run away from their masters at the\r\nhazard of their lives. Many of them, in this place, unable to get\r\ntheir pay when they have earned it, and fearing to be flogged, as\r\nusual, if they return home without it, run away where they can for\r\nshelter, and a reward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive.\r\nMy master used sometimes, in these cases, to agree with their owners,\r\nand to settle with them himself; and thereby he saved many of them a\r\nflogging.\r\n\r\nOnce, for a few days, I was let out to fit a vessel, and I had no\r\nvictuals allowed me by either party; at last I told my master of this\r\ntreatment, and he took me away from it. In many of the estates, on the\r\ndifferent islands where I used to be sent for rum or sugar, they would\r\nnot deliver it to me, or any other negro; he was therefore obliged to\r\nsend a white man along with me to those places; and then he used to\r\npay him from six to ten pisterines a day. From being thus employed,\r\nduring the time I served Mr. King, in going about the different\r\nestates on the island, I had all the opportunity I could wish for to\r\nsee the dreadful usage of the poor men; usage that reconciled me to my\r\nsituation, and made me bless God for the hands into which I had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to please my master in every department in\r\nwhich he employed me; and there was scarcely any part of his business,\r\nor household affairs, in which I was not occasionally engaged. I often\r\nsupplied the place of a clerk, in receiving and delivering cargoes to\r\nthe ships, in tending stores, and delivering goods: and, besides this,\r\nI used to shave and dress my master when convenient, and take care of\r\nhis horse; and when it was necessary, which was very often, I worked\r\nlikewise on board of different vessels of his. By these means I became\r\nvery useful to my master; and saved him, as he used to acknowledge,\r\nabove a hundred pounds a year. Nor did he scruple to say I was of more\r\nadvantage to him than any of his clerks; though their usual wages in\r\nthe West Indies are from sixty to a hundred pounds current a year.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes heard it asserted that a negro cannot earn his master\r\nthe first cost; but nothing can be further from the truth. I suppose\r\nnine tenths of the mechanics throughout the West Indies are negro\r\nslaves; and I well know the coopers among them earn two dollars a day;\r\nthe carpenters the same, and oftentimes more; as also the masons,\r\nsmiths, and fishermen, &c. and I have known many slaves whose masters\r\nwould not take a thousand pounds current for them. But surely this\r\nassertion refutes itself; for, if it be true, why do the planters and\r\nmerchants pay such a price for slaves? And, above all, why do those\r\nwho make this assertion exclaim the most loudly against the abolition\r\nof the slave trade? So much are men blinded, and to such inconsistent\r\narguments are they driven by mistaken interest! I grant, indeed, that\r\nslaves are some times, by half-feeding, half-clothing, over-working\r\nand stripes, reduced so low, that they are turned out as unfit for\r\nservice, and left to perish in the woods, or expire on a dunghill.\r\n\r\nMy master was several times offered by different gentlemen one hundred\r\nguineas for me; but he always told them he would not sell me, to my\r\ngreat joy: and I used to double my diligence and care for fear of\r\ngetting into the hands of those men who did not allow a valuable slave\r\nthe common support of life. Many of them even used to find fault with\r\nmy master for feeding his slaves so well as he did; although I often\r\nwent hungry, and an Englishman might think my fare very indifferent;\r\nbut he used to tell them he always would do it, because the slaves\r\nthereby looked better and did more work.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus employed by my master I was often a witness to\r\ncruelties of every kind, which were exercised on my unhappy fellow\r\nslaves. I used frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in\r\nmy care for sale; and it was almost a constant practice with our\r\nclerks, and other whites, to commit violent depredations on the\r\nchastity of the female slaves; and these I was, though with\r\nreluctance, obliged to submit to at all times, being unable to help\r\nthem. When we have had some of these slaves on board my master\'s\r\nvessels to carry them to other islands, or to America, I have known\r\nour mates to commit these acts most shamefully, to the disgrace, not\r\nof Christians only, but of men. I have even known them gratify their\r\nbrutal passion with females not ten years old; and these abominations\r\nsome of them practised to such scandalous excess, that one of our\r\ncaptains discharged the mate and others on that account. And yet in\r\nMontserrat I have seen a negro man staked to the ground, and cut most\r\nshockingly, and then his ears cut off bit by bit, because he had been\r\nconnected with a white woman who was a common prostitute: as if it\r\nwere no crime in the whites to rob an innocent African girl of her\r\nvirtue; but most heinous in a black man only to gratify a passion of\r\nnature, where the temptation was offered by one of a different colour,\r\nthough the most abandoned woman of her species. Another negro man was\r\nhalf hanged, and then burnt, for attempting to poison a cruel\r\noverseer. Thus by repeated cruelties are the wretched first urged to\r\ndespair, and then murdered, because they still retain so much of human\r\nnature about them as to wish to put an end to their misery, and\r\nretaliate on their tyrants! These overseers are indeed for the most\r\npart persons of the worst character of any denomination of men in the\r\nWest Indies. Unfortunately, many humane gentlemen, by not residing on\r\ntheir estates, are obliged to leave the management of them in the\r\nhands of these human butchers, who cut and mangle the slaves in a\r\nshocking manner on the most trifling occasions, and altogether treat\r\nthem in every respect like brutes. They pay no regard to the situation\r\nof pregnant women, nor the least attention to the lodging of the\r\nfield negroes. Their huts, which ought to be well covered, and the\r\nplace dry where they take their little repose, are often open sheds,\r\nbuilt in damp places; so that, when the poor creatures return tired\r\nfrom the toils of the field, they contract many disorders, from being\r\nexposed to the damp air in this uncomfortable state, while they are\r\nheated, and their pores are open. This neglect certainly conspires\r\nwith many others to cause a decrease in the births as well as in the\r\nlives of the grown negroes. I can quote many instances of gentlemen\r\nwho reside on their estates in the West Indies, and then the scene is\r\nquite changed; the negroes are treated with lenity and proper care, by\r\nwhich their lives are prolonged, and their masters are profited. To\r\nthe honour of humanity, I knew several gentlemen who managed their\r\nestates in this manner; and they found that benevolence was their true\r\ninterest. And, among many I could mention in several of the islands, I\r\nknew one in Montserrat[R] whose slaves looked remarkably well, and\r\nnever needed any fresh supplies of negroes; and there are many other\r\nestates, especially in Barbadoes, which, from such judicious\r\ntreatment, need no fresh stock of negroes at any time. I have the\r\nhonour of knowing a most worthy and humane gentleman, who is a native\r\nof Barbadoes, and has estates there[S]. This gentleman has written a\r\ntreatise on the usage of his own slaves. He allows them two hours for\r\nrefreshment at mid-day; and many other indulgencies and comforts,\r\nparticularly in their lying; and, besides this, he raises more\r\nprovisions on his estate than they can destroy; so that by these\r\nattentions he saves the lives of his negroes, and keeps them healthy,\r\nand as happy as the condition of slavery can admit. I myself, as shall\r\nappear in the sequel, managed an estate, where, by those attentions,\r\nthe negroes were uncommonly cheerful and healthy, and did more work by\r\nhalf than by the common mode of treatment they usually do. For want,\r\ntherefore, of such care and attention to the poor negroes, and\r\notherwise oppressed as they are, it is no wonder that the decrease\r\nshould require 20,000 new negroes annually to fill up the vacant\r\nplaces of the dead.\r\n\r\nEven in Barbadoes, notwithstanding those humane exceptions which I\r\nhave mentioned, and others I am acquainted with, which justly make it\r\nquoted as a place where slaves meet with the best treatment, and need\r\nfewest recruits of any in the West Indies, yet this island requires\r\n1000 negroes annually to keep up the original stock, which is only\r\n80,000. So that the whole term of a negro\'s life may be said to be\r\nthere but sixteen years![T] And yet the climate here is in every\r\nrespect the same as that from which they are taken, except in being\r\nmore wholesome. Do the British colonies decrease in this manner? And\r\nyet what a prodigious difference is there between an English and West\r\nIndia climate?\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Montserrat I knew a negro man, named Emanuel Sankey,\r\nwho endeavoured to escape from his miserable bondage, by concealing\r\nhimself on board of a London ship: but fate did not favour the poor\r\noppressed man; for, being discovered when the vessel was under sail,\r\nhe was delivered up again to his master. This Christian master\r\nimmediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wrist and\r\nancle, and then took some sticks of sealing wax, and lighted them, and\r\ndroped it all over his back. There was another master who was noted\r\nfor cruelty; and I believe he had not a slave but what had been cut,\r\nand had pieces fairly taken out of the flesh: and, after they had been\r\npunished thus, he used to make them get into a long wooden box or case\r\nhe had for that purpose, in which he shut them up during pleasure. It\r\nwas just about the height and breadth of a man; and the poor wretches\r\nhad no room, when in the case, to move.\r\n\r\nIt was very common in several of the islands, particularly in St.\r\nKitt\'s, for the slaves to be branded with the initial letters of their\r\nmaster\'s name; and a load of heavy iron hooks hung about their necks.\r\nIndeed on the most trifling occasions they were loaded with chains;\r\nand often instruments of torture were added. The iron muzzle,\r\nthumb-screws, &c. are so well known, as not to need a description, and\r\nwere sometimes applied for the slightest faults. I have seen a negro\r\nbeaten till some of his bones were broken, for even letting a pot boil\r\nover. Is it surprising that usage like this should drive the poor\r\ncreatures to despair, and make them seek a refuge in death from those\r\nevils which render their lives intolerable--while,\r\n\r\n    "With shudd\'ring horror pale, and eyes aghast,\r\n    They view their lamentable lot, and find\r\n    No rest!"\r\n\r\nThis they frequently do. A negro-man on board a vessel of my master,\r\nwhile I belonged to her, having been put in irons for some trifling\r\nmisdemeanor, and kept in that state for some days, being weary of\r\nlife, took an opportunity of jumping overboard into the sea; however,\r\nhe was picked up without being drowned. Another, whose life was also a\r\nburden to him, resolved to starve himself to death, and refused to eat\r\nany victuals; this procured him a severe flogging: and he also, on the\r\nfirst occasion which offered, jumped overboard at Charles Town, but\r\nwas saved.\r\n\r\nNor is there any greater regard shewn to the little property than\r\nthere is to the persons and lives of the negroes. I have already\r\nrelated an instance or two of particular oppression out of many which\r\nI have witnessed; but the following is frequent in all the islands.\r\nThe wretched field-slaves, after toiling all the day for an unfeeling\r\nowner, who gives them but little victuals, steal sometimes a few\r\nmoments from rest or refreshment to gather some small portion of\r\ngrass, according as their time will admit. This they commonly tie up\r\nin a parcel; (either a bit, worth six pence; or half a bit\'s-worth)\r\nand bring it to town, or to the market, to sell. Nothing is more\r\ncommon than for the white people on this occasion to take the grass\r\nfrom them without paying for it; and not only so, but too often also,\r\nto my knowledge, our clerks, and many others, at the same time have\r\ncommitted acts of violence on the poor, wretched, and helpless\r\nfemales; whom I have seen for hours stand crying to no purpose, and\r\nget no redress or pay of any kind. Is not this one common and crying\r\nsin enough to bring down God\'s judgment on the islands? He tells us\r\nthe oppressor and the oppressed are both in his hands; and if these\r\nare not the poor, the broken-hearted, the blind, the captive, the\r\nbruised, which our Saviour speaks of, who are they? One of these\r\ndepredators once, in St. Eustatia, came on board of our vessel, and\r\nbought some fowls and pigs of me; and a whole day after his departure\r\nwith the things he returned again and wanted his money back: I refused\r\nto give it; and, not seeing my captain on board, he began the common\r\npranks with me; and swore he would even break open my chest and take\r\nmy money. I therefore expected, as my captain was absent, that he\r\nwould be as good as his word: and he was just proceeding to strike me,\r\nwhen fortunately a British seaman on board, whose heart had not been\r\ndebauched by a West India climate, interposed and prevented him. But\r\nhad the cruel man struck me I certainly should have defended myself at\r\nthe hazard of my life; for what is life to a man thus oppressed? He\r\nwent away, however, swearing; and threatened that whenever he caught\r\nme on shore he would shoot me, and pay for me afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe small account in which the life of a negro is held in the West\r\nIndies is so universally known, that it might seem impertinent to\r\nquote the following extract, if some people had not been hardy enough\r\nof late to assert that negroes are on the same footing in that respect\r\nas Europeans. By the 329th Act, page 125, of the Assembly of\r\nBarbadoes, it is enacted \'That if any negro, or other slave, under\r\npunishment by his master, or his order, for running away, or any other\r\ncrime or misdemeanor towards his said master, unfortunately shall\r\nsuffer in life or member, no person whatsoever shall be liable to a\r\nfine; but if any man shall out of _wantonness, or only of\r\nbloody-mindedness, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a negro, or other\r\nslave, of his own, he shall pay into the public treasury fifteen\r\npounds sterling_.\' And it is the same in most, if not all, of the West\r\nIndia islands. Is not this one of the many acts of the islands which\r\ncall loudly for redress? And do not the assembly which enacted it\r\ndeserve the appellation of savages and brutes rather than of\r\nChristians and men? It is an act at once unmerciful, unjust, and\r\nunwise; which for cruelty would disgrace an assembly of those who are\r\ncalled barbarians; and for its injustice and _insanity_ would shock\r\nthe morality and common sense of a Samaide or a Hottentot.\r\n\r\nShocking as this and many more acts of the bloody West India code at\r\nfirst view appear, how is the iniquity of it heightened when we\r\nconsider to whom it may be extended! Mr. James Tobin, a zealous\r\nlabourer in the vineyard of slavery, gives an account of a French\r\nplanter of his acquaintance, in the island of Martinico, who shewed\r\nhim many mulattoes working in the fields like beasts of burden; and he\r\ntold Mr. Tobin these were all the produce of his own loins! And I\r\nmyself have known similar instances. Pray, reader, are these sons and\r\ndaughters of the French planter less his children by being begotten on\r\na black woman? And what must be the virtue of those legislators, and\r\nthe feelings of those fathers, who estimate the lives of their sons,\r\nhowever begotten, at no more than fifteen pounds; though they should\r\nbe murdered, as the act says, _out of wantonness and bloody-mindedness_!\r\nBut is not the slave trade entirely a war with the heart of man? And\r\nsurely that which is begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue\r\ninvolves in its continuance destruction to every principle, and buries\r\nall sentiments in ruin!\r\n\r\nI have often seen slaves, particularly those who were meagre, in\r\ndifferent islands, put into scales and weighed; and then sold from\r\nthree pence to six pence or nine pence a pound. My master, however,\r\nwhose humanity was shocked at this mode, used to sell such by the\r\nlump. And at or after a sale it was not uncommon to see negroes taken\r\nfrom their wives, wives taken from their husbands, and children from\r\ntheir parents, and sent off to other islands, and wherever else their\r\nmerciless lords chose; and probably never more during life to see each\r\nother! Oftentimes my heart has bled at these partings; when the\r\nfriends of the departed have been at the water side, and, with sighs\r\nand tears, have kept their eyes fixed on the vessel till it went out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nA poor Creole negro I knew well, who, after having been often thus\r\ntransported from island to island, at last resided in Montserrat. This\r\nman used to tell me many melancholy tales of himself. Generally, after\r\nhe had done working for his master, he used to employ his few leisure\r\nmoments to go a fishing. When he had caught any fish, his master would\r\nfrequently take them from him without paying him; and at other times\r\nsome other white people would serve him in the same manner. One day he\r\nsaid to me, very movingly, \'Sometimes when a white man take away my\r\nfish I go to my maser, and he get me my right; and when my maser by\r\nstrength take away my fishes, what me must do? I can\'t go to any body\r\nto be righted; then\' said the poor man, looking up above \'I must look\r\nup to God Mighty in the top for right.\' This artless tale moved me\r\nmuch, and I could not help feeling the just cause Moses had in\r\nredressing his brother against the Egyptian. I exhorted the man to\r\nlook up still to the God on the top, since there was no redress below.\r\nThough I little thought then that I myself should more than once\r\nexperience such imposition, and read the same exhortation hereafter,\r\nin my own transactions in the islands; and that even this poor man and\r\nI should some time after suffer together in the same manner, as shall\r\nbe related hereafter.\r\n\r\nNor was such usage as this confined to particular places or\r\nindividuals; for, in all the different islands in which I have been\r\n(and I have visited no less than fifteen) the treatment of the slaves\r\nwas nearly the same; so nearly indeed, that the history of an island,\r\nor even a plantation, with a few such exceptions as I have mentioned,\r\nmight serve for a history of the whole. Such a tendency has the\r\nslave-trade to debauch men\'s minds, and harden them to every feeling\r\nof humanity! For I will not suppose that the dealers in slaves are\r\nborn worse than other men--No; it is the fatality of this mistaken\r\navarice, that it corrupts the milk of human kindness and turns it into\r\ngall. And, had the pursuits of those men been different, they might\r\nhave been as generous, as tender-hearted and just, as they are\r\nunfeeling, rapacious and cruel. Surely this traffic cannot be good,\r\nwhich spreads like a pestilence, and taints what it touches! which\r\nviolates that first natural right of mankind, equality and\r\nindependency, and gives one man a dominion over his fellows which God\r\ncould never intend! For it raises the owner to a state as far above\r\nman as it depresses the slave below it; and, with all the presumption\r\nof human pride, sets a distinction between them, immeasurable in\r\nextent, and endless in duration! Yet how mistaken is the avarice even\r\nof the planters? Are slaves more useful by being thus humbled to the\r\ncondition of brutes, than they would be if suffered to enjoy the\r\nprivileges of men? The freedom which diffuses health and prosperity\r\nthroughout Britain answers you--No. When you make men slaves you\r\ndeprive them of half their virtue, you set them in your own conduct an\r\nexample of fraud, rapine, and cruelty, and compel them to live with\r\nyou in a state of war; and yet you complain that they are not honest\r\nor faithful! You stupify them with stripes, and think it necessary to\r\nkeep them in a state of ignorance; and yet you assert that they are\r\nincapable of learning; that their minds are such a barren soil or\r\nmoor, that culture would be lost on them; and that they come from a\r\nclimate, where nature, though prodigal of her bounties in a degree\r\nunknown to yourselves, has left man alone scant and unfinished, and\r\nincapable of enjoying the treasures she has poured out for him!--An\r\nassertion at once impious and absurd. Why do you use those instruments\r\nof torture? Are they fit to be applied by one rational being to\r\nanother? And are ye not struck with shame and mortification, to see\r\nthe partakers of your nature reduced so low? But, above all, are there\r\nno dangers attending this mode of treatment? Are you not hourly in\r\ndread of an insurrection? Nor would it be surprising: for when\r\n\r\n    "--No peace is given\r\n    To us enslav\'d, but custody severe;\r\n    And stripes and arbitrary punishment\r\n    Inflicted--What peace can we return?\r\n    But to our power, hostility and hate;\r\n    Untam\'d reluctance, and revenge, though slow,\r\n    Yet ever plotting how the conqueror least\r\n    May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice\r\n    In doing what we most in suffering feel."\r\n\r\nBut by changing your conduct, and treating your slaves as men, every\r\ncause of fear would be banished. They would be faithful, honest,\r\nintelligent and vigorous; and peace, prosperity, and happiness, would\r\nattend you.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: Thus was I sacrificed to the envy and resentment of this\r\nwoman for knowing that the lady whom she had succeeded in my master\'s\r\ngood graces designed to take me into her service; which, had I once\r\ngot on shore, she would not have been able to prevent. She felt her\r\npride alarmed at the superiority of her rival in being attended by a\r\nblack servant: it was not less to prevent this than to be revenged on\r\nme, that she caused the captain to treat me thus cruelly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: "The Dying Negro," a poem originally published in 1773.\r\nPerhaps it may not be deemed impertinent here to add, that this\r\nelegant and pathetic little poem was occasioned, as appears by the\r\nadvertisement prefixed to it, by the following incident.

The punishments of\r\nthe slaves on every trifling occasion are so frequent, and so well\r\nknown, together with the different instruments with which they are\r\ntortured, that it cannot any longer afford novelty to recite them; and\r\nthey are too shocking to yield delight either to the writer or the\r\nreader. I shall therefore hereafter only mention such as incidentally\r\nbefel myself in the course of my adventures.\r\n\r\nIn the variety of departments in which I was employed by my master, I\r\nhad an opportunity of seeing many curious scenes in different islands;\r\nbut, above all, I was struck with a celebrated curiosity called\r\nBrimstone-Hill, which is a high and steep mountain, some few miles\r\nfrom the town of Plymouth in Montserrat. I had often heard of some\r\nwonders that were to be seen on this hill, and I went once with some\r\nwhite and black people to visit it. When we arrived at the top, I saw\r\nunder different cliffs great flakes of brimstone, occasioned by the\r\nsteams of various little ponds, which were then boiling naturally in\r\nthe earth. Some of these ponds were as white as milk, some quite blue,\r\nand many others of different colours. I had taken some potatoes with\r\nme, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they\r\nwere well boiled. I tasted some of them, but they were very\r\nsulphurous; and the silver shoe buckles, and all the other things of\r\nthat metal we had among us, were, in a little time, turned as black\r\nas lead.\r\n\r\nSome time in the year 1763 kind Providence seemed to appear rather\r\nmore favourable to me. One of my master\'s vessels, a Bermudas sloop,\r\nabout sixty tons, was commanded by one Captain Thomas Farmer, an\r\nEnglishman, a very alert and active man, who gained my master a great\r\ndeal of money by his good management in carrying passengers from one\r\nisland to another; but very often his sailors used to get drunk and\r\nrun away from the vessel, which hindered him in his business very\r\nmuch. This man had taken a liking to me; and many different times\r\nbegged of my master to let me go a trip with him as a sailor; but he\r\nwould tell him he could not spare me, though the vessel sometimes\r\ncould not go for want of hands, for sailors were generally very scarce\r\nin the island. However, at last, from necessity or force, my master\r\nwas prevailed on, though very reluctantly, to let me go with this\r\ncaptain; but he gave great charge to him to take care that I did not\r\nrun away, for if I did he would make him pay for me. This being the\r\ncase, the captain had for some time a sharp eye upon me whenever the\r\nvessel anchored; and as soon as she returned I was sent for on shore\r\nagain. Thus was I slaving as it were for life, sometimes at one thing,\r\nand sometimes at another; so that the captain and I were nearly the\r\nmost useful men in my master\'s employment. I also became so useful to\r\nthe captain on shipboard, that many times, when he used to ask for me\r\nto go with him, though it should be but for twenty-four hours, to some\r\nof the islands near us, my master would answer he could not spare me,\r\nat which the captain would swear, and would not go the trip; and tell\r\nmy master I was better to him on board than any three white men he\r\nhad; for they used to behave ill in many respects, particularly in\r\ngetting drunk; and then they frequently got the boat stove, so as to\r\nhinder the vessel from coming back as soon as she might have done.\r\nThis my master knew very well; and at last, by the captain\'s constant\r\nentreaties, after I had been several times with him, one day, to my\r\ngreat joy, my master told me the captain would not let him rest, and\r\nasked me whether I would go aboard as a sailor, or stay on shore and\r\nmind the stores, for he could not bear any longer to be plagued in\r\nthis manner. I was very happy at this proposal, for I immediately\r\nthought I might in time stand some chance by being on board to get a\r\nlittle money, or possibly make my escape if I should be used ill: I\r\nalso expected to get better food, and in greater abundance; for I had\r\nfelt much hunger oftentimes, though my master treated his slaves, as I\r\nhave observed, uncommonly well. I therefore, without hesitation,\r\nanswered him, that I would go and be a sailor if he pleased.\r\nAccordingly I was ordered on board directly. Nevertheless, between the\r\nvessel and the shore, when she was in port, I had little or no rest,\r\nas my master always wished to have me along with him. Indeed he was a\r\nvery pleasant gentleman, and but for my expectations on shipboard I\r\nshould not have thought of leaving him. But the captain liked me also\r\nvery much, and I was entirely his right-hand man. I did all I could to\r\ndeserve his favour, and in return I received better treatment from him\r\nthan any other I believe ever met with in the West Indies in my\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been sailing for some time with this captain, at length I\r\nendeavoured to try my luck and commence merchant. I had but a very\r\nsmall capital to begin with; for one single half bit, which is equal\r\nto three pence in England, made up my whole stock. However I trusted\r\nto the Lord to be with me; and at one of our trips to St. Eustatia, a\r\nDutch island, I bought a glass tumbler with my half bit, and when I\r\ncame to Montserrat I sold it for a bit, or sixpence. Luckily we made\r\nseveral successive trips to St. Eustatia (which was a general mart for\r\nthe West Indies, about twenty leagues from Montserrat); and in our\r\nnext, finding my tumbler so profitable, with this one bit I bought two\r\ntumblers more; and when I came back I sold them for two bits, equal to\r\na shilling sterling. When we went again I bought with these two bits\r\nfour more of these glasses, which I sold for four bits on our return\r\nto Montserrat; and in our next voyage to St. Eustatia I bought two\r\nglasses with one bit, and with the other three I bought a jug of\r\nGeneva, nearly about three pints in measure. When we came to\r\nMontserrat I sold the gin for eight bits, and the tumblers for two, so\r\nthat my capital now amounted in all to a dollar, well husbanded and\r\nacquired in the space of a month or six weeks, when I blessed the Lord\r\nthat I was so rich. As we sailed to different islands, I laid this\r\nmoney out in various things occasionally, and it used to turn out to\r\nvery good account, especially when we went to Guadaloupe, Grenada, and\r\nthe rest of the French islands. Thus was I going all about the islands\r\nupwards of four years, and ever trading as I went, during which I\r\nexperienced many instances of ill usage, and have seen many injuries\r\ndone to other negroes in our dealings with Europeans: and, amidst our\r\nrecreations, when we have been dancing and merry-making, they, without\r\ncause, have molested and insulted us. Indeed I was more than once\r\nobliged to look up to God on high, as I had advised the poor fisherman\r\nsome time before. And I had not been long trading for myself in the\r\nmanner I have related above, when I experienced the like trial in\r\ncompany with him as follows: This man being used to the water, was\r\nupon an emergency put on board of us by his master to work as another\r\nhand, on a voyage to Santa Cruz; and at our sailing he had brought his\r\nlittle all for a venture, which consisted of six bits\' worth of limes\r\nand oranges in a bag; I had also my whole stock, which was about\r\ntwelve bits\' worth of the same kind of goods, separate in two bags;\r\nfor we had heard these fruits sold well in that island. When we came\r\nthere, in some little convenient time he and I went ashore with our\r\nfruits to sell them; but we had scarcely landed when we were met by\r\ntwo white men, who presently took our three bags from us. We could not\r\nat first guess what they meant to do; and for some time we thought\r\nthey were jesting with us; but they too soon let us know otherwise,\r\nfor they took our ventures immediately to a house hard by, and\r\nadjoining the fort, while we followed all the way begging of them to\r\ngive us our fruits, but in vain. They not only refused to return them,\r\nbut swore at us, and threatened if we did not immediately depart they\r\nwould flog us well. We told them these three bags were all we were\r\nworth in the world, and that we brought them with us to sell when we\r\ncame from Montserrat, and shewed them the vessel. But this was rather\r\nagainst us, as they now saw we were strangers as well as slaves. They\r\nstill therefore swore, and desired us to be gone, and even took sticks\r\nto beat us; while we, seeing they meant what they said, went off in\r\nthe greatest confusion and despair. Thus, in the very minute of\r\ngaining more by three times than I ever did by any venture in my life\r\nbefore, was I deprived of every farthing I was worth. An\r\ninsupportable misfortune! but how to help ourselves we knew not. In\r\nour consternation we went to the commanding officer of the fort and\r\ntold him how we had been served by some of his people; but we obtained\r\nnot the least redress: he answered our complaints only by a volley of\r\nimprecations against us, and immediately took a horse-whip, in order\r\nto chastise us, so that we were obliged to turn out much faster than\r\nwe came in. I now, in the agony of distress and indignation, wished\r\nthat the ire of God in his forked lightning might transfix these cruel\r\noppressors among the dead. Still however we persevered; went back\r\nagain to the house, and begged and besought them again and again for\r\nour fruits, till at last some other people that were in the house\r\nasked if we would be contented if they kept one bag and gave us the\r\nother two. We, seeing no remedy whatever, consented to this; and they,\r\nobserving one bag to have both kinds of fruit in it, which belonged to\r\nmy companion, kept that; and the other two, which were mine, they gave\r\nus back. As soon as I got them, I ran as fast as I could, and got the\r\nfirst negro man I could to help me off; my companion, however, stayed\r\na little longer to plead; he told them the bag they had was his, and\r\nlikewise all that he was worth in the world; but this was of no avail,\r\nand he was obliged to return without it. The poor old man, wringing\r\nhis hands, cried bitterly for his loss; and, indeed, he then did look\r\nup to God on high, which so moved me with pity for him, that I gave\r\nhim nearly one third of my fruits. We then proceeded to the markets to\r\nsell them; and Providence was more favourable to us than we could have\r\nexpected, for we sold our fruits uncommonly well; I got for mine about\r\nthirty-seven bits. Such a surprising reverse of fortune in so short a\r\nspace of time seemed like a dream to me, and proved no small\r\nencouragement for me to trust the Lord in any situation. My captain\r\nafterwards frequently used to take my part, and get me my right, when\r\nI have been plundered or used ill by these tender Christian\r\ndepredators; among whom I have shuddered to observe the unceasing\r\nblasphemous execrations which are wantonly thrown out by persons of\r\nall ages and conditions, not only without occasion, but even as if\r\nthey were indulgences and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt one of our trips to St. Kitt\'s I had eleven bits of my own; and my\r\nfriendly captain lent me five bits more, with which I bought a Bible.\r\nI was very glad to get this book, which I scarcely could meet with any\r\nwhere. I think there was none sold in Montserrat; and, much to my\r\ngrief, from being forced out of the \xc3\x86tna in the manner I have related,\r\nmy Bible, and the Guide to the Indians, the two books I loved above\r\nall others, were left behind.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in this place, St. Kitt\'s, a very curious imposition on\r\nhuman nature took place:--A white man wanted to marry in the church a\r\nfree black woman that had land and slaves in Montserrat: but the\r\nclergyman told him it was against the law of the place to marry a\r\nwhite and a black in the church. The man then asked to be married on\r\nthe water, to which the parson consented, and the two lovers went in\r\none boat, and the parson and clerk in another, and thus the ceremony\r\nwas performed. After this the loving pair came on board our vessel,\r\nand my captain treated them extremely well, and brought them safe to\r\nMontserrat.\r\n\r\nThe reader cannot but judge of the irksomeness of this situation to a\r\nmind like mine, in being daily exposed to new hardships and\r\nimpositions, after having seen many better days, and having been as it\r\nwere in a state of freedom and plenty; added to which, every part of\r\nthe world I had hitherto been in seemed to me a paradise in comparison\r\nof the West Indies. My mind was therefore hourly replete with\r\ninventions and thoughts of being freed, and, if possible, by honest\r\nand honourable means; for I always remembered the old adage; and I\r\ntrust it has ever been my ruling principle, that honesty is the best\r\npolicy; and likewise that other golden precept--to do unto all men as\r\nI would they should do unto me. However, as I was from early years a\r\npredestinarian, I thought whatever fate had determined must ever come\r\nto pass; and therefore, if ever it were my lot to be freed nothing\r\ncould prevent me, although I should at present see no means or hope to\r\nobtain my freedom; on the other hand, if it were my fate not to be\r\nfreed I never should be so, and all my endeavours for that purpose\r\nwould be fruitless. In the midst of these thoughts I therefore looked\r\nup with prayers anxiously to God for my liberty; and at the same time\r\nI used every honest means, and endeavoured all that was possible on\r\nmy part to obtain it. In process of time I became master of a few\r\npounds, and in a fair way of making more, which my friendly captain\r\nknew very well; this occasioned him sometimes to take liberties with\r\nme: but whenever he treated me waspishly I used plainly to tell him my\r\nmind, and that I would die before I would be imposed on as other\r\nnegroes were, and that to me life had lost its relish when liberty was\r\ngone. This I said although I foresaw my then well-being or future\r\nhopes of freedom (humanly speaking) depended on this man. However, as\r\nhe could not bear the thoughts of my not sailing with him, he always\r\nbecame mild on my threats. I therefore continued with him; and, from\r\nmy great attention to his orders and his business, I gained him\r\ncredit, and through his kindness to me I at last procured my liberty.\r\nWhile I thus went on, filled with the thoughts of freedom, and\r\nresisting oppression as well as I was able, my life hung daily in\r\nsuspense, particularly in the surfs I have formerly mentioned, as I\r\ncould not swim. These are extremely violent throughout the West\r\nIndies, and I was ever exposed to their howling rage and devouring\r\nfury in all the islands. I have seen them strike and toss a boat right\r\nup an end, and maim several on board. Once in the Grenada islands,\r\nwhen I and about eight others were pulling a large boat with two\r\npuncheons of water in it, a surf struck us, and drove the boat and all\r\nin it about half a stone\'s throw, among some trees, and above the high\r\nwater mark. We were obliged to get all the assistance we could from\r\nthe nearest estate to mend the boat, and launch it into the water\r\nagain. At Montserrat one night, in pressing hard to get off the shore\r\non board, the punt was overset with us four times; the first time I\r\nwas very near being drowned; however the jacket I had on kept me up\r\nabove water a little space of time, while I called on a man near me\r\nwho was a good swimmer, and told him I could not swim; he then made\r\nhaste to me, and, just as I was sinking, he caught hold of me, and\r\nbrought me to sounding, and then he went and brought the punt also. As\r\nsoon as we had turned the water out of her, lest we should be used ill\r\nfor being absent, we attempted again three times more, and as often\r\nthe horrid surfs served us as at first; but at last, the fifth time we\r\nattempted, we gained our point, at the imminent hazard of our lives.\r\nOne day also, at Old Road in Montserrat, our captain, and three men\r\nbesides myself, were going in a large canoe in quest of rum and sugar,\r\nwhen a single surf tossed the canoe an amazing distance from the\r\nwater, and some of us even a stone\'s throw from each other: most of us\r\nwere very much bruised; so that I and many more often said, and really\r\nthought, that there was not such another place under the heavens as\r\nthis. I longed therefore much to leave it, and daily wished to see my\r\nmaster\'s promise performed of going to Philadelphia. While we lay in\r\nthis place a very cruel thing happened on board of our sloop which\r\nfilled me with horror; though I found afterwards such practices were\r\nfrequent. There was a very clever and decent free young mulatto-man\r\nwho sailed a long time with us: he had a free woman for his wife, by\r\nwhom he had a child; and she was then living on shore, and all very\r\nhappy. Our captain and mate, and other people on board, and several\r\nelsewhere, even the natives of Bermudas, all knew this young man from\r\na child that he was always free, and no one had ever claimed him as\r\ntheir property: however, as might too often overcomes right in these\r\nparts, it happened that a Bermudas captain, whose vessel lay there for\r\na few days in the road, came on board of us, and seeing the\r\nmulatto-man, whose name was Joseph Clipson, he told him he was not\r\nfree, and that he had orders from his master to bring him to Bermudas.\r\nThe poor man could not believe the captain to be in earnest; but he\r\nwas very soon undeceived, his men laying violent hands on him: and\r\nalthough he shewed a certificate of his being born free in St. Kitt\'s,\r\nand most people on board knew that he served his time to boat\r\nbuilding, and always passed for a free man, yet he was taken forcibly\r\nout of our vessel. He then asked to be carried ashore before the\r\nsecretary or magistrates, and these infernal invaders of human rights\r\npromised him he should; but, instead of that, they carried him on\r\nboard of the other vessel: and the next day, without giving the poor\r\nman any hearing on shore, or suffering him even to see his wife or\r\nchild, he was carried away, and probably doomed never more in this\r\nworld to see them again. Nor was this the only instance of this kind\r\nof barbarity I was a witness to. I have since often seen in Jamaica\r\nand other islands free men, whom I have known in America, thus\r\nvillainously trepanned and held in bondage. I have heard of two\r\nsimilar practices even in Philadelphia: and were it not for the\r\nbenevolence of the quakers in that city many of the sable race, who\r\nnow breathe the air of liberty, would, I believe, be groaning indeed\r\nunder some planter\'s chains. These things opened my mind to a new\r\nscene of horror to which I had been before a stranger. Hitherto I had\r\nthought only slavery dreadful; but the state of a free negro appeared\r\nto me now equally so at least, and in some respects even worse, for\r\nthey live in constant alarm for their liberty; and even this is but\r\nnominal, for they are universally insulted and plundered without the\r\npossibility of redress; for such is the equity of the West Indian\r\nlaws, that no free negro\'s evidence will be admitted in their courts\r\nof justice. In this situation is it surprising that slaves, when\r\nmildly treated, should prefer even the misery of slavery to such a\r\nmockery of freedom? I was now completely disgusted with the West\r\nIndies, and thought I never should be entirely free until I had left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n    "With thoughts like these my anxious boding mind\r\n    Recall\'d those pleasing scenes I left behind;\r\n    Scenes where fair Liberty in bright array\r\n    Makes darkness bright, and e\'en illumines day;\r\n    Where nor complexion, wealth, or station, can\r\n    Protect the wretch who makes a slave of man."\r\n\r\nI determined to make every exertion to obtain my freedom, and to\r\nreturn to Old England. For this purpose I thought a knowledge of\r\nnavigation might be of use to me; for, though I did not intend to run\r\naway unless I should be ill used, yet, in such a case, if I understood\r\nnavigation, I might attempt my escape in our sloop, which was one of\r\nthe swiftest sailing vessels in the West Indies, and I could be at no\r\nloss for hands to join me: and if I should make this attempt, I had\r\nintended to have gone for England; but this, as I said, was only to be\r\nin the event of my meeting with any ill usage. I therefore employed\r\nthe mate of our vessel to teach me navigation, for which I agreed to\r\ngive him twenty-four dollars, and actually paid him part of the money\r\ndown; though when the captain, some time after, came to know that the\r\nmate was to have such a sum for teaching me, he rebuked him, and said\r\nit was a shame for him to take any money from me. However, my\r\nprogress in this useful art was much retarded by the constancy of our\r\nwork. Had I wished to run away I did not want opportunities, which\r\nfrequently presented themselves; and particularly at one time, soon\r\nafter this. When we were at the island of Gaurdeloupe there was a\r\nlarge fleet of merchantmen bound for Old France; and, seamen then\r\nbeing very scarce, they gave from fifteen to twenty pounds a man for\r\nthe run. Our mate, and all the white sailors, left our vessel on this\r\naccount, and went on board of the French ships. They would have had me\r\nalso to go with them, for they regarded me; and they swore to protect\r\nme, if I would go: and, as the fleet was to sail the next day, I\r\nreally believe I could have got safe to Europe at that time. However,\r\nas my master was kind, I would not attempt to leave him; and,\r\nremembering the old maxim, that \'honesty is the best policy,\' I\r\nsuffered them to go without me. Indeed my captain was much afraid of\r\nmy leaving him and the vessel at that time, as I had so fair an\r\nopportunity: but, I thank God, this fidelity of mine turned out much\r\nto my advantage hereafter, when I did not in the least think of it;\r\nand made me so much in favour with the captain, that he used now and\r\nthen to teach me some parts of navigation himself: but some of our\r\npassengers, and others, seeing this, found much fault with him for it,\r\nsaying it was a very dangerous thing to let a negro know navigation;\r\nthus I was hindered again in my pursuits. About the latter end of the\r\nyear 1764 my master bought a larger sloop, called the Providence,\r\nabout seventy or eighty tons, of which my captain had the command. I\r\nwent with him into this vessel, and we took a load of new slaves for\r\nGeorgia and Charles Town. My master now left me entirely to the\r\ncaptain, though he still wished for me to be with him; but I, who\r\nalways much wished to lose sight of the West Indies, was not a little\r\nrejoiced at the thoughts of seeing any other country. Therefore,\r\nrelying on the goodness of my captain, I got ready all the little\r\nventure I could; and, when the vessel was ready, we sailed, to my\r\ngreat joy. When we got to our destined places, Georgia and Charles\r\nTown, I expected I should have an opportunity of selling my little\r\nproperty to advantage: but here, particularly in Charles Town, I met\r\nwith buyers, white men, who imposed on me as in other places.\r\nNotwithstanding, I was resolved to have fortitude; thinking no lot or\r\ntrial is too hard when kind Heaven is the rewarder. We soon got loaded\r\nagain, and returned to Montserrat; and there, amongst the rest of the\r\nislands, I sold my goods well; and in this manner I continued trading\r\nduring the year 1764; meeting with various scenes of imposition, as\r\nusual. After this, my master fitted out his vessel for Philadelphia,\r\nin the year 1765; and during the time we were loading her, and getting\r\nready for the voyage, I worked with redoubled alacrity, from the hope\r\nof getting money enough by these voyages to buy my freedom in time, if\r\nit should please God; and also to see the town of Philadelphia, which\r\nI had heard a great deal about for some years past; besides which, I\r\nhad always longed to prove my master\'s promise the first day I came to\r\nhim. In the midst of these elevated ideas, and while I was about\r\ngetting my little merchandize in readiness, one Sunday my master sent\r\nfor me to his house. When I came there I found him and the captain\r\ntogether; and, on my going in, I was struck with astonishment at his\r\ntelling me he heard that I meant to run away from him when I got to\r\nPhiladelphia: \'And therefore,\' said he, \'I must sell you again: you\r\ncost me a great deal of money, no less than forty pounds sterling; and\r\nit will not do to lose so much. You are a valuable fellow,\' continued\r\nhe; \'and I can get any day for you one hundred guineas, from many\r\ngentlemen in this island.\' And then he told me of Captain Doran\'s\r\nbrother-in-law, a severe master, who ever wanted to buy me to make me\r\nhis overseer. My captain also said he could get much more than a\r\nhundred guineas for me in Carolina. This I knew to be a fact; for the\r\ngentleman that wanted to buy me came off several times on board of us,\r\nand spoke to me to live with him, and said he would use me well. When\r\nI asked what work he would put me to he said, as I was a sailor, he\r\nwould make me a captain of one of his rice vessels. But I refused: and\r\nfearing, at the same time, by a sudden turn I saw in the captain\'s\r\ntemper, he might mean to sell me, I told the gentleman I would not\r\nlive with him on any condition, and that I certainly would run away\r\nwith his vessel: but he said he did not fear that, as he would catch\r\nme again; and then he told me how cruelly he would serve me if I\r\nshould do so. My captain, however, gave him to understand that I knew\r\nsomething of navigation: so he thought better of it; and, to my great\r\njoy, he went away. I now told my master I did not say I would run away\r\nin Philadelphia; neither did I mean it, as he did not use me ill, nor\r\nyet the captain: for if they did I certainly would have made some\r\nattempts before now; but as I thought that if it were God\'s will I\r\never should be freed it would be so, and, on the contrary, if it was\r\nnot his will it would not happen; so I hoped, if ever I were freed,\r\nwhilst I was used well, it should be by honest means; but, as I could\r\nnot help myself, he must do as he pleased; I could only hope and trust\r\nto the God of Heaven; and at that instant my mind was big with\r\ninventions and full of schemes to escape. I then appealed to the\r\ncaptain whether he ever saw any sign of my making the least attempt to\r\nrun away; and asked him if I did not always come on board according to\r\nthe time for which he gave me liberty; and, more particularly, when\r\nall our men left us at Gaurdeloupe and went on board of the French\r\nfleet, and advised me to go with them, whether I might not, and that\r\nhe could not have got me again. To my no small surprise, and very\r\ngreat joy, the captain confirmed every syllable that I had said: and\r\neven more; for he said he had tried different times to see if I would\r\nmake any attempt of this kind, both at St. Eustatia and in America,\r\nand he never found that I made the smallest; but, on the contrary, I\r\nalways came on board according to his orders; and he did really\r\nbelieve, if I ever meant to run away, that, as I could never have had\r\na better opportunity, I would have done it the night the mate and all\r\nthe people left our vessel at Gaurdeloupe. The captain then informed\r\nmy master, who had been thus imposed on by our mate, though I did not\r\nknow who was my enemy, the reason the mate had for imposing this lie\r\nupon him; which was, because I had acquainted the captain of the\r\nprovisions the mate had given away or taken out of the vessel. This\r\nspeech of the captain was like life to the dead to me, and instantly\r\nmy soul glorified God; and still more so on hearing my master\r\nimmediately say that I was a sensible fellow, and he never did intend\r\nto use me as a common slave; and that but for the entreaties of the\r\ncaptain, and his character of me, he would not have let me go from the\r\nstores about as I had done; that also, in so doing, he thought by\r\ncarrying one little thing or other to different places to sell I might\r\nmake money. That he also intended to encourage me in this by crediting\r\nme with half a puncheon of rum and half a hogshead of sugar at a time;\r\nso that, from being careful, I might have money enough, in some time,\r\nto purchase my freedom; and, when that was the case, I might depend\r\nupon it he would let me have it for forty pounds sterling money, which\r\nwas only the same price he gave for me. This sound gladdened my poor\r\nheart beyond measure; though indeed it was no more than the very idea\r\nI had formed in my mind of my master long before, and I immediately\r\nmade him this reply: \'Sir, I always had that very thought of you,\r\nindeed I had, and that made me so diligent in serving you.\' He then\r\ngave me a large piece of silver coin, such as I never had seen or had\r\nbefore, and told me to get ready for the voyage, and he would credit\r\nme with a tierce of sugar, and another of rum; he also said that he\r\nhad two amiable sisters in Philadelphia, from whom I might get some\r\nnecessary things. Upon this my noble captain desired me to go aboard;\r\nand, knowing the African metal, he charged me not to say any thing of\r\nthis matter to any body; and he promised that the lying mate should\r\nnot go with him any more. This was a change indeed; in the same hour\r\nto feel the most exquisite pain, and in the turn of a moment the\r\nfullest joy. It caused in me such sensations as I was only able to\r\nexpress in my looks; my heart was so overpowered with gratitude that I\r\ncould have kissed both of their feet. When I left the room I\r\nimmediately went, or rather flew, to the vessel, which being loaded,\r\nmy master, as good as his word, trusted me with a tierce of rum, and\r\nanother of sugar, when we sailed, and arrived safe at the elegant town\r\nof Philadelphia. I soon sold my goods here pretty well; and in this\r\ncharming place I found every thing plentiful and cheap.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in this place a very extraordinary occurrence befell me. I\r\nhad been told one evening of a _wise_ woman, a Mrs. Davis, who\r\nrevealed secrets, foretold events, &c. I put little faith in this\r\nstory at first, as I could not conceive that any mortal could foresee\r\nthe future disposals of Providence, nor did I believe in any other\r\nrevelation than that of the Holy Scriptures; however, I was greatly\r\nastonished at seeing this woman in a dream that night, though a\r\nperson I never before beheld in my life; this made such an impression\r\non me, that I could not get the idea the next day out of my mind, and\r\nI then became as anxious to see her as I was before indifferent;\r\naccordingly in the evening, after we left off working, I inquired\r\nwhere she lived, and being directed to her, to my inexpressible\r\nsurprise, beheld the very woman in the very same dress she appeared to\r\nme to wear in the vision. She immediately told me I had dreamed of her\r\nthe preceding night; related to me many things that had happened with\r\na correctness that astonished me; and finally told me I should not be\r\nlong a slave: this was the more agreeable news, as I believed it the\r\nmore readily from her having so faithfully related the past incidents\r\nof my life. She said I should be twice in very great danger of my life\r\nwithin eighteen months, which, if I escaped, I should afterwards go on\r\nwell; so, giving me her blessing, we parted. After staying here some\r\ntime till our vessel was loaded, and I had bought in my little\r\ntraffic, we sailed from this agreeable spot for Montserrat, once more\r\nto encounter the raging surfs.\r\n\r\nWe arrived safe at Montserrat, where we discharged our cargo; and soon\r\nafter that we took slaves on board for St. Eustatia, and from thence\r\nto Georgia. I had always exerted myself and did double work, in order\r\nto make our voyages as short as possible; and from thus over-working\r\nmyself while we were at Georgia I caught a fever and ague. I was very\r\nill for eleven days and near dying; eternity was now exceedingly\r\nimpressed on my mind, and I feared very much that awful event. I\r\nprayed the Lord therefore to spare me; and I made a promise in my mind\r\nto God, that I would be good if ever I should recover. At length, from\r\nhaving an eminent doctor to attend me, I was restored again to health;\r\nand soon after we got the vessel loaded, and set off for Montserrat.\r\nDuring the passage, as I was perfectly restored, and had much business\r\nof the vessel to mind, all my endeavours to keep up my integrity, and\r\nperform my promise to God, began to fail; and, in spite of all I could\r\ndo, as we drew nearer and nearer to the islands, my resolutions more\r\nand more declined, as if the very air of that country or climate\r\nseemed fatal to piety. When we were safe arrived at Montserrat, and I\r\nhad got ashore, I forgot my former resolutions.--Alas! how prone is\r\nthe heart to leave that God it wishes to love! and how strongly do the\r\nthings of this world strike the senses and captivate the soul!--After\r\nour vessel was discharged, we soon got her ready, and took in, as\r\nusual, some of the poor oppressed natives of Africa, and other\r\nnegroes; we then set off again for Georgia and Charlestown. We arrived\r\nat Georgia, and, having landed part of our cargo, proceeded to\r\nCharlestown with the remainder. While we were there I saw the town\r\nilluminated; the guns were fired, and bonfires and other\r\ndemonstrations of joy shewn, on account of the repeal of the stamp\r\nact. Here I disposed of some goods on my own account; the white men\r\nbuying them with smooth promises and fair words, giving me however but\r\nvery indifferent payment. There was one gentleman particularly who\r\nbought a puncheon of rum of me, which gave me a great deal of trouble;\r\nand, although I used the interest of my friendly captain, I could not\r\nobtain any thing for it; for, being a negro man, I could not oblige\r\nhim to pay me. This vexed me much, not knowing how to act; and I lost\r\nsome time in seeking after this Christian; and though, when the\r\nSabbath came (which the negroes usually make their holiday) I was much\r\ninclined to go to public worship, I was obliged to hire some black men\r\nto help to pull a boat across the water to God in quest of this\r\ngentleman. When I found him, after much entreaty, both from myself and\r\nmy worthy captain, he at last paid me in dollars; some of them,\r\nhowever, were copper, and of consequence of no value; but he took\r\nadvantage of my being a negro man, and obliged me to put up with those\r\nor none, although I objected to them. Immediately after, as I was\r\ntrying to pass them in the market, amongst other white men, I was\r\nabused for offering to pass bad coin; and, though I shewed them the\r\nman I got them from, I was within one minute of being tied up and\r\nflogged without either judge or jury; however, by the help of a good\r\npair of heels, I ran off, and so escaped the bastinadoes I should have\r\nreceived. I got on board as fast as I could, but still continued in\r\nfear of them until we sailed, which I thanked God we did not long\r\nafter; and I have never been amongst them since.\r\n\r\nWe soon came to Georgia, where we were to complete our lading; and\r\nhere worse fate than ever attended me: for one Sunday night, as I was\r\nwith some negroes in their master\'s yard in the town of Savannah, it\r\nhappened that their master, one Doctor Perkins, who was a very severe\r\nand cruel man, came in drunk; and, not liking to see any strange\r\nnegroes in his yard, he and a ruffian of a white man he had in his\r\nservice beset me in an instant, and both of them struck me with the\r\nfirst weapons they could get hold of. I cried out as long as I could\r\nfor help and mercy; but, though I gave a good account of myself, and\r\nhe knew my captain, who lodged hard by him, it was to no purpose. They\r\nbeat and mangled me in a shameful manner, leaving me near dead. I lost\r\nso much blood from the wounds I received, that I lay quite motionless,\r\nand was so benumbed that I could not feel any thing for many hours.\r\nEarly in the morning they took me away to the jail. As I did not\r\nreturn to the ship all night, my captain, not knowing where I was, and\r\nbeing uneasy that I did not then make my appearance, he made inquiry\r\nafter me; and, having found where I was, immediately came to me. As\r\nsoon as the good man saw me so cut and mangled, he could not forbear\r\nweeping; he soon got me out of jail to his lodgings, and immediately\r\nsent for the best doctors in the place, who at first declared it as\r\ntheir opinion that I could not recover. My captain on this went to all\r\nthe lawyers in the town for their advice, but they told him they could\r\ndo nothing for me as I was a negro. He then went to Doctor Perkins,\r\nthe hero who had vanquished me, and menaced him, swearing he would be\r\nrevenged of him, and challenged him to fight.--But cowardice is ever\r\nthe companion of cruelty--and the Doctor refused. However, by the\r\nskilfulness of one Doctor Brady of that place, I began at last to\r\namend; but, although I was so sore and bad with the wounds I had all\r\nover me that I could not rest in any posture, yet I was in more pain\r\non account of the captain\'s uneasiness about me than I otherwise\r\nshould have been. The worthy man nursed and watched me all the hours\r\nof the night; and I was, through his attention and that of the doctor,\r\nable to get out of bed in about sixteen or eighteen days. All this\r\ntime I was very much wanted on board, as I used frequently to go up\r\nand down the river for rafts, and other parts of our cargo, and stow\r\nthem when the mate was sick or absent. In about four weeks I was able\r\nto go on duty; and in a fortnight after, having got in all our\r\nlading, our vessel set sail for Montserrat; and in less than three\r\nweeks we arrived there safe towards the end of the year. This ended my\r\nadventures in 1764; for I did not leave Montserrat again till the\r\nbeginning of the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     They ran the ship aground: and the fore part stuck fast, and\r\n     remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with\r\n     the violence of the waves.\r\n                                         Acts xxvii. 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Howbeit, we must be cast upon a certain island;\r\n\r\n     Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it\r\n     shall be even as it was told me.\r\n                                         Acts xxvii. 26, 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received\r\n     a little thereof.\r\n\r\n     In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep\r\n     falleth on men.\r\n                                         Job iv. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Lo, all these _things_ worketh God oftentimes with man,\r\n\r\n     To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with\r\n     the light of the living.\r\n                                         Job xxxiii. 29, 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

I was not long ungratified; for, in\r\nthe beginning of the year 1766, my master bought another sloop, named\r\nthe Nancy, the largest I had ever seen. She was partly laden, and was\r\nto proceed to Philadelphia; our Captain had his choice of three, and I\r\nwas well pleased he chose this, which was the largest; for, from his\r\nhaving a large vessel, I had more room, and could carry a larger\r\nquantity of goods with me. Accordingly, when we had delivered our old\r\nvessel, the Prudence, and completed the lading of the Nancy, having\r\nmade near three hundred per cent, by four barrels of pork I brought\r\nfrom Charlestown, I laid in as large a cargo as I could, trusting to\r\nGod\'s providence to prosper my undertaking. With these views I sailed\r\nfor Philadelphia. On our passage, when we drew near the land, I was\r\nfor the first time surprised at the sight of some whales, having never\r\nseen any such large sea monsters before; and as we sailed by the land\r\none morning I saw a puppy whale close by the vessel; it was about the\r\nlength of a wherry boat, and it followed us all the day till we got\r\nwithin the Capes. We arrived safe and in good time at Philadelphia,\r\nand I sold my goods there chiefly to the quakers. They always appeared\r\nto be a very honest discreet sort of people, and never attempted to\r\nimpose on me; I therefore liked them, and ever after chose to deal\r\nwith them in preference to any others. One Sunday morning while I was\r\nhere, as I was going to church, I chanced to pass a meeting-house. The\r\ndoors being open, and the house full of people, it excited my\r\ncuriosity to go in. When I entered the house, to my great surprise, I\r\nsaw a very tall woman standing in the midst of them, speaking in an\r\naudible voice something which I could not understand. Having never\r\nseen anything of this kind before, I stood and stared about me for\r\nsome time, wondering at this odd scene. As soon as it was over I took\r\nan opportunity to make inquiry about the place and people, when I was\r\ninformed they were called Quakers. I particularly asked what that\r\nwoman I saw in the midst of them had said, but none of them were\r\npleased to satisfy me; so I quitted them, and soon after, as I was\r\nreturning, I came to a church crowded with people; the church-yard was\r\nfull likewise, and a number of people were even mounted on ladders,\r\nlooking in at the windows. I thought this a strange sight, as I had\r\nnever seen churches, either in England or the West Indies, crowded in\r\nthis manner before. I therefore made bold to ask some people the\r\nmeaning of all this, and they told me the Rev. Mr. George Whitfield\r\nwas preaching. I had often heard of this gentleman, and had wished to\r\nsee and hear him; but I had never before had an opportunity. I now\r\ntherefore resolved to gratify myself with the sight, and I pressed in\r\namidst the multitude. When I got into the church I saw this pious man\r\nexhorting the people with the greatest fervour and earnestness, and\r\nsweating as much as I ever did while in slavery on Montserrat beach. I\r\nwas very much struck and impressed with this; I thought it strange I\r\nhad never seen divines exert themselves in this manner before, and I\r\nwas no longer at a loss to account for the thin congregations they\r\npreached to. When we had discharged our cargo here, and were loaded\r\nagain, we left this fruitful land once more, and set sail for\r\nMontserrat. My traffic had hitherto succeeded so well with me, that I\r\nthought, by selling my goods when we arrived at Montserrat, I should\r\nhave enough to purchase my freedom. But, as soon as our vessel arrived\r\nthere, my master came on board, and gave orders for us to go to St.\r\nEustatia, and discharge our cargo there, and from thence proceed for\r\nGeorgia. I was much disappointed at this; but thinking, as usual, it\r\nwas of no use to encounter with the decrees of fate, I submitted\r\nwithout repining, and we went to St. Eustatia. After we had discharged\r\nour cargo there we took in a live cargo, as we call a cargo of slaves.\r\nHere I sold my goods tolerably well; but, not being able to lay out\r\nall my money in this small island to as much advantage as in many\r\nother places, I laid out only part, and the remainder I brought away\r\nwith me neat. We sailed from hence for Georgia, and I was glad when we\r\ngot there, though I had not much reason to like the place from my last\r\nadventure in Savannah; but I longed to get back to Montserrat and\r\nprocure my freedom, which I expected to be able to purchase when I\r\nreturned. As soon as we arrived here I waited on my careful doctor,\r\nMr. Brady, to whom I made the most grateful acknowledgments in my\r\npower for his former kindness and attention during my illness. While\r\nwe were here an odd circumstance happened to the Captain and me, which\r\ndisappointed us both a good deal. A silversmith, whom we had brought\r\nto this place some voyages before, agreed with the Captain to return\r\nwith us to the West Indies, and promised at the same time to give the\r\nCaptain a great deal of money, having pretended to take a liking to\r\nhim, and being, as we thought, very rich. But while we stayed to load\r\nour vessel this man was taken ill in a house where he worked, and in a\r\nweek\'s time became very bad. The worse he grew the more he used to\r\nspeak of giving the Captain what he had promised him, so that he\r\nexpected something considerable from the death of this man, who had no\r\nwife or child, and he attended him day and night. I used also to go\r\nwith the Captain, at his own desire, to attend him; especially when we\r\nsaw there was no appearance of his recovery: and, in order to\r\nrecompense me for my trouble, the Captain promised me ten pounds, when\r\nhe should get the man\'s property. I thought this would be of great\r\nservice to me, although I had nearly money enough to purchase my\r\nfreedom, if I should get safe this voyage to Montserrat. In this\r\nexpectation I laid out above eight pounds of my money for a suit of\r\nsuperfine clothes to dance with at my freedom, which I hoped was then\r\nat hand. We still continued to attend this man, and were with him even\r\non the last day he lived, till very late at night, when we went on\r\nboard. After we were got to bed, about one or two o\'clock in the\r\nmorning, the Captain was sent for, and informed the man was dead. On\r\nthis he came to my bed, and, waking me, informed me of it, and desired\r\nme to get up and procure a light, and immediately go to him. I told\r\nhim I was very sleepy, and wished he would take somebody else with\r\nhim; or else, as the man was dead, and could want no farther\r\nattendance, to let all things remain as they were till the next\r\nmorning. \'No, no,\' said he, \'we will have the money to-night, I cannot\r\nwait till to-morrow; so let us go.\' Accordingly I got up and struck a\r\nlight, and away we both went and saw the man as dead as we could wish.\r\nThe Captain said he would give him a grand burial, in gratitude for\r\nthe promised treasure; and desired that all the things belonging to\r\nthe deceased might be brought forth. Among others, there was a nest of\r\ntrunks of which he had kept the keys whilst the man was ill, and when\r\nthey were produced we opened them with no small eagerness and\r\nexpectation; and as there were a great number within one another, with\r\nmuch impatience we took them one out of the other. At last, when we\r\ncame to the smallest, and had opened it, we saw it was full of papers,\r\nwhich we supposed to be notes; at the sight of which our hearts leapt\r\nfor joy; and that instant the Captain, clapping his hands, cried out,\r\n\'Thank God, here it is.\' But when we took up the trunk, and began to\r\nexamine the supposed treasure and long-looked-for bounty, (alas! alas!\r\nhow uncertain and deceitful are all human affairs!) what had we found!\r\nWhile we thought we were embracing a substance we grasped an empty\r\nnothing. The whole amount that was in the nest of trunks was only one\r\ndollar and a half; and all that the man possessed would not pay for\r\nhis coffin. Our sudden and exquisite joy was now succeeded by a sudden\r\nand exquisite pain; and my Captain and I exhibited, for some time,\r\nmost ridiculous figures--pictures of chagrin and disappointment! We\r\nwent away greatly mortified, and left the deceased to do as well as he\r\ncould for himself, as we had taken so good care of him when alive for\r\nnothing. We set sail once more for Montserrat, and arrived there safe;\r\nbut much out of humour with our friend the silversmith. When we had\r\nunladen the vessel, and I had sold my venture, finding myself master\r\nof about forty-seven pounds, I consulted my true friend, the Captain,\r\nhow I should proceed in offering my master the money for my freedom.\r\nHe told me to come on a certain morning, when he and my master would\r\nbe at breakfast together. Accordingly, on that morning I went, and met\r\nthe Captain there, as he had appointed. When I went in I made my\r\nobeisance to my master, and with my money in my hand, and many fears\r\nin my heart, I prayed him to be as good as his offer to me, when he\r\nwas pleased to promise me my freedom as soon as I could purchase it.\r\nThis speech seemed to confound him; he began to recoil: and my heart\r\nthat instant sunk within me. \'What,\' said he, \'give you your freedom?\r\nWhy, where did you get the money? Have you got forty pounds sterling?\'\r\n\'Yes, sir,\' I answered. \'How did you get it?\' replied he. I told him,\r\nvery honestly. The Captain then said he knew I got the money very\r\nhonestly and with much industry, and that I was particularly careful.\r\nOn which my master replied, I got money much faster than he did; and\r\nsaid he would not have made me the promise he did if he had thought I\r\nshould have got money so soon. \'Come, come,\' said my worthy Captain,\r\nclapping my master on the back, \'Come, Robert, (which was his name) I\r\nthink you must let him have his freedom; you have laid your money out\r\nvery well; you have received good interest for it all this time, and\r\nhere is now the principal at last. I know Gustavus has earned you more\r\nthan an hundred a-year, and he will still save you money, as he will\r\nnot leave you:--Come, Robert, take the money.\' My master then said, he\r\nwould not be worse than his promise; and, taking the money, told me to\r\ngo to the Secretary at the Register Office, and get my manumission\r\ndrawn up. These words of my master were like a voice from heaven to\r\nme: in an instant all my trepidation was turned into unutterable\r\nbliss; and I most reverently bowed myself with gratitude, unable to\r\nexpress my feelings, but by the overflowing of my eyes, while my true\r\nand worthy friend, the Captain, congratulated us both with a peculiar\r\ndegree of heartfelt pleasure. As soon as the first transports of my\r\njoy were over, and that I had expressed my thanks to these my worthy\r\nfriends in the best manner I was able, I rose with a heart full of\r\naffection and reverence, and left the room, in order to obey my\r\nmaster\'s joyful mandate of going to the Register Office. As I was\r\nleaving the house I called to mind the words of the Psalmist, in the\r\n126th Psalm, and like him, \'I glorified God in my heart, in whom I\r\ntrusted.\' These words had been impressed on my mind from the very day\r\nI was forced from Deptford to the present hour, and I now saw them, as\r\nI thought, fulfilled and verified. My imagination was all rapture as I\r\nflew to the Register Office, and, in this respect, like the apostle\r\nPeter,[U] (whose deliverance from prison was so sudden and\r\nextraordinary, that he thought he was in a vision) I could scarcely\r\nbelieve I was awake. Heavens! who could do justice to my feelings at\r\nthis moment! Not conquering heroes themselves, in the midst of a\r\ntriumph--Not the tender mother who has just regained her long-lost\r\ninfant, and presses it to her heart--Not the weary hungry mariner, at\r\nthe sight of the desired friendly port--Not the lover, when he once\r\nmore embraces his beloved mistress, after she had been ravished from\r\nhis arms!--All within my breast was tumult, wildness, and delirium! My\r\nfeet scarcely touched the ground, for they were winged with joy, and,\r\nlike Elijah, as he rose to Heaven, they \'were with lightning sped as I\r\nwent on.\' Every one I met I told of my happiness, and blazed about the\r\nvirtue of my amiable master and captain.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the office and acquainted the Register with my errand he\r\ncongratulated me on the occasion, and told me he would draw up my\r\nmanumission for half price, which was a guinea. I thanked him for his\r\nkindness; and, having received it and paid him, I hastened to my\r\nmaster to get him to sign it, that I might be fully released.\r\nAccordingly he signed the manumission that day, so that, before night,\r\nI who had been a slave in the morning, trembling at the will of\r\nanother, was become my own master, and completely free. I thought this\r\nwas the happiest day I had ever experienced; and my joy was still\r\nheightened by the blessings and prayers of the sable race,\r\nparticularly the aged, to whom my heart had ever been attached with\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the form of my manumission has something peculiar in it, and\r\nexpresses the absolute power and dominion one man claims over his\r\nfellow, I shall beg leave to present it before my readers at full\r\nlength:\r\n\r\n     _Montserrat_.--To all men unto whom these presents shall\r\n     come: I Robert King, of the parish of St. Anthony in the\r\n     said island, merchant, send greeting: Know ye, that I the\r\n     aforesaid Robert King, for and in consideration of the sum\r\n     of seventy pounds current money of the said island, to me in\r\n     hand paid, and to the intent that a negro man-slave, named\r\n     Gustavus Vassa, shall and may become free, have manumitted,\r\n     emancipated, enfranchised, and set free, and by these\r\n     presents do manumit, emancipate, enfranchise, and set free,\r\n     the aforesaid negro man-slave, named Gustavus Vassa, for\r\n     ever, hereby giving, granting, and releasing unto him, the\r\n     said Gustavus Vassa, all right, title, dominion,\r\n     sovereignty, and property, which, as lord and master over\r\n     the aforesaid Gustavus Vassa, I had, or now I have, or by\r\n     any means whatsoever I may or can hereafter possibly have\r\n     over him the aforesaid negro, for ever. In witness whereof I\r\n     the abovesaid Robert King have unto these presents set my\r\n     hand and seal, this tenth day of July, in the year of our\r\n     Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-six.\r\n\r\n                                          Robert King.\r\n\r\n     Signed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of Terrylegay,\r\n     Montserrat.\r\n\r\n     Registered the within manumission at full length, this\r\n     eleventh day of July, 1766, in liber D.\r\n\r\n                                 Terrylegay, Register.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn short, the fair as well as black people immediately styled me by a\r\nnew appellation, to me the most desirable in the world, which was\r\nFreeman, and at the dances I gave my Georgia superfine blue clothes\r\nmade no indifferent appearance, as I thought. Some of the sable\r\nfemales, who formerly stood aloof, now began to relax and appear less\r\ncoy; but my heart was still fixed on London, where I hoped to be ere\r\nlong. So that my worthy captain and his owner, my late master,\r\nfinding that the bent of my mind was towards London, said to me, \'We\r\nhope you won\'t leave us, but that you will still be with the vessels.\'\r\nHere gratitude bowed me down; and none but the generous mind can judge\r\nof my feelings, struggling between inclination and duty. However,\r\nnotwithstanding my wish to be in London, I obediently answered my\r\nbenefactors that I would go in the vessel, and not leave them; and\r\nfrom that day I was entered on board as an able-bodied sailor, at\r\nthirty-six shillings per month, besides what perquisites I could make.\r\nMy intention was to make a voyage or two, entirely to please these my\r\nhonoured patrons; but I determined that the year following, if it\r\npleased God, I would see Old England once more, and surprise my old\r\nmaster, Capt. Pascal, who was hourly in my mind; for I still loved\r\nhim, notwithstanding his usage of me, and I pleased myself with\r\nthinking of what he would say when he saw what the Lord had done for\r\nme in so short a time, instead of being, as he might perhaps suppose,\r\nunder the cruel yoke of some planter. With these kind of reveries I\r\nused often to entertain myself, and shorten the time till my return;\r\nand now, being as in my original free African state, I embarked on\r\nboard the Nancy, after having got all things ready for our voyage. In\r\nthis state of serenity we sailed for St. Eustatia; and, having smooth\r\nseas and calm weather, we soon arrived there: after taking our cargo\r\non board, we proceeded to Savannah in Georgia, in August, 1766. While\r\nwe were there, as usual, I used to go for the cargo up the rivers in\r\nboats; and on this business I have been frequently beset by\r\nalligators, which were very numerous on that coast, and I have shot\r\nmany of them when they have been near getting into our boats; which we\r\nhave with great difficulty sometimes prevented, and have been very\r\nmuch frightened at them. I have seen a young one sold in Georgia alive\r\nfor six pence. During our stay at this place, one evening a slave\r\nbelonging to Mr. Read, a merchant of Savannah, came near our vessel,\r\nand began to use me very ill. I entreated him, with all the patience I\r\nwas master of, to desist, as I knew there was little or no law for a\r\nfree negro here; but the fellow, instead of taking my advice,\r\npersevered in his insults, and even struck me. At this I lost all\r\ntemper, and I fell on him and beat him soundly. The next morning his\r\nmaster came to our vessel as we lay alongside the wharf, and desired\r\nme to come ashore that he might have me flogged all round the town,\r\nfor beating his negro slave. I told him he had insulted me, and had\r\ngiven the provocation, by first striking me. I had told my captain\r\nalso the whole affair that morning, and wished him to have gone along\r\nwith me to Mr. Read, to prevent bad consequences; but he said that it\r\ndid not signify, and if Mr. Read said any thing he would make matters\r\nup, and had desired me to go to work, which I accordingly did. The\r\nCaptain being on board when Mr. Read came, he told him I was a free\r\nman; and when Mr. Read applied to him to deliver me up, he said he\r\nknew nothing of the matter. I was astonished and frightened at this,\r\nand thought I had better keep where I was than go ashore and be\r\nflogged round the town, without judge or jury. I therefore refused to\r\nstir; and Mr. Read went away, swearing he would bring all the\r\nconstables in the town, for he would have me out of the vessel. When\r\nhe was gone, I thought his threat might prove too true to my sorrow;\r\nand I was confirmed in this belief, as well by the many instances I\r\nhad seen of the treatment of free negroes, as from a fact that had\r\nhappened within my own knowledge here a short time before. There was a\r\nfree black man, a carpenter, that I knew, who, for asking a gentleman\r\nthat he worked for for the money he had earned, was put into gaol; and\r\nafterwards this oppressed man was sent from Georgia, with false\r\naccusations, of an intention to set the gentleman\'s house on fire, and\r\nrun away with his slaves. I was therefore much embarrassed, and very\r\napprehensive of a flogging at least. I dreaded, of all things, the\r\nthoughts of being striped, as I never in my life had the marks of any\r\nviolence of that kind. At that instant a rage seized my soul, and for\r\na little I determined to resist the first man that should offer to lay\r\nviolent hands on me, or basely use me without a trial; for I would\r\nsooner die like a free man, than suffer myself to be scourged by the\r\nhands of ruffians, and my blood drawn like a slave. The captain and\r\nothers, more cautious, advised me to make haste and conceal myself;\r\nfor they said Mr. Read was a very spiteful man, and he would soon come\r\non board with constables and take me. At first I refused this counsel,\r\nbeing determined to stand my ground; but at length, by the prevailing\r\nentreaties of the captain and Mr. Dixon, with whom he lodged, I went\r\nto Mr. Dixon\'s house, which was a little out of town, at a place\r\ncalled Yea-ma-chra. I was but just gone when Mr. Read, with the\r\nconstables, came for me, and searched the vessel; but, not finding me\r\nthere, he swore he would have me dead or alive. I was secreted about\r\nfive days; however, the good character which my captain always gave me\r\nas well as some other gentlemen who also knew me, procured me some\r\nfriends. At last some of them told my captain that he did not use me\r\nwell, in suffering me thus to be imposed upon, and said they would see\r\nme redressed, and get me on board some other vessel. My captain, on\r\nthis, immediately went to Mr. Read, and told him, that ever since I\r\neloped from the vessel his work had been neglected, and he could not\r\ngo on with her loading, himself and mate not being well; and, as I had\r\nmanaged things on board for them, my absence must retard his voyage,\r\nand consequently hurt the owner; he therefore begged of him to forgive\r\nme, as he said he never had any complaint of me before, for the many\r\nyears that I had been with him. After repeated entreaties, Mr. Read\r\nsaid I might go to hell, and that he would not meddle with me; on\r\nwhich my captain came immediately to me at his lodging, and, telling\r\nme how pleasantly matters had gone on, he desired me to go on board.\r\nSome of my other friends then asked him if he had got the constable\'s\r\nwarrant from them; the captain said, No. On this I was desired by them\r\nto stay in the house; and they said they would get me on board of some\r\nother vessel before the evening. When the captain heard this he became\r\nalmost distracted. He went immediately for the warrant, and, after\r\nusing every exertion in his power, he at last got it from my hunters;\r\nbut I had all the expenses to pay. After I had thanked all my friends\r\nfor their attention, I went on board again to my work, of which I had\r\nalways plenty. We were in haste to complete our lading, and were to\r\ncarry twenty head of cattle with us to the West Indies, where they are\r\na very profitable article. In order to encourage me in working, and to\r\nmake up for the time I had lost, my captain promised me the privilege\r\nof carrying two bullocks of my own with me; and this made me work with\r\nredoubled ardour. As soon as I had got the vessel loaded, in doing\r\nwhich I was obliged to perform the duty of the mate as well as my own\r\nwork, and that the bullocks were near coming on board, I asked the\r\ncaptain leave to bring my two, according to his promise; but, to my\r\ngreat surprise, he told me there was no room for them. I then asked\r\nhim to permit me to take one; but he said he could not. I was a good\r\ndeal mortified at this usage, and told him I had no notion that he\r\nintended thus to impose on me; nor could I think well of any man that\r\nwas so much worse than his word. On this we had some disagreement, and\r\nI gave him to understand, that I intended to leave the vessel. At this\r\nhe appeared to be very much dejected; and our mate, who had been very\r\nsickly, and whose duty had long devolved upon me, advised him to\r\npersuade me to stay: in consequence of which he spoke very kindly to\r\nme, making many fair promises, telling me that, as the mate was so\r\nsickly, he could not do without me, and that, as the safety of the\r\nvessel and cargo depended greatly upon me, he therefore hoped that I\r\nwould not be offended at what had passed between us, and swore he\r\nwould make up all matters when we arrived in the West Indies; so I\r\nconsented to slave on as before. Soon after this, as the bullocks were\r\ncoming on board, one of them ran at the captain, and butted him so\r\nfuriously in the breast, that he never recovered of the blow. In order\r\nto make me some amends for his treatment about the bullocks, the\r\ncaptain now pressed me very much to take some turkeys, and other\r\nfowls, with me, and gave me liberty to take as many as I could find\r\nroom for; but I told him he knew very well I had never carried any\r\nturkeys before, as I always thought they were such tender birds that\r\nthey were not fit to cross the seas. However, he continued to press me\r\nto buy them for once; and, what was very surprising to me, the more I\r\nwas against it, the more he urged my taking them, insomuch that he\r\nensured me from all losses that might happen by them, and I was\r\nprevailed on to take them; but I thought this very strange, as he had\r\nnever acted so with me before. This, and not being able to dispose of\r\nmy paper-money in any other way, induced me at length to take four\r\ndozen. The turkeys, however, I was so dissatisfied about that I\r\ndetermined to make no more voyages to this quarter, nor with this\r\ncaptain; and was very apprehensive that my free voyage would be the\r\nworst I had ever made. We set sail for Montserrat. The captain and\r\nmate had been both complaining of sickness when we sailed, and as we\r\nproceeded on our voyage they grew worse. This was about November, and\r\nwe had not been long at sea before we began to meet with strong\r\nnortherly gales and rough seas; and in about seven or eight days all\r\nthe bullocks were near being drowned, and four or five of them died.\r\nOur vessel, which had not been tight at first, was much less so now;\r\nand, though we were but nine in the whole, including five sailors and\r\nmyself, yet we were obliged to attend to the pumps every half or three\r\nquarters of an hour. The captain and mate came on deck as often as\r\nthey were able, which was now but seldom; for they declined so fast,\r\nthat they were not well enough to make observations above four or five\r\ntimes the whole voyage. The whole care of the vessel rested,\r\ntherefore, upon me, and I was obliged to direct her by my former\r\nexperience, not being able to work a traverse. The captain was now\r\nvery sorry he had not taught me navigation, and protested, if ever he\r\nshould get well again, he would not fail to do so; but in about\r\nseventeen days his illness increased so much, that he was obliged to\r\nkeep his bed, continuing sensible, however, till the last, constantly\r\nhaving the owner\'s interest at heart; for this just and benevolent man\r\never appeared much concerned about the welfare of what he was\r\nintrusted with. When this dear friend found the symptoms of death\r\napproaching, he called me by my name; and, when I came to him, he\r\nasked (with almost his last breath) if he had ever done me any harm?\r\n\'God forbid I should think so,\' I replied, \'I should then be the most\r\nungrateful of wretches to the best of sorrow by his bedside, he\r\nexpired without saying another word; and the day following we\r\ncommitted his body to the deep. Every man on board loved this man, and\r\nregretted his death; but I was exceedingly affected at it, and I found\r\nthat I did not know, till he was gone, the strength of my regard for\r\nhim. Indeed I had every reason in the world to be attached to him;\r\nfor, besides that he was in general mild, affable, generous, faithful,\r\nbenevolent, and just, he was to me a friend and a father; and, had it\r\npleased Providence that he had died but five months before, I verily\r\nbelieve I should not have obtained my freedom when I did; and it is\r\nnot improbable that I might not have been able to get it at any rate\r\nafterwards. The captain being dead, the mate came on the deck, and\r\nmade such observations as he was able, but to no purpose. In the\r\ncourse of a few days more, the few bullocks that remained were found\r\ndead; but the turkies I had, though on the deck, and exposed to so\r\nmuch wet and bad weather, did well, and I afterwards gained near three\r\nhundred per cent, on the sale of them; so that in the event it proved\r\na happy circumstance for me that I had not bought the bullocks I\r\nintended, for they must have perished with the rest; and I could not\r\nhelp looking on this, otherwise trifling circumstance, as a particular\r\nprovidence of God, and I was thankful accordingly. The care of the\r\nvessel took up all my time, and engaged my attention entirely. As we\r\nwere now out of the variable winds, I thought I should not be much\r\npuzzled to hit upon the islands. I was persuaded I steered right for\r\nAntigua, which I wished to reach, as the nearest to us; and in the\r\ncourse of nine or ten days we made this island, to our great joy; and\r\nthe next day after we came safe to Montserrat. Many were surprised\r\nwhen they heard of my conducting the sloop into the port, and I now\r\nobtained a new appellation, and was called Captain. This elated me not\r\na little, and it was quite flattering to my vanity to be thus styled\r\nby as high a title as any free man in this place possessed. When the\r\ndeath of the captain became known, he was much regretted by all who\r\nknew him; for he was a man universally respected. At the same time the\r\nsable captain lost no fame; for the success I had met with increased\r\nthe affection of my friends in no small measure.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: Acts, chap. xii. ver. 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

I began to think of leaving this part of the\r\nworld, of which I had been long tired, and returning to England, where\r\nmy heart had always been; but Mr. King still pressed me very much to\r\nstay with his vessel; and he had done so much for me that I found\r\nmyself unable to refuse his requests, and consented to go another\r\nvoyage to Georgia, as the mate, from his ill state of health, was\r\nquite useless in the vessel. Accordingly a new captain was appointed,\r\nwhose name was William Phillips, an old acquaintance of mine; and,\r\nhaving refitted our vessel, and taken several slaves on board, we set\r\nsail for St. Eustatia, where we stayed but a few days; and on the 30th\r\nof January 1767 we steered for Georgia. Our new captain boasted\r\nstrangely of his skill in navigating and conducting a vessel; and in\r\nconsequence of this he steered a new course, several points more to\r\nthe westward than we ever did before; this appeared to me very\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of February, which was soon after we had got into our\r\nnew course, I dreamt the ship was wrecked amidst the surfs and rocks,\r\nand that I was the means of saving every one on board; and on the\r\nnight following I dreamed the very same dream. These dreams however\r\nmade no impression on my mind; and the next evening, it being my watch\r\nbelow, I was pumping the vessel a little after eight o\'clock, just\r\nbefore I went off the deck, as is the custom; and being weary with the\r\nduty of the day, and tired at the pump, (for we made a good deal of\r\nwater) I began to express my impatience, and I uttered with an oath,\r\n\'Damn the vessel\'s bottom out.\' But my conscience instantly smote me\r\nfor the expression. When I left the deck I went to bed, and had\r\nscarcely fallen asleep when I dreamed the same dream again about the\r\nship that I had dreamt the two preceeding nights. At twelve o\'clock\r\nthe watch was changed; and, as I had always the charge of the\r\ncaptain\'s watch, I then went upon deck. At half after one in the\r\nmorning the man at the helm saw something under the lee-beam that the\r\nsea washed against, and he immediately called to me that there was a\r\ngrampus, and desired me to look at it. Accordingly I stood up and\r\nobserved it for some time; but, when I saw the sea wash up against it\r\nagain and again, I said it was not a fish but a rock. Being soon\r\ncertain of this, I went down to the captain, and, with some confusion,\r\ntold him the danger we were in, and desired him to come upon deck\r\nimmediately. He said it was very well, and I went up again. As soon as\r\nI was upon deck the wind, which had been pretty high, having abated a\r\nlittle, the vessel began to be carried sideways towards the rock, by\r\nmeans of the current. Still the captain did not appear. I therefore\r\nwent to him again, and told him the vessel was then near a large rock,\r\nand desired he would come up with speed. He said he would, and I\r\nreturned to the deck. When I was upon the deck again I saw we were not\r\nabove a pistol shot from the rock, and I heard the noise of the\r\nbreakers all around us. I was exceedingly alarmed at this; and the\r\ncaptain having not yet come on the deck I lost all patience; and,\r\ngrowing quite enraged, I ran down to him again, and asked him why he\r\ndid not come up, and what he could mean by all this? \'The breakers,\'\r\nsaid I, \'are round us, and the vessel is almost on the rock.\' With\r\nthat he came on the deck with me, and we tried to put the vessel\r\nabout, and get her out of the current, but all to no purpose, the\r\nwind being very small. We then called all hands up immediately; and\r\nafter a little we got up one end of a cable, and fastened it to the\r\nanchor. By this time the surf was foaming round us, and made a\r\ndreadful noise on the breakers, and the very moment we let the anchor\r\ngo the vessel struck against the rocks. One swell now succeeded\r\nanother, as it were one wave calling on its fellow: the roaring of the\r\nbillows increased, and, with one single heave of the swells, the sloop\r\nwas pierced and transfixed among the rocks! In a moment a scene of\r\nhorror presented itself to my mind, such as I never had conceived or\r\nexperienced before. All my sins stared me in the face; and especially,\r\nI thought that God had hurled his direful vengeance on my guilty head\r\nfor cursing the vessel on which my life depended. My spirits at this\r\nforsook me, and I expected every moment to go to the bottom: I\r\ndetermined if I should still be saved that I would never swear again.\r\nAnd in the midst of my distress, while the dreadful surfs were dashing\r\nwith unremitting fury among the rocks, I remembered the Lord, though\r\nfearful that I was undeserving of forgiveness, and I thought that as\r\nhe had often delivered he might yet deliver; and, calling to mind the\r\nmany mercies he had shewn me in times past, they gave me some small\r\nhope that he might still help me. I then began to think how we might\r\nbe saved; and I believe no mind was ever like mine so replete with\r\ninventions and confused with schemes, though how to escape death I\r\nknew not. The captain immediately ordered the hatches to be nailed\r\ndown on the slaves in the hold, where there were above twenty, all of\r\nwhom must unavoidably have perished if he had been obeyed. When he\r\ndesired the man to nail down the hatches I thought that my sin was the\r\ncause of this, and that God would charge me with these people\'s blood.\r\nThis thought rushed upon my mind that instant with such violence, that\r\nit quite overpowered me, and I fainted. I recovered just as the people\r\nwere about to nail down the hatches; perceiving which, I desired them\r\nto stop. The captain then said it must be done: I asked him why? He\r\nsaid that every one would endeavour to get into the boat, which was\r\nbut small, and thereby we should be drowned; for it would not have\r\ncarried above ten at the most. I could no longer restrain my emotion,\r\nand I told him he deserved drowning for not knowing how to navigate\r\nthe vessel; and I believe the people would have tossed him overboard\r\nif I had given them the least hint of it. However the hatches were not\r\nnailed down; and, as none of us could leave the vessel then on account\r\nof the darkness, and as we knew not where to go, and were convinced\r\nbesides that the boat could not survive the surfs, we all said we\r\nwould remain on the dry part of the vessel, and trust to God till\r\ndaylight appeared, when we should know better what to do.\r\n\r\nI then advised to get the boat prepared against morning, and some of\r\nus began to set about it; but some abandoned all care of the ship and\r\nthemselves, and fell to drinking. Our boat had a piece out of her\r\nbottom near two feet long, and we had no materials to mend her;\r\nhowever, necessity being the mother of invention, I took some pump\r\nleather and nailed it to the broken part, and plastered it over with\r\ntallow-grease. And, thus prepared, with the utmost anxiety of mind we\r\nwatched for daylight, and thought every minute an hour till it\r\nappeared. At last it saluted our longing eyes, and kind Providence\r\naccompanied its approach with what was no small comfort to us; for the\r\ndreadful swell began to subside; and the next thing that we discovered\r\nto raise our drooping spirits, was a small key or island, about five\r\nor six miles off; but a barrier soon presented itself; for there was\r\nnot water enough for our boat to go over the reefs, and this threw us\r\nagain into a sad consternation; but there was no alternative, we were\r\ntherefore obliged to put but few in the boat at once; and, what is\r\nstill worse, all of us were frequently under the necessity of getting\r\nout to drag and lift it over the reefs. This cost us much labour and\r\nfatigue; and, what was yet more distressing, we could not avoid having\r\nour legs cut and torn very much with the rocks. There were only four\r\npeople that would work with me at the oars; and they consisted of\r\nthree black men and a Dutch Creole sailor; and, though we went with\r\nthe boat five times that day, we had no others to assist us. But, had\r\nwe not worked in this manner, I really believe the people could not\r\nhave been saved; for not one of the white men did any thing to\r\npreserve their lives; and indeed they soon got so drunk that they were\r\nnot able, but lay about the deck like swine, so that we were at last\r\nobliged to lift them into the boat and carry them on shore by force.\r\nThis want of assistance made our labour intolerably severe; insomuch,\r\nthat, by putting on shore so often that day, the skin was entirely\r\nstript off my hands.\r\n\r\nHowever, we continued all the day to toil and strain our exertions,\r\ntill we had brought all on board safe to the shore; so that out of\r\nthirty-two people we lost not one. My dream now returned upon my mind\r\nwith all its force; it was fulfilled in every part; for our danger was\r\nthe same I had dreamt of: and I could not help looking on myself as\r\nthe principal instrument in effecting our deliverance; for, owing to\r\nsome of our people getting drunk, the rest of us were obliged to\r\ndouble our exertions; and it was fortunate we did, for in a very\r\nlittle time longer the patch of leather on the boat would have been\r\nworn out, and she would have been no longer fit for service. Situated\r\nas we were, who could think that men should be so careless of the\r\ndanger they were in? for, if the wind had but raised the swell as it\r\nwas when the vessel struck, we must have bid a final farewell to all\r\nhopes of deliverance; and though, I warned the people who were\r\ndrinking and entreated them to embrace the moment of deliverance,\r\nnevertheless they persisted, as if not possessed of the least spark of\r\nreason. I could not help thinking, that, if any of these people had\r\nbeen lost, God would charge me with their lives, which, perhaps, was\r\none cause of my labouring so hard for their preservation, and indeed\r\nevery one of them afterwards seemed so sensible of the service I had\r\nrendered them; and while we were on the key I was a kind of chieftain\r\namongst them. I brought some limes, oranges, and lemons ashore; and,\r\nfinding it to be a good soil where we were, I planted several of them\r\nas a token to any one that might be cast away hereafter. This key, as\r\nwe afterwards found, was one of the Bahama islands, which consist of a\r\ncluster of large islands, with smaller ones or keys, as they are\r\ncalled, interspersed among them. It was about a mile in circumference,\r\nwith a white sandy beach running in a regular order along it. On that\r\npart of it where we first attempted to land there stood some very\r\nlarge birds, called flamingoes: these, from the reflection of the sun,\r\nappeared to us at a little distance as large as men; and, when they\r\nwalked backwards and forwards, we could not conceive what they were:\r\nour captain swore they were cannibals. This created a great panic\r\namong us; and we held a consultation how to act. The captain wanted to\r\ngo to a key that was within sight, but a great way off; but I was\r\nagainst it, as in so doing we should not be able to save all the\r\npeople; \'And therefore,\' said I, \'let us go on shore here, and perhaps\r\nthese cannibals may take to the water.\' Accordingly we steered towards\r\nthem; and when we approached them, to our very great joy and no less\r\nwonder, they walked off one after the other very deliberately; and at\r\nlast they took flight and relieved us entirely from our fears. About\r\nthe key there were turtles and several sorts of fish in such abundance\r\nthat we caught them without bait, which was a great relief to us after\r\nthe salt provisions on board. There was also a large rock on the\r\nbeach, about ten feet high, which was in the form of a punch-bowl at\r\nthe top; this we could not help thinking Providence had ordained to\r\nsupply us with rainwater; and it was something singular that, if we\r\ndid not take the water when it rained, in some little time after it\r\nwould turn as salt as sea-water.\r\n\r\nOur first care, after refreshment, was to make ourselves tents to\r\nlodge in, which we did as well as we could with some sails we had\r\nbrought from the ship. We then began to think how we might get from\r\nthis place, which was quite uninhabited; and we determined to repair\r\nour boat, which was very much shattered, and to put to sea in quest of\r\na ship or some inhabited island. It took us up however eleven days\r\nbefore we could get the boat ready for sea in the manner we wanted it,\r\nwith a sail and other necessaries. When we had got all things prepared\r\nthe captain wanted me to stay on shore while he went to sea in quest\r\nof a vessel to take all the people off the key; but this I refused;\r\nand the captain and myself, with five more, set off in the boat\r\ntowards New Providence. We had no more than two musket load of\r\ngunpowder with us if any thing should happen; and our stock of\r\nprovisions consisted of three gallons of rum, four of water, some salt\r\nbeef, some biscuit; and in this manner we proceeded to sea.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of our voyage we came to an island called Obbico,\r\nthe largest of the Bahama islands. We were much in want of water; for\r\nby this time our water was expended, and we were exceedingly fatigued\r\nin pulling two days in the heat of the sun; and it being late in the\r\nevening, we hauled the boat ashore to try for water and remain during\r\nthe night: when we came ashore we searched for water, but could find\r\nnone. When it was dark, we made a fire around us for fear of the wild\r\nbeasts, as the place was an entire thick wood, and we took it by turns\r\nto watch. In this situation we found very little rest, and waited with\r\nimpatience for the morning. As soon as the light appeared we set off\r\nagain with our boat, in hopes of finding assistance during the day. We\r\nwere now much dejected and weakened by pulling the boat; for our sail\r\nwas of no use, and we were almost famished for want of fresh water to\r\ndrink. We had nothing left to eat but salt beef, and that we could not\r\nuse without water. In this situation we toiled all day in sight of the\r\nisland, which was very long; in the evening, seeing no relief, we made\r\nashore again, and fastened our boat. We then went to look for fresh\r\nwater, being quite faint for the want of it; and we dug and searched\r\nabout for some all the remainder of the evening, but could not find\r\none drop, so that our dejection at this period became excessive, and\r\nour terror so great, that we expected nothing but death to deliver us.\r\nWe could not touch our beef, which was as salt as brine, without fresh\r\nwater; and we were in the greatest terror from the apprehension of\r\nwild beasts. When unwelcome night came we acted as on the night\r\nbefore; and the next morning we set off again from the island in hopes\r\nof seeing some vessel. In this manner we toiled as well as we were\r\nable till four o\'clock, during which we passed several keys, but could\r\nnot meet with a ship; and, still famishing with thirst, went ashore on\r\none of those keys again in hopes of finding some water. Here we found\r\nsome leaves with a few drops of water in them, which we lapped with\r\nmuch eagerness; we then dug in several places, but without success. As\r\nwe were digging holes in search of water there came forth some very\r\nthick and black stuff; but none of us could touch it, except the poor\r\nDutch Creole, who drank above a quart of it as eagerly as if it had\r\nbeen wine. We tried to catch fish, but could not; and we now began to\r\nrepine at our fate, and abandon ourselves to despair; when, in the\r\nmidst of our murmuring, the captain all at once cried out \'A sail! a\r\nsail! a sail!\' This gladdening sound was like a reprieve to a\r\nconvict, and we all instantly turned to look at it; but in a little\r\ntime some of us began to be afraid it was not a sail. However, at a\r\nventure, we embarked and steered after it; and, in half an hour, to\r\nour unspeakable joy, we plainly saw that it was a vessel. At this our\r\ndrooping spirits revived, and we made towards her with all the speed\r\nimaginable. When we came near to her, we found she was a little sloop,\r\nabout the size of a Gravesend hoy, and quite full of people; a\r\ncircumstance which we could not make out the meaning of. Our captain,\r\nwho was a Welchman, swore that they were pirates, and would kill us. I\r\nsaid, be that as it might, we must board her if we were to die for it;\r\nand, if they should not receive us kindly, we must oppose them as well\r\nas we could; for there was no alternative between their perishing and\r\nours. This counsel was immediately taken; and I really believe that\r\nthe captain, myself, and the Dutchman, would then have faced twenty\r\nmen. We had two cutlasses and a musquet, that I brought in the boat;\r\nand, in this situation, we rowed alongside, and immediately boarded\r\nher. I believe there were about forty hands on board; but how great\r\nwas our surprise, as soon as we got on board, to find that the major\r\npart of them were in the same predicament as ourselves!\r\n\r\nThey belonged to a whaling schooner that was wrecked two days before\r\nus about nine miles to the north of our vessel. When she was wrecked\r\nsome of them had taken to their boats and had left some of their\r\npeople and property on a key, in the same manner as we had done; and\r\nwere going, like us, to New Providence in quest of a ship, when they\r\nmet with this little sloop, called a wrecker; their employment in\r\nthose seas being to look after wrecks. They were then going to take\r\nthe remainder of the people belonging to the schooner; for which the\r\nwrecker was to have all things belonging to the vessel, and likewise\r\ntheir people\'s help to get what they could out of her, and were then\r\nto carry the crew to New Providence.\r\n\r\nWe told the people of the wrecker the condition of our vessel, and we\r\nmade the same agreement with them as the schooner\'s people; and, on\r\ntheir complying, we begged of them to go to our key directly, because\r\nour people were in want of water. They agreed, therefore, to go along\r\nwith us first; and in two days we arrived at the key, to the\r\ninexpressible joy of the people that we had left behind, as they had\r\nbeen reduced to great extremities for want of water in our absence.\r\nLuckily for us, the wrecker had now more people on board than she\r\ncould carry or victual for any moderate length of time; they therefore\r\nhired the schooner\'s people to work on our wreck, and we left them our\r\nboat, and embarked for New Providence.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more fortunate than our meeting with this\r\nwrecker, for New Providence was at such a distance that we never could\r\nhave reached it in our boat. The island of Abbico was much longer than\r\nwe expected; and it was not till after sailing for three or four days\r\nthat we got safe to the farther end of it, towards New Providence.\r\nWhen we arrived there we watered, and got a good many lobsters and\r\nother shellfish; which proved a great relief to us, as our provisions\r\nand water were almost exhausted. We then proceeded on our voyage; but\r\nthe day after we left the island, late in the evening, and whilst we\r\nwere yet amongst the Bahama keys, we were overtaken by a violent gale\r\nof wind, so that we were obliged to cut away the mast. The vessel was\r\nvery near foundering; for she parted from her anchors, and struck\r\nseveral times on the shoals. Here we expected every minute that she\r\nwould have gone to pieces, and each moment to be our last; so much so\r\nthat my old captain and sickly useless mate, and several others,\r\nfainted; and death stared us in the face on every side. All the\r\nswearers on board now began to call on the God of Heaven to assist\r\nthem: and, sure enough, beyond our comprehension he did assist us, and\r\nin a miraculous manner delivered us! In the very height of our\r\nextremity the wind lulled for a few minutes; and, although the swell\r\nwas high beyond expression, two men, who were expert swimmers,\r\nattempted to go to the buoy of the anchor, which we still saw on the\r\nwater, at some distance, in a little punt that belonged to the\r\nwrecker, which was not large enough to carry more than two. She filled\r\ndifferent times in their endeavours to get into her alongside of our\r\nvessel; and they saw nothing but death before them, as well as we; but\r\nthey said they might as well die that way as any other. A coil of very\r\nsmall rope, with a little buoy, was put in along with them; and, at\r\nlast, with great hazard, they got the punt clear from the vessel; and\r\nthese two intrepid water heroes paddled away for life towards the buoy\r\nof the anchor. The eyes of us all were fixed on them all the time,\r\nexpecting every minute to be their last: and the prayers of all those\r\nthat remained in their senses were offered up to God, on their behalf,\r\nfor a speedy deliverance; and for our own, which depended on them; and\r\nhe heard and answered us! These two men at last reached the buoy; and,\r\nhaving fastened the punt to it, they tied one end of their rope to the\r\nsmall buoy that they had in the punt, and sent it adrift towards the\r\nvessel. We on board observing this threw out boat-hooks and leads\r\nfastened to lines, in order to catch the buoy: at last we caught it,\r\nand fastened a hawser to the end of the small rope; we then gave them\r\na sign to pull, and they pulled the hawser to them, and fastened it to\r\nthe buoy: which being done we hauled for our lives; and, through the\r\nmercy of God, we got again from the shoals into deep water, and the\r\npunt got safe to the vessel. It is impossible for any to conceive our\r\nheartfelt joy at this second deliverance from ruin, but those who have\r\nsuffered the same hardships. Those whose strength and senses were gone\r\ncame to themselves, and were now as elated as they were before\r\ndepressed. Two days after this the wind ceased, and the water became\r\nsmooth. The punt then went on shore, and we cut down some trees; and\r\nhaving found our mast and mended it we brought it on board, and fixed\r\nit up. As soon as we had done this we got up the anchor, and away we\r\nwent once more for New Providence, which in three days more we reached\r\nsafe, after having been above three weeks in a situation in which we\r\ndid not expect to escape with life. The inhabitants here were very\r\nkind to us; and, when they learned our situation, shewed us a great\r\ndeal of hospitality and friendship. Soon after this every one of my\r\nold fellow-sufferers that were free parted from us, and shaped their\r\ncourse where their inclination led them. One merchant, who had a large\r\nsloop, seeing our condition, and knowing we wanted to go to Georgia,\r\ntold four of us that his vessel was going there; and, if we would work\r\non board and load her, he would give us our passage free. As we could\r\nnot get any wages whatever, and found it very hard to get off the\r\nplace, we were obliged to consent to his proposal; and we went on\r\nboard and helped to load the sloop, though we had only our victuals\r\nallowed us. When she was entirely loaded he told us she was going to\r\nJamaica first, where we must go if we went in her. This, however, I\r\nrefused; but my fellow-sufferers not having any money to help\r\nthemselves with, necessity obliged them to accept of the offer, and to\r\nsteer that course, though they did not like it.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in New Providence about seventeen or eighteen days; during\r\nwhich time I met with many friends, who gave me encouragement to stay\r\nthere with them: but I declined it; though, had not my heart been\r\nfixed on England, I should have stayed, as I liked the place\r\nextremely, and there were some free black people here who were very\r\nhappy, and we passed our time pleasantly together, with the melodious\r\nsound of the catguts, under the lime and lemon trees. At length\r\nCaptain Phillips hired a sloop to carry him and some of the slaves\r\nthat he could not sell to Georgia; and I agreed to go with him in this\r\nvessel, meaning now to take my farewell of that place. When the vessel\r\nwas ready we all embarked; and I took my leave of New Providence, not\r\nwithout regret. We sailed about four o\'clock in the morning, with a\r\nfair wind, for Georgia; and about eleven o\'clock the same morning a\r\nshort and sudden gale sprung up and blew away most of our sails; and,\r\nas we were still amongst the keys, in a very few minutes it dashed the\r\nsloop against the rocks. Luckily for us the water was deep; and the\r\nsea was not so angry but that, after having for some time laboured\r\nhard, and being many in number, we were saved through God\'s mercy;\r\nand, by using our greatest exertions, we got the vessel off. The next\r\nday we returned to Providence, where we soon got her again refitted.\r\nSome of the people swore that we had spells set upon us by somebody in\r\nMontserrat; and others that we had witches and wizzards amongst the\r\npoor helpless slaves; and that we never should arrive safe at Georgia.\r\nBut these things did not deter me; I said, \'Let us again face the\r\nwinds and seas, and swear not, but trust to God, and he will deliver\r\nus.\' We therefore once more set sail; and, with hard labour, in seven\r\nday\'s time arrived safe at Georgia.\r\n\r\nAfter our arrival we went up to the town of Savannah; and the same\r\nevening I went to a friend\'s house to lodge, whose name was Mosa, a\r\nblack man. We were very happy at meeting each other; and after supper\r\nwe had a light till it was between nine and ten o\'clock at night.\r\nAbout that time the watch or patrol came by; and, discerning a light\r\nin the house, they knocked at the door: we opened it; and they came in\r\nand sat down, and drank some punch with us: they also begged some\r\nlimes of me, as they understood I had some, which I readily gave them.\r\nA little after this they told me I must go to the watch-house with\r\nthem: this surprised me a good deal, after our kindness to them; and I\r\nasked them, Why so? They said that all negroes who had light in their\r\nhouses after nine o\'clock were to be taken into custody, and either\r\npay some dollars or be flogged. Some of those people knew that I was a\r\nfree man; but, as the man of the house was not free, and had his\r\nmaster to protect him, they did not take the same liberty with him\r\nthey did with me. I told them that I was a free man, and just arrived\r\nfrom Providence; that we were not making any noise, and that I was not\r\na stranger in that place, but was very well known there: \'Besides,\'\r\nsaid I, \'what will you do with me?\'--\'That you shall see,\' replied\r\nthey, \'but you must go to the watch-house with us.\' Now whether they\r\nmeant to get money from me or not I was at a loss to know; but I\r\nthought immediately of the oranges and limes at Santa Cruz: and seeing\r\nthat nothing would pacify them I went with them to the watch-house,\r\nwhere I remained during the night. Early the the next morning these\r\nimposing ruffians flogged a negro-man and woman that they had in the\r\nwatch-house, and then they told me that I must be flogged too. I asked\r\nwhy? and if there was no law for free men? And told them if there was\r\nI would have it put in force against them. But this only exasperated\r\nthem the more; and instantly they swore they would serve me as Doctor\r\nPerkins had done; and they were going to lay violent hands on me; when\r\none of them, more humane than the rest, said that as I was a free man\r\nthey could not justify stripping me by law. I then immediately sent\r\nfor Doctor Brady, who was known to be an honest and worthy man; and on\r\nhis coming to my assistance they let me go.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only disagreeable incident I met with while I was in\r\nthis place; for, one day, while I was a little way out of the town of\r\nSavannah, I was beset by two white men, who meant to play their usual\r\ntricks with me in the way of kidnapping. As soon as these men accosted\r\nme, one of them said to the other, \'This is the very fellow we are\r\nlooking for that you lost:\' and the other swore immediately that I was\r\nthe identical person. On this they made up to me, and were about to\r\nhandle me; but I told them to be still and keep off; for I had seen\r\nthose kind of tricks played upon other free blacks, and they must not\r\nthink to serve me so. At this they paused a little, and one said to\r\nthe other--it will not do; and the other answered that I talked too\r\ngood English. I replied, I believed I did; and I had also with me a\r\nrevengeful stick equal to the occasion; and my mind was likewise good.\r\nHappily however it was not used; and, after we had talked together a\r\nlittle in this manner, the rogues left me. I stayed in Savannah some\r\ntime, anxiously trying to get to Montserrat once more to see Mr. King,\r\nmy old master, and then to take a final farewell of the American\r\nquarter of the globe. At last I met with a sloop called the Speedwell,\r\nCaptain John Bunton, which belonged to Grenada, and was bound to\r\nMartinico, a French island, with a cargo of rice, and I shipped myself\r\non board of her. Before I left Georgia a black woman, who had a child\r\nlying dead, being very tenacious of the church burial service, and not\r\nable to get any white person to perform it, applied to me for that\r\npurpose. I told her I was no parson; and besides, that the service\r\nover the dead did not affect the soul. This however did not satisfy\r\nher; she still urged me very hard: I therefore complied with her\r\nearnest entreaties, and at last consented to act the parson for the\r\nfirst time in my life. As she was much respected, there was a great\r\ncompany both of white and black people at the grave. I then\r\naccordingly assumed my new vocation, and performed the funeral\r\nceremony to the satisfaction of all present; after which I bade adieu\r\nto Georgia, and sailed for Martinico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX\r\n\r\n     _The author arrives at Martinico--Meets with new\r\n     difficulties--Gets to Montserrat, where he takes leave of\r\n     his old master, and sails for England--Meets Capt.\r\n     Pascal--Learns the French horn--Hires himself with Doctor\r\n     Irving, where he learns to freshen sea water--Leaves the\r\n     doctor, and goes a voyage to Turkey and Portugal; and\r\n     afterwards goes a voyage to Grenada, and another to\r\n     Jamaica--Returns to the Doctor, and they embark together on\r\n     a voyage to the North Pole, with the Hon. Capt. Phipps--Some\r\n     account of that voyage, and the dangers the author was\r\n     in--He returns to England._\r\n\r\n\r\nI thus took a final leave of Georgia; for the treatment I had received\r\nin it disgusted me very much against the place; and when I left it and\r\nsailed for Martinico I determined never more to revisit it. My new\r\ncaptain conducted his vessel safer than my former one; and, after an\r\nagreeable voyage, we got safe to our intended port. While I was on\r\nthis island I went about a good deal, and found it very pleasant: in\r\nparticular I admired the town of St. Pierre, which is the principal\r\none in the island, and built more like an European town than any I had\r\nseen in the West Indies. In general also, slaves were better treated,\r\nhad more holidays, and looked better than those in the English\r\nislands. After we had done our business here, I wanted my discharge,\r\nwhich was necessary; for it was then the month of May, and I wished\r\nmuch to be at Montserrat to bid farewell to Mr. King, and all my other\r\nfriends there, in time to sail for Old England in the July fleet. But,\r\nalas! I had put a great stumbling block in my own way, by which I was\r\nnear losing my passage that season to England. I had lent my captain\r\nsome money, which I now wanted to enable me to prosecute my\r\nintentions. This I told him; but when I applied for it, though I urged\r\nthe necessity of my occasion, I met with so much shuffling from him,\r\nthat I began at last to be afraid of losing my money, as I could not\r\nrecover it by law: for I have already mentioned, that throughout the\r\nWest Indies no black man\'s testimony is admitted, on any occasion,\r\nagainst any white person whatever, and therefore my own oath would\r\nhave been of no use. I was obliged, therefore, to remain with him\r\ntill he might be disposed to return it to me. Thus we sailed from\r\nMartinico for the Grenades. I frequently pressing the captain for my\r\nmoney to no purpose; and, to render my condition worse, when we got\r\nthere, the captain and his owners quarrelled; so that my situation\r\nbecame daily more irksome: for besides that we on board had little or\r\nno victuals allowed us, and I could not get my money nor wages, I\r\ncould then have gotten my passage free to Montserrat had I been able\r\nto accept it. The worst of all was, that it was growing late in July,\r\nand the ships in the islands must sail by the 26th of that month. At\r\nlast, however, with a great many entreaties, I got my money from the\r\ncaptain, and took the first vessel I could meet with for St. Eustatia.\r\nFrom thence I went in another to Basseterre in St. Kitts, where I\r\narrived on the 19th of July. On the 22d, having met with a vessel\r\nbound to Montserrat, I wanted to go in her; but the captain and others\r\nwould not take me on board until I should advertise myself, and give\r\nnotice of my going off the island. I told them of my haste to be in\r\nMontserrat, and that the time then would not admit of advertising, it\r\nbeing late in the evening, and the captain about to sail; but he\r\ninsisted it was necessary, and otherwise he said he would not take me.\r\nThis reduced me to great perplexity; for if I should be compelled to\r\nsubmit to this degrading necessity, which every black freeman is\r\nunder, of advertising himself like a slave, when he leaves an island,\r\nand which I thought a gross imposition upon any freeman, I feared I\r\nshould miss that opportunity of going to Montserrat, and then I could\r\nnot get to England that year. The vessel was just going off, and no\r\ntime could be lost; I immediately therefore set about, with a heavy\r\nheart, to try who I could get to befriend me in complying with the\r\ndemands of the captain. Luckily I found, in a few minutes, some\r\ngentlemen of Montserrat whom I knew; and, having told them my\r\nsituation, I requested their friendly assistance in helping me off the\r\nisland. Some of them, on this, went with me to the captain, and\r\nsatisfied him of my freedom; and, to my very great joy, he desired me\r\nto go on board. We then set sail, and the next day, the 23d, I arrived\r\nat the wished-for place, after an absence of six months, in which I\r\nhad more than once experienced the delivering hand of Providence,\r\nwhen all human means of escaping destruction seemed hopeless. I saw my\r\nfriends with a gladness of heart which was increased by my absence and\r\nthe dangers I had escaped, and I was received with great friendship by\r\nthem all, but particularly by Mr. King, to whom I related the fate of\r\nhis sloop, the Nancy, and the causes of her being wrecked. I now\r\nlearned with extreme sorrow, that his house was washed away during my\r\nabsence, by the bursting of a pond at the top of a mountain that was\r\nopposite the town of Plymouth. It swept great part of the town away,\r\nand Mr. King lost a great deal of property from the inundation, and\r\nnearly his life. When I told him I intended to go to London that\r\nseason, and that I had come to visit him before my departure, the good\r\nman expressed a great deal of affection for me, and sorrow that I\r\nshould leave him, and warmly advised me to stay there; insisting, as I\r\nwas much respected by all the gentlemen in the place, that I might do\r\nvery well, and in a short time have land and slaves of my own. I\r\nthanked him for this instance of his friendship; but, as I wished very\r\nmuch to be in London, I declined remaining any longer there, and\r\nbegged he would excuse me. I then requested he would be kind enough to\r\ngive me a certificate of my behaviour while in his service, which he\r\nvery readily complied with, and gave me the following:\r\n\r\n                                     _Montserrat, January 26, 1767._\r\n\r\n     \'The bearer hereof, Gustavus Vassa, was my slave for upwards\r\n     of three years, during which he has always behaved himself\r\n     well, and discharged his duty with honesty and assiduity.\r\n\r\n                                                     Robert King.\r\n\r\n     \'To all whom this may concern.\'\r\n\r\nHaving obtained this, I parted from my kind master, after many sincere\r\nprofessions of gratitude and regard, and prepared for my departure for\r\nLondon. I immediately agreed to go with one Capt. John Hamer, for\r\nseven guineas, the passage to London, on board a ship called the\r\nAndromache; and on the 24th and 25th I had free dances, as they are\r\ncalled, with some of my countrymen, previous to my setting off; after\r\nwhich I took leave of all my friends, and on the 26th I embarked for\r\nLondon, exceedingly glad to see myself once more on board of a ship;\r\nand still more so, in steering the course I had long wished for. With\r\na light heart I bade Montserrat farewell, and never had my feet on it\r\nsince; and with it I bade adieu to the sound of the cruel whip, and\r\nall other dreadful instruments of torture; adieu to the offensive\r\nsight of the violated chastity of the sable females, which has too\r\noften accosted my eyes; adieu to oppressions (although to me less\r\nsevere than most of my countrymen); and adieu to the angry howling,\r\ndashing surfs. I wished for a grateful and thankful heart to praise\r\nthe Lord God on high for all his mercies!\r\n\r\nWe had a most prosperous voyage, and, at the end of seven weeks,\r\narrived at Cherry-Garden stairs. Thus were my longing eyes once more\r\ngratified with a sight of London, after having been absent from it\r\nabove four years. I immediately received my wages, and I never had\r\nearned seven guineas so quick in my life before; I had thirty-seven\r\nguineas in all, when I got cleared of the ship. I now entered upon a\r\nscene, quite new to me, but full of hope. In this situation my first\r\nthoughts were to look out for some of my former friends, and amongst\r\nthe first of those were the Miss Guerins. As soon, therefore, as I had\r\nregaled myself I went in quest of those kind ladies, whom I was very\r\nimpatient to see; and with some difficulty and perseverance, I found\r\nthem at May\'s-hill, Greenwich. They were most agreeably surprised to\r\nsee me, and I quite overjoyed at meeting with them. I told them my\r\nhistory, at which they expressed great wonder, and freely acknowledged\r\nit did their cousin, Capt. Pascal, no honour. He then visited there\r\nfrequently; and I met him four or five days after in Greenwich park.\r\nWhen he saw me he appeared a good deal surprised, and asked me how I\r\ncame back? I answered, \'In a ship.\' To which he replied dryly, \'I\r\nsuppose you did not walk back to London on the water.\' As I saw, by\r\nhis manner, that he did not seem to be sorry for his behaviour to me,\r\nand that I had not much reason to expect any favour from him, I told\r\nhim that he had used me very ill, after I had been such a faithful\r\nservant to him for so many years; on which, without saying any more,\r\nhe turned about and went away. A few days after this I met Capt.\r\nPascal at Miss Guerin\'s house, and asked him for my prize-money. He\r\nsaid there was none due to me; for, if my prize money had been\r\n10,000 \xc2\xa3. he had a right to it all. I told him I was informed\r\notherwise; on which he bade me defiance; and, in a bantering tone,\r\ndesired me to commence a lawsuit against him for it: \'There are\r\nlawyers enough,\' said he,\'that will take the cause in hand, and you\r\nhad better try it.\' I told him then that I would try it, which enraged\r\nhim very much; however, out of regard to the ladies, I remained still,\r\nand never made any farther demand of my right. Some time afterwards\r\nthese friendly ladies asked me what I meant to do with myself, and how\r\nthey could assist me. I thanked them, and said, if they pleased, I\r\nwould be their servant; but if not, as I had thirty-seven guineas,\r\nwhich would support me for some time, I would be much obliged to them\r\nto recommend me to some person who would teach me a business whereby I\r\nmight earn my living. They answered me very politely, that they were\r\nsorry it did not suit them to take me as their servant, and asked me\r\nwhat business I should like to learn? I said, hair-dressing. They then\r\npromised to assist me in this; and soon after they recommended me to a\r\ngentleman whom I had known before, one Capt. O\'Hara, who treated me\r\nwith much kindness, and procured me a master, a hair-dresser, in\r\nCoventry-court, Haymarket, with whom he placed me. I was with this man\r\nfrom September till the February following. In that time we had a\r\nneighbour in the same court who taught the French horn. He used to\r\nblow it so well that I was charmed with it, and agreed with him to\r\nteach me to blow it. Accordingly he took me in hand, and began to\r\ninstruct me, and I soon learned all the three parts. I took great\r\ndelight in blowing on this instrument, the evenings being long; and\r\nbesides that I was fond of it, I did not like to be idle, and it\r\nfilled up my vacant hours innocently. At this time also I agreed with\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Gregory, who lived in the same court, where he kept an\r\nacademy and an evening-school, to improve me in arithmetic. This he\r\ndid as far as barter and alligation; so that all the time I was there\r\nI was entirely employed. In February 1768 I hired myself to Dr.\r\nCharles Irving, in Pall-mall, so celebrated for his successful\r\nexperiments in making sea water fresh; and here I had plenty of\r\nhair-dressing to improve my hand. This gentleman was an excellent\r\nmaster; he was exceedingly kind and good tempered; and allowed me in\r\nthe evenings to attend my schools, which I esteemed a great blessing;\r\ntherefore I thanked God and him for it, and used all my diligence to\r\nimprove the opportunity. This diligence and attention recommended me\r\nto the notice and care of my three preceptors, who on their parts\r\nbestowed a great deal of pains in my instruction, and besides were all\r\nvery kind to me. My wages, however, which were by two thirds less than\r\nI ever had in my life (for I had only 12l. per annum) I soon found\r\nwould not be sufficient to defray this extraordinary expense of\r\nmasters, and my own necessary expenses; my old thirty-seven guineas\r\nhad by this time worn all away to one. I thought it best, therefore,\r\nto try the sea again in quest of more money, as I had been bred to it,\r\nand had hitherto found the profession of it successful. I had also a\r\nvery great desire to see Turkey, and I now determined to gratify it.\r\nAccordingly, in the month of May, 1768, I told the doctor my wish to\r\ngo to sea again, to which he made no opposition; and we parted on\r\nfriendly terms. The same day I went into the city in quest of a\r\nmaster. I was extremely fortunate in my inquiry; for I soon heard of a\r\ngentleman who had a ship going to Italy and Turkey, and he wanted a\r\nman who could dress hair well. I was overjoyed at this, and went\r\nimmediately on board of his ship, as I had been directed, which I\r\nfound to be fitted up with great taste, and I already foreboded no\r\nsmall pleasure in sailing in her. Not finding the gentleman on board,\r\nI was directed to his lodgings, where I met with him the next day, and\r\ngave him a specimen of my dressing. He liked it so well that he hired\r\nme immediately, so that I was perfectly happy; for the ship, master,\r\nand voyage, were entirely to my mind. The ship was called the Delawar,\r\nand my master\'s name was John Jolly, a neat smart good humoured man,\r\njust such an one as I wished to serve. We sailed from England in July\r\nfollowing, and our voyage was extremely pleasant. We went to Villa\r\nFranca, Nice, and Leghorn; and in all these places I was charmed with\r\nthe richness and beauty of the countries, and struck with the elegant\r\nbuildings with which they abound. We had always in them plenty of\r\nextraordinary good wines and rich fruits, which I was very fond of;\r\nand I had frequent occasions of gratifying both my taste and\r\ncuriosity; for my captain always lodged on shore in those places,\r\nwhich afforded me opportunities to see the country around. I also\r\nlearned navigation of the mate, which I was very fond of. When we left\r\nItaly we had delightful sailing among the Archipelago islands, and\r\nfrom thence to Smyrna in Turkey. This is a very ancient city; the\r\nhouses are built of stone, and most of them have graves adjoining to\r\nthem; so that they sometimes present the appearance of church-yards.\r\nProvisions are very plentiful in this city, and good wine less than a\r\npenny a pint. The grapes, pomegranates, and many other fruits, were\r\nalso the richest and largest I ever tasted. The natives are well\r\nlooking and strong made, and treated me always with great civility. In\r\ngeneral I believe they are fond of black people; and several of them\r\ngave me pressing invitations to stay amongst them, although they keep\r\nthe franks, or Christians, separate, and do not suffer them to dwell\r\nimmediately amongst them. I was astonished in not seeing women in any\r\nof their shops, and very rarely any in the streets; and whenever I did\r\nthey were covered with a veil from head to foot, so that I could not\r\nsee their faces, except when any of them out of curiosity uncovered\r\nthem to look at me, which they sometimes did. I was surprised to see\r\nhow the Greeks are, in some measure, kept under by the Turks, as the\r\nnegroes are in the West Indies by the white people. The less refined\r\nGreeks, as I have already hinted, dance here in the same manner as we\r\ndo in my nation. On the whole, during our stay here, which was about\r\nfive months, I liked the place and the Turks extremely well. I could\r\nnot help observing one very remarkable circumstance there: the tails\r\nof the sheep are flat, and so very large, that I have known the tail\r\neven of a lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen pounds. The fat of\r\nthem is very white and rich, and is excellent in puddings, for which\r\nit is much used. Our ship being at length richly loaded with silk, and\r\nother articles, we sailed for England.\r\n\r\nIn May 1769, soon after our return from Turkey, our ship made a\r\ndelightful voyage to Oporto in Portugal, where we arrived at the time\r\nof the carnival. On our arrival, there were sent on board to us\r\nthirty-six articles to observe, with very heavy penalties if we should\r\nbreak any of them; and none of us even dared to go on board any other\r\nvessel or on shore till the Inquisition had sent on board and\r\nsearched for every thing illegal, especially bibles. Such as were\r\nproduced, and certain other things, were sent on shore till the ships\r\nwere going away; and any person in whose custody a bible was found\r\nconcealed was to be imprisoned and flogged, and sent into slavery for\r\nten years. I saw here many very magnificent sights, particularly the\r\ngarden of Eden, where many of the clergy and laity went in procession\r\nin their several orders with the host, and sung Te Deum. I had a great\r\ncuriosity to go into some of their churches, but could not gain\r\nadmittance without using the necessary sprinkling of holy water at my\r\nentrance. From curiosity, and a wish to be holy, I therefore complied\r\nwith this ceremony, but its virtues were lost on me, for I found\r\nmyself nothing the better for it. This place abounds with plenty of\r\nall kinds of provisions. The town is well built and pretty, and\r\ncommands a fine prospect. Our ship having taken in a load of wine, and\r\nother commodities, we sailed for London, and arrived in July\r\nfollowing. Our next voyage was to the Mediterranean. The ship was\r\nagain got ready, and we sailed in September for Genoa. This is one of\r\nthe finest cities I ever saw; some of the edifices were of beautiful\r\nmarble, and made a most noble appearance; and many had very curious\r\nfountains before them. The churches were rich and magnificent, and\r\ncuriously adorned both in the inside and out. But all this grandeur\r\nwas in my eyes disgraced by the galley slaves, whose condition both\r\nthere and in other parts of Italy is truly piteous and wretched. After\r\nwe had stayed there some weeks, during which we bought many different\r\nthings which we wanted, and got them very cheap, we sailed to Naples,\r\na charming city, and remarkably clean. The bay is the most beautiful I\r\never saw; the moles for shipping are excellent. I thought it\r\nextraordinary to see grand operas acted here on Sunday nights, and\r\neven attended by their majesties. I too, like these great ones, went\r\nto those sights, and vainly served God in the day while I thus served\r\nmammon effectually at night. While we remained here there happened an\r\neruption of mount Vesuvius, of which I had a perfect view. It was\r\nextremely awful; and we were so near that the ashes from it used to be\r\nthick on our deck. After we had transacted our business at Naples we\r\nsailed with a fair wind once more for Smyrna, where we arrived in\r\nDecember. A seraskier or officer took a liking to me here, and wanted\r\nme to stay, and offered me two wives; however I refused the\r\ntemptation. The merchants here travel in caravans or large companies.\r\nI have seen many caravans from India, with some hundreds of camels,\r\nladen with different goods. The people of these caravans are quite\r\nbrown. Among other articles, they brought with them a great quantity\r\nof locusts, which are a kind of pulse, sweet and pleasant to the\r\npalate, and in shape resembling French beans, but longer. Each kind of\r\ngoods is sold in a street by itself, and I always found the Turks very\r\nhonest in their dealings. They let no Christians into their mosques or\r\nchurches, for which I was very sorry; as I was always fond of going to\r\nsee the different modes of worship of the people wherever I went. The\r\nplague broke out while we were in Smyrna, and we stopped taking goods\r\ninto the ship till it was over. She was then richly laden, and we\r\nsailed in about March 1770 for England. One day in our passage we met\r\nwith an accident which was near burning the ship. A black cook, in\r\nmelting some fat, overset the pan into the fire under the deck, which\r\nimmediately began to blaze, and the flame went up very high under the\r\nforetop. With the fright the poor cook became almost white, and\r\naltogether speechless. Happily however we got the fire out without\r\ndoing much mischief. After various delays in this passage, which was\r\ntedious, we arrived in Standgate creek in July; and, at the latter end\r\nof the year, some new event occurred, so that my noble captain, the\r\nship, and I all separated.\r\n\r\nIn April 1771 I shipped myself as a steward with Capt. Wm. Robertson\r\nof the ship Grenada Planter, once more to try my fortune in the West\r\nIndies; and we sailed from London for Madeira, Barbadoes, and the\r\nGrenades. When we were at this last place, having some goods to sell,\r\nI met once more with my former kind of West India customers. A white\r\nman, an islander, bought some goods of me to the amount of some\r\npounds, and made me many fair promises as usual, but without any\r\nintention of paying me. He had likewise bought goods from some more of\r\nour people, whom he intended to serve in the same manner; but he still\r\namused us with promises. However, when our ship was loaded, and near\r\nsailing, this honest buyer discovered no intention or sign of paying\r\nfor any thing he had bought of us; but on the contrary, when I asked\r\nhim for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought\r\ngoods of, so that we found we were like to get more blows than\r\npayment. On this we went to complain to one Mr. M\'Intosh, a justice of\r\nthe peace; we told his worship of the man\'s villainous tricks, and\r\nbegged that he would be kind enough to see us redressed: but being\r\nnegroes, although free, we could not get any remedy; and our ship\r\nbeing then just upon the point of sailing, we knew not how to help\r\nourselves, though we thought it hard to lose our property in this\r\nmanner. Luckily for us however, this man was also indebted to three\r\nwhite sailors, who could not get a farthing from him; they therefore\r\nreadily joined us, and we all went together in search of him. When we\r\nfound where he was, I took him out of a house and threatened him with\r\nvengeance; on which, finding he was likely to be handled roughly, the\r\nrogue offered each of us some small allowance, but nothing near our\r\ndemands. This exasperated us much more; and some were for cutting his\r\nears off; but he begged hard for mercy, which was at last granted him,\r\nafter we had entirely stripped him. We then let him go, for which he\r\nthanked us, glad to get off so easily, and ran into the bushes, after\r\nhaving wished us a good voyage. We then repaired on board, and shortly\r\nafter set sail for England. I cannot help remarking here a very narrow\r\nescape we had from being blown up, owing to a piece of negligence of\r\nmine. Just as our ship was under sail, I went down into the cabin to\r\ndo some business, and had a lighted candle in my hand, which, in my\r\nhurry, without thinking, I held in a barrel of gunpowder. It remained\r\nin the powder until it was near catching fire, when fortunately I\r\nobserved it and snatched it out in time, and providentially no harm\r\nhappened; but I was so overcome with terror that I immediately fainted\r\nat this deliverance.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-eight days time we arrived in England, and I got clear of\r\nthis ship. But, being still of a roving disposition, and desirous of\r\nseeing as many different parts of the world as I could, I shipped\r\nmyself soon after, in the same year, as steward on board of a fine\r\nlarge ship, called the Jamaica, Captain David Watt; and we sailed from\r\nEngland in December 1771 for Nevis and Jamaica. I found Jamaica to be\r\na very fine large island, well peopled, and the most considerable of\r\nthe West India islands. There was a vast number of negroes here, whom\r\nI found as usual exceedingly imposed upon by the white people, and the\r\nslaves punished as in the other islands. There are negroes whose\r\nbusiness it is to flog slaves; they go about to different people for\r\nemployment, and the usual pay is from one to four bits. I saw many\r\ncruel punishments inflicted on the slaves in the short time I stayed\r\nhere. In particular I was present when a poor fellow was tied up and\r\nkept hanging by the wrists at some distance from the ground, and then\r\nsome half hundred weights were fixed to his ancles, in which posture\r\nhe was flogged most unmercifully. There were also, as I heard, two\r\ndifferent masters noted for cruelty on the island, who had staked up\r\ntwo negroes naked, and in two hours the vermin stung them to death. I\r\nheard a gentleman I well knew tell my captain that he passed sentence\r\non a negro man to be burnt alive for attempting to poison an overseer.\r\nI pass over numerous other instances, in order to relieve the reader\r\nby a milder scene of roguery. Before I had been long on the island,\r\none Mr. Smith at Port Morant bought goods of me to the amount of\r\ntwenty-five pounds sterling; but when I demanded payment from him, he\r\nwas going each time to beat me, and threatened that he would put me in\r\ngoal. One time he would say I was going to set his house on fire, at\r\nanother he would swear I was going to run away with his slaves. I was\r\nastonished at this usage from a person who was in the situation of a\r\ngentleman, but I had no alternative; I was therefore obliged to\r\nsubmit. When I came to Kingston, I was surprised to see the number of\r\nAfricans who were assembled together on Sundays; particularly at a\r\nlarge commodious place, called Spring Path. Here each different nation\r\nof Africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country. They\r\nstill retain most of their native customs: they bury their dead, and\r\nput victuals, pipes and tobacco, and other things, in the grave with\r\nthe corps, in the same manner as in Africa. Our ship having got her\r\nloading we sailed for London, where we arrived in the August\r\nfollowing. On my return to London, I waited on my old and good master,\r\nDr. Irving, who made me an offer of his service again. Being now tired\r\nof the sea I gladly accepted it. I was very happy in living with this\r\ngentleman once more; during which time we were daily employed in\r\nreducing old Neptune\'s dominions by purifying the briny element and\r\nmaking it fresh. Thus I went on till May 1773, when I was roused by\r\nthe sound of fame, to seek new adventures, and to find, towards the\r\nnorth pole, what our Creator never intended we should, a passage to\r\nIndia. An expedition was now fitting out to explore a north-east\r\npassage, conducted by the Honourable John Constantine Phipps, since\r\nLord Mulgrave, in his Majesty\'s sloop of war the Race Horse. My master\r\nbeing anxious for the reputation of this adventure, we therefore\r\nprepared every thing for our voyage, and I attended him on board the\r\nRace Horse, the 24th day of May 1773. We proceeded to Sheerness, where\r\nwe were joined by his Majesty\'s sloop the Carcass, commanded by\r\nCaptain Lutwidge. On the 4th of June we sailed towards our destined\r\nplace, the pole; and on the 15th of the same month we were off\r\nShetland. On this day I had a great and unexpected deliverance from an\r\naccident which was near blowing up the ship and destroying the crew,\r\nwhich made me ever after during the voyage uncommonly cautious. The\r\nship was so filled that there was very little room on board for any\r\none, which placed me in a very aukward situation. I had resolved to\r\nkeep a journal of this singular and interesting voyage; and I had no\r\nother place for this purpose but a little cabin, or the doctor\'s\r\nstore-room, where I slept. This little place was stuffed with all\r\nmanner of combustibles, particularly with tow and aquafortis, and many\r\nother dangerous things. Unfortunately it happened in the evening as I\r\nwas writing my journal, that I had occasion to take the candle out of\r\nthe lanthorn, and a spark having touched a single thread of the tow,\r\nall the rest caught the flame, and immediately the whole was in a\r\nblaze. I saw nothing but present death before me, and expected to be\r\nthe first to perish in the flames. In a moment the alarm was spread,\r\nand many people who were near ran to assist in putting out the fire.\r\nAll this time I was in the very midst of the flames; my shirt, and the\r\nhandkerchief on my neck, were burnt, and I was almost smothered with\r\nthe smoke. However, through God\'s mercy, as I was nearly giving up all\r\nhopes, some people brought blankets and mattresses and threw them on\r\nthe flames, by which means in a short time the fire was put out. I was\r\nseverely reprimanded and menaced by such of the officers who knew it,\r\nand strictly charged never more to go there with a light: and, indeed,\r\neven my own fears made me give heed to this command for a little time;\r\nbut at last, not being able to write my journal in any other part of\r\nthe ship, I was tempted again to venture by stealth with a light in\r\nthe same cabin, though not without considerable fear and dread on my\r\nmind. On the 20th of June we began to use Dr. Irving\'s apparatus for\r\nmaking salt water fresh; I used to attend the distillery: I frequently\r\npurified from twenty-six to forty gallons a day. The water thus\r\ndistilled was perfectly pure, well tasted, and free from salt; and was\r\nused on various occasions on board the ship. On the 28th of June,\r\nbeing in lat. 78, we made Greenland, where I was surprised to see the\r\nsun did not set. The weather now became extremely cold; and as we\r\nsailed between north and east, which was our course, we saw many very\r\nhigh and curious mountains of ice; and also a great number of very\r\nlarge whales, which used to come close to our ship, and blow the water\r\nup to a very great height in the air. One morning we had vast\r\nquantities of sea-horses about the ship, which neighed exactly like\r\nany other horses. We fired some harpoon guns amongst them, in order to\r\ntake some, but we could not get any. The 30th, the captain of a\r\nGreenland ship came on board, and told us of three ships that were\r\nlost in the ice; however we still held on our course till July the\r\n11th, when we were stopt by one compact impenetrable body of ice. We\r\nran along it from east to west above ten degrees; and on the 27th we\r\ngot as far north as 80, 37; and in 19 or 20 degrees east longitude\r\nfrom London. On the 29th and 30th of July we saw one continued plain\r\nof smooth unbroken ice, bounded only by the horizon; and we fastened\r\nto a piece of ice that was eight yards eleven inches thick. We had\r\ngenerally sunshine, and constant daylight; which gave cheerfulness and\r\nnovelty to the whole of this striking, grand, and uncommon scene; and,\r\nto heighten it still more, the reflection of the sun from the ice gave\r\nthe clouds a most beautiful appearance. We killed many different\r\nanimals at this time, and among the rest nine bears. Though they had\r\nnothing in their paunches but water yet they were all very fat. We\r\nused to decoy them to the ship sometimes by burning feathers or skins.\r\nI thought them coarse eating, but some of the ship\'s company relished\r\nthem very much. Some of our people once, in the boat, fired at and\r\nwounded a sea-horse, which dived immediately; and, in a little time\r\nafter, brought up with it a number of others. They all joined in an\r\nattack upon the boat, and were with difficulty prevented from staving\r\nor oversetting her; but a boat from the Carcass having come to assist\r\nours, and joined it, they dispersed, after having wrested an oar from\r\none of the men. One of the ship\'s boats had before been attacked in\r\nthe same manner, but happily no harm was done. Though we wounded\r\nseveral of these animals we never got but one. We remained hereabouts\r\nuntil the 1st of August; when the two ships got completely fastened in\r\nthe ice, occasioned by the loose ice that set in from the sea. This\r\nmade our situation very dreadful and alarming; so that on the 7th day\r\nwe were in very great apprehension of having the ships squeezed to\r\npieces. The officers now held a council to know what was best for us\r\nto do in order to save our lives; and it was determined that we should\r\nendeavour to escape by dragging our boats along the ice towards the\r\nsea; which, however, was farther off than any of us thought. This\r\ndetermination filled us with extreme dejection, and confounded us with\r\ndespair; for we had very little prospect of escaping with life.\r\nHowever, we sawed some of the ice about the ships to keep it from\r\nhurting them; and thus kept them in a kind of pond. We then began to\r\ndrag the boats as well as we could towards the sea; but, after two or\r\nthree days labour, we made very little progress; so that some of our\r\nhearts totally failed us, and I really began to give up myself for\r\nlost, when I saw our surrounding calamities. While we were at this\r\nhard labour I once fell into a pond we had made amongst some loose\r\nice, and was very near being drowned; but providentially some people\r\nwere near who gave me immediate assistance, and thereby I escaped\r\ndrowning. Our deplorable condition, which kept up the constant\r\napprehension of our perishing in the ice, brought me gradually to\r\nthink of eternity in such a manner as I never had done before. I had\r\nthe fears of death hourly upon me, and shuddered at the thoughts of\r\nmeeting the grim king of terrors in the _natural_ state I then was in,\r\nand was exceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity if I should die in\r\nit. I had no hopes of my life being prolonged for any time; for we\r\nsaw that our existence could not be long on the ice after leaving the\r\nships, which were now out of sight, and some miles from the boats. Our\r\nappearance now became truly lamentable; pale dejection seized every\r\ncountenance; many, who had been before blasphemers, in this our\r\ndistress began to call on the good God of heaven for his help; and in\r\nthe time of our utter need he heard us, and against hope or human\r\nprobability delivered us! It was the eleventh day of the ships being\r\nthus fastened, and the fourth of our drawing the boats in this manner,\r\nthat the wind changed to the E.N.E. The weather immediately became\r\nmild, and the ice broke towards the sea, which was to the S.W. of us.\r\nMany of us on this got on board again, and with all our might we hove\r\nthe ships into every open water we could find, and made all the sail\r\non them in our power; and now, having a prospect of success, we made\r\nsignals for the boats and the remainder of the people. This seemed to\r\nus like a reprieve from death; and happy was the man who could first\r\nget on board of any ship, or the first boat he could meet. We then\r\nproceeded in this manner till we got into the open water again, which\r\nwe accomplished in about thirty hours, to our infinite joy and\r\ngladness of heart. As soon as we were out of danger we came to anchor\r\nand refitted; and on the 19th of August we sailed from this\r\nuninhabited extremity of the world, where the inhospitable climate\r\naffords neither food nor shelter, and not a tree or shrub of any kind\r\ngrows amongst its barren rocks; but all is one desolate and expanded\r\nwaste of ice, which even the constant beams of the sun for six months\r\nin the year cannot penetrate or dissolve. The sun now being on the\r\ndecline the days shortened as we sailed to the southward; and, on the\r\n28th, in latitude 73, it was dark by ten o\'clock at night. September\r\nthe 10th, in latitude 58-59, we met a very severe gale of wind and\r\nhigh seas, and shipped a great deal of water in the space of ten\r\nhours. This made us work exceedingly hard at all our pumps a whole\r\nday; and one sea, which struck the ship with more force than any thing\r\nI ever met with of the kind before, laid her under water for some\r\ntime, so that we thought she would have gone down. Two boats were\r\nwashed from the booms, and the long-boat from the chucks: all other\r\nmoveable things on the deck were also washed away, among which were\r\nmany curious things of different kinds which we had brought from\r\nGreenland; and we were obliged, in order to lighten the ship, to toss\r\nsome of our guns overboard. We saw a ship, at the same time, in very\r\ngreat distress, and her masts were gone; but we were unable to assist\r\nher. We now lost sight of the Carcass till the 26th, when we saw land\r\nabout Orfordness, off which place she joined us. From thence we sailed\r\nfor London, and on the 30th came up to Deptford. And thus ended our\r\nArctic voyage, to the no small joy of all on board, after having been\r\nabsent four months; in which time, at the imminent hazard of our\r\nlives, we explored nearly as far towards the Pole as 81 degrees north,\r\nand 20 degrees east longitude; being much farther, by all accounts,\r\nthan any navigator had ever ventured before; in which we fully proved\r\nthe impracticability of finding a passage that way to India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n     _The author leaves Doctor Irving and engages on board a\r\n     Turkey ship--Account of a black man\'s being kidnapped on\r\n     board and sent to the West Indies, and the author\'s\r\n     fruitless endeavours to procure his freedom--Some account of\r\n     the manner of the author\'s conversion to the faith of Jesus\r\n     Christ._\r\n\r\n\r\nOur voyage to the North Pole being ended, I returned to London with\r\nDoctor Irving, with whom I continued for some time, during which I\r\nbegan seriously to reflect on the dangers I had escaped, particularly\r\nthose of my last voyage, which made a lasting impression on my mind,\r\nand, by the grace of God, proved afterwards a mercy to me; it caused\r\nme to reflect deeply on my eternal state, and to seek the Lord with\r\nfull purpose of heart ere it was too late. I rejoiced greatly; and\r\nheartily thanked the Lord for directing me to London, where I was\r\ndetermined to work out my own salvation, and in so doing procure a\r\ntitle to heaven, being the result of a mind blended by ignorance and\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nIn process of time I left my master, Doctor Irving, the purifier of\r\nwaters, and lodged in Coventry-court, Haymarket, where I was\r\ncontinually oppressed and much concerned about the salvation of my\r\nsoul, and was determined (in my own strength) to be a first-rate\r\nChristian. I used every means for this purpose; and, not being able to\r\nfind any person amongst my acquaintance that agreed with me in point\r\nof religion, or, in scripture language, \'that would shew me any good;\'\r\nI was much dejected, and knew not where to seek relief; however, I\r\nfirst frequented the neighbouring churches, St. James\'s, and others,\r\ntwo or three times a day, for many weeks: still I came away\r\ndissatisfied; something was wanting that I could not obtain, and I\r\nreally found more heartfelt relief in reading my bible at home than in\r\nattending the church; and, being resolved to be saved, I pursued other\r\nmethods still. First I went among the quakers, where the word of God\r\nwas neither read or preached, so that I remained as much in the dark\r\nas ever. I then searched into the Roman catholic principles, but was\r\nnot in the least satisfied. At length I had recourse to the Jews,\r\nwhich availed me nothing, for the fear of eternity daily harassed my\r\nmind, and I knew not where to seek shelter from the wrath to come.\r\nHowever this was my conclusion, at all events, to read the four\r\nevangelists, and whatever sect or party I found adhering thereto such\r\nI would join. Thus I went on heavily without any guide to direct me\r\nthe way that leadeth to eternal life. I asked different people\r\nquestions about the manner of going to heaven, and was told different\r\nways. Here I was much staggered, and could not find any at that time\r\nmore righteous than myself, or indeed so much inclined to devotion. I\r\nthought we should not all be saved (this is agreeable to the holy\r\nscriptures), nor would all be damned. I found none among the circle of\r\nmy acquaintance that kept wholly the ten commandments. So righteous\r\nwas I in my own eyes, that I was convinced I excelled many of them in\r\nthat point, by keeping eight out of ten; and finding those who in\r\ngeneral termed themselves Christians not so honest or so good in their\r\nmorals as the Turks, I really thought the Turks were in a safer way of\r\nsalvation than my neighbours: so that between hopes and fears I went\r\non, and the chief comforts I enjoyed were in the musical French horn,\r\nwhich I then practised, and also dressing of hair. Such was my\r\nsituation some months, experiencing the dishonesty of many people\r\nhere. I determined at last to set out for Turkey, and there to end my\r\ndays. It was now early in the spring 1774. I sought for a master, and\r\nfound a captain John Hughes, commander of a ship called Anglicania,\r\nfitting out in the river Thames, and bound to Smyrna in Turkey. I\r\nshipped myself with him as a steward; at the same time I recommended\r\nto him a very clever black man, John Annis, as a cook. This man was on\r\nboard the ship near two months doing his duty: he had formerly lived\r\nmany years with Mr. William Kirkpatrick, a gentleman of the island of\r\nSt. Kitts, from whom he parted by consent, though he afterwards tried\r\nmany schemes to inveigle the poor man. He had applied to many captains\r\nwho traded to St. Kitts to trepan him; and when all their attempts and\r\nschemes of kidnapping proved abortive, Mr. Kirkpatrick came to our\r\nship at Union Stairs on Easter Monday, April the fourth, with two\r\nwherry boats and six men, having learned that the man was on board;\r\nand tied, and forcibly took him away from the ship, in the presence\r\nof the crew and the chief mate, who had detained him after he had\r\nnotice to come away. I believe that this was a combined piece of\r\nbusiness: but, at any rate, it certainly reflected great disgrace on\r\nthe mate and captain also, who, although they had desired the\r\noppressed man to stay on board, yet he did not in the least assist to\r\nrecover him, or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five\r\npounds. I proved the only friend he had, who attempted to regain him\r\nhis liberty if possible, having known the want of liberty myself. I\r\nsent as soon as I could to Gravesend, and got knowledge of the ship in\r\nwhich he was; but unluckily she had sailed the first tide after he was\r\nput on board. My intention was then immediately to apprehend Mr.\r\nKirkpatrick, who was about setting off for Scotland; and, having\r\nobtained a _habeas corpus_ for him, and got a tipstaff to go with me\r\nto St. Paul\'s church-yard, where he lived, he, suspecting something of\r\nthis kind, set a watch to look out. My being known to them occasioned\r\nme to use the following deception: I whitened my face, that they might\r\nnot know me, and this had its desired effect. He did not go out of his\r\nhouse that night, and next morning I contrived a well plotted\r\nstratagem notwithstanding he had a gentleman in his house to personate\r\nhim. My direction to the tipstaff, who got admittance into the house,\r\nwas to conduct him to a judge, according to the writ. When he came\r\nthere, his plea was, that he had not the body in custody, on which he\r\nwas admitted to bail. I proceeded immediately to that philanthropist,\r\nGranville Sharp, Esq. who received me with the utmost kindness, and\r\ngave me every instruction that was needful on the occasion. I left him\r\nin full hope that I should gain the unhappy man his liberty, with the\r\nwarmest sense of gratitude towards Mr. Sharp for his kindness; but,\r\nalas! my attorney proved unfaithful; he took my money, lost me many\r\nmonths employ, and did not do the least good in the cause: and when\r\nthe poor man arrived at St. Kitts, he was, according to custom, staked\r\nto the ground with four pins through a cord, two on his wrists, and\r\ntwo on his ancles, was cut and flogged most unmercifully, and\r\nafterwards loaded cruelly with irons about his neck. I had two very\r\nmoving letters from him, while he was in this situation; and also was\r\ntold of it by some very respectable families now in London, who saw\r\nhim in St. Kitts, in the same state in which he remained till kind\r\ndeath released him out of the hands of his tyrants. During this\r\ndisagreeable business I was under strong convictions of sin, and\r\nthought that my state was worse than any man\'s; my mind was\r\nunaccountably disturbed; I often wished for death, though at the same\r\ntime convinced I was altogether unprepared for that awful summons.\r\nSuffering much by villains in the late cause, and being much concerned\r\nabout the state of my soul, these things (but particularly the latter)\r\nbrought me very low; so that I became a burden to myself, and viewed\r\nall things around me as emptiness and vanity, which could give no\r\nsatisfaction to a troubled conscience. I was again determined to go to\r\nTurkey, and resolved, at that time, never more to return to England. I\r\nengaged as steward on board a Turkeyman (the Wester Hall, Capt.\r\nLinna); but was prevented by means of my late captain, Mr. Hughes, and\r\nothers. All this appeared to be against me, and the only comfort I\r\nthen experienced was, in reading the holy scriptures, where I saw that\r\n\'there is no new thing under the sun,\' Eccles. i. 9; and what was\r\nappointed for me I must submit to. Thus I continued to travel in much\r\nheaviness, and frequently murmured against the Almighty, particularly\r\nin his providential dealings; and, awful to think! I began to\r\nblaspheme, and wished often to be any thing but a human being. In\r\nthese severe conflicts the Lord answered me by awful \'visions of the\r\nnight, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed,\'\r\nJob xxxiii. 15. He was pleased, in much mercy, to give me to see, and\r\nin some measure to understand, the great and awful scene of the\r\njudgment-day, that \'no unclean person, no unholy thing, can enter into\r\nthe kingdom of God,\' Eph. v. 5. I would then, if it had been possible,\r\nhave changed my nature with the meanest worm on the earth; and was\r\nready to say to the mountains and rocks \'fall on me,\' Rev. vi. 16; but\r\nall in vain. I then requested the divine Creator that he would grant\r\nme a small space of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities,\r\nwhich I felt were grievous. The Lord, in his manifold mercies, was\r\npleased to grant my request, and being yet in a state of time, the\r\nsense of God\'s mercies was so great on my mind when I awoke, that my\r\nstrength entirely failed me for many minutes, and I was exceedingly\r\nweak. This was the first spiritual mercy I ever was sensible of, and\r\nbeing on praying ground, as soon as I recovered a little strength, and\r\ngot out of bed and dressed myself, I invoked Heaven from my inmost\r\nsoul, and fervently begged that God would never again permit me to\r\nblaspheme his most holy name. The Lord, who is long-suffering, and\r\nfull of compassion to such poor rebels as we are, condescended to hear\r\nand answer. I felt that I was altogether unholy, and saw clearly what\r\na bad use I had made of the faculties I was endowed with; they were\r\ngiven me to glorify God with; I thought, therefore, I had better want\r\nthem here, and enter into life eternal, than abuse them and be cast\r\ninto hell fire. I prayed to be directed, if there were any holier than\r\nthose with whom I was acquainted, that the Lord would point them out\r\nto me. I appealed to the Searcher of hearts, whether I did not wish to\r\nlove him more, and serve him better. Notwithstanding all this, the\r\nreader may easily discern, if he is a believer, that I was still in\r\nnature\'s darkness. At length I hated the house in which I lodged,\r\nbecause God\'s most holy name was blasphemed in it; then I saw the word\r\nof God verified, viz. \'Before they call, I will answer; and while they\r\nare yet speaking, I will hear.\'\r\n\r\nI had a great desire to read the bible the whole day at home; but not\r\nhaving a convenient place for retirement, I left the house in the day,\r\nrather than stay amongst the wicked ones; and that day as I was\r\nwalking, it pleased God to direct me to a house where there was an old\r\nsea-faring man, who experienced much of the love of God shed abroad in\r\nhis heart. He began to discourse with me; and, as I desired to love\r\nthe Lord, his conversation rejoiced me greatly; and indeed I had never\r\nheard before the love of Christ to believers set forth in such a\r\nmanner, and in so clear a point of view. Here I had more questions to\r\nput to the man than his time would permit him to answer; and in that\r\nmemorable hour there came in a dissenting minister; he joined our\r\ndiscourse, and asked me some few questions; among others, where I\r\nheard the gospel preached. I knew not what he meant by hearing the\r\ngospel; I told him I had read the gospel: and he asked where I went to\r\nchurch, or whether I went at all or not. To which I replied, \'I\r\nattended St. James\'s, St. Martin\'s, and St. Ann\'s, Soho;\'--\'So,\' said\r\nhe, \'you are a churchman.\' I answered, I was. He then invited me to a\r\nlove-feast at his chapel that evening. I accepted the offer, and\r\nthanked him; and soon after he went away, I had some further discourse\r\nwith the old Christian, added to some profitable reading, which made\r\nme exceedingly happy. When I left him he reminded me of coming to the\r\nfeast; I assured him I would be there. Thus we parted, and I weighed\r\nover the heavenly conversation that had passed between these two men,\r\nwhich cheered my then heavy and drooping spirit more than any thing I\r\nhad met with for many months. However, I thought the time long in\r\ngoing to my supposed banquet. I also wished much for the company of\r\nthese friendly men; their company pleased me much; and I thought the\r\ngentlemen very kind, in asking me, a stranger, to a feast; but how\r\nsingular did it appear to me, to have it in a chapel! When the\r\nwished-for hour came I went, and happily the old man was there, who\r\nkindly seated me, as he belonged to the place. I was much astonished\r\nto see the place filled with people, and no signs of eating and\r\ndrinking. There were many ministers in the company. At last they began\r\nby giving out hymns, and between the singing the minister engaged in\r\nprayer; in short, I knew not what to make of this sight, having never\r\nseen any thing of the kind in my life before now. Some of the guests\r\nbegan to speak their experience, agreeable to what I read in the\r\nScriptures; much was said by every speaker of the providence of God,\r\nand his unspeakable mercies, to each of them. This I knew in a great\r\nmeasure, and could most heartily join them. But when they spoke of a\r\nfuture state, they seemed to be altogether certain of their calling\r\nand election of God; and that no one could ever separate them from the\r\nlove of Christ, or pluck them out of his hands. This filled me with\r\nutter consternation, intermingled with admiration. I was so amazed as\r\nnot to know what to think of the company; my heart was attracted and\r\nmy affections were enlarged. I wished to be as happy as them, and was\r\npersuaded in my mind that they were different from the world \'that\r\nlieth in wickedness,\' 1 John v. 19. Their language and singing, &c.\r\ndid well harmonize; I was entirely overcome, and wished to live and\r\ndie thus. Lastly, some persons in the place produced some neat baskets\r\nfull of buns, which they distributed about; and each person\r\ncommunicated with his neighbour, and sipped water out of different\r\nmugs, which they handed about to all who were present. This kind of\r\nChristian fellowship I had never seen, nor ever thought of seeing on\r\nearth; it fully reminded me of what I had read in the holy scriptures,\r\nof the primitive Christians, who loved each other and broke bread. In\r\npartaking of it, even from house to house, this entertainment (which\r\nlasted about four hours) ended in singing and prayer. It was the first\r\nsoul feast I ever was present at. This last twenty-four hours produced\r\nme things, spiritual and temporal, sleeping and waking, judgment and\r\nmercy, that I could not but admire the goodness of God, in directing\r\nthe blind, blasphemous sinner in the path that he knew not of, even\r\namong the just; and instead of judgment he has shewed mercy, and will\r\nhear and answer the prayers and supplications of every returning\r\nprodigal:\r\n\r\n    O! to grace how great a debtor\r\n    Daily I\'m constrain\'d to be!\r\n\r\nAfter this I was resolved to win Heaven if possible; and if I perished\r\nI thought it should be at the feet of Jesus, in praying to him for\r\nsalvation. After having been an eye-witness to some of the happiness\r\nwhich attended those who feared God, I knew not how, with any\r\npropriety, to return to my lodgings, where the name of God was\r\ncontinually profaned, at which I felt the greatest horror. I paused in\r\nmy mind for some time, not knowing what to do; whether to hire a bed\r\nelsewhere, or go home again. At last, fearing an evil report might\r\narise, I went home, with a farewell to card-playing and vain jesting,\r\n&c. I saw that time was very short, eternity long, and very near, and\r\nI viewed those persons alone blessed who were found ready at midnight\r\ncall, or when the Judge of all, both quick and dead, cometh.\r\n\r\nThe next day I took courage, and went to Holborn, to see my new and\r\nworthy acquaintance, the old man, Mr. C----; he, with his wife, a\r\ngracious woman, were at work at silk weaving; they seemed mutually\r\nhappy, and both quite glad to see me, and I more so to see them. I sat\r\ndown, and we conversed much about soul matters, &c. Their discourse\r\nwas amazingly delightful, edifying, and pleasant. I knew not at last\r\nhow to leave this agreeable pair, till time summoned me away. As I\r\nwas going they lent me a little book, entitled "The Conversion of an\r\nIndian." It was in questions and answers. The poor man came over the\r\nsea to London, to inquire after the Christian\'s God, who, (through\r\nrich mercy) he found, and had not his journey in vain. The above book\r\nwas of great use to me, and at that time was a means of strengthening\r\nmy faith; however, in parting, they both invited me to call on them\r\nwhen I pleased. This delighted me, and I took care to make all the\r\nimprovement from it I could; and so far I thanked God for such company\r\nand desires. I prayed that the many evils I felt within might be done\r\naway, and that I might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances.\r\nThis was quickly heard and answered, and I was soon connected with\r\nthose whom the scripture calls the excellent of the earth. I heard the\r\ngospel preached, and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid\r\nopen by the preachers, and the way of salvation by Christ alone was\r\nevidently set forth. Thus I went on happily for near two months; and I\r\nonce heard, during this period, a reverend gentleman speak of a man\r\nwho had departed this life in full assurance of his going to glory. I\r\nwas much astonished at the assertion; and did very deliberately\r\ninquire how he could get at this knowledge. I was answered fully,\r\nagreeable to what I read in the oracles of truth; and was told also,\r\nthat if I did not experience the new birth, and the pardon of my sins,\r\nthrough the blood of Christ, before I died, I could not enter the\r\nkingdom of heaven. I knew not what to think of this report, as I\r\nthought I kept eight commandments out of ten; then my worthy\r\ninterpreter told me I did not do it, nor could I; and he added, that\r\nno man ever did or could keep the commandments, without offending in\r\none point. I thought this sounded very strange, and puzzled me much\r\nfor many weeks; for I thought it a hard saying. I then asked my\r\nfriend, Mr. L----d, who was a clerk in a chapel, why the commandments\r\nof God were given, if we could not be saved by them? To which he\r\nreplied, \'The law is a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ,\' who alone\r\ncould and did keep the commandments, and fulfilled all their\r\nrequirements for his elect people, even those to whom he had given a\r\nliving faith, and the sins of those chosen vessels _were already_\r\natoned for and forgiven them whilst living; and if I did not\r\nexperience the same before my exit, the Lord would say at that great\r\nday to me \'Go ye cursed,\' &c. &c. for God would appear faithful in his\r\njudgments to the wicked, as he would be faithful in shewing mercy to\r\nthose who were ordained to it before the world was; therefore Christ\r\nJesus seemed to be all in all to that man\'s soul. I was much wounded\r\nat this discourse, and brought into such a dilemma as I never\r\nexpected. I asked him, if _he_ was to die that moment, whether he was\r\nsure to enter the kingdom of God? and added, \'Do you _know_ that your\r\nsins are forgiven you?\' He answered in the affirmative. Then\r\nconfusion, anger, and discontent seized me, and I staggered much at\r\nthis sort of doctrine; it brought me to a stand, not knowing which to\r\nbelieve, whether salvation by works or by faith only in Christ. I\r\nrequested him to tell me how I might know when my sins were forgiven\r\nme. He assured me he could not, and that none but God alone could do\r\nthis. I told him it was very mysterious; but he said it was really\r\nmatter of fact, and quoted many portions of scripture immediately to\r\nthe point, to which I could make no reply. He then desired me to pray\r\nto God to shew me these things. I answered, that I prayed to God every\r\nday. He said, \'I perceive you are a churchman.\' I answered I was. He\r\nthen entreated me to beg of God to shew me what I was, and the true\r\nstate of my soul. I thought the prayer very short and odd; so we\r\nparted for that time. I weighed all these things well over, and could\r\nnot help thinking how it was possible for a man to know that his sins\r\nwere forgiven him in this life. I wished that God would reveal this\r\nself same thing unto me. In a short time after this I went to\r\nWestminster chapel; the Rev. Mr. P---- preached, from Lam. iii. 39. It\r\nwas a wonderful sermon; he clearly shewed that a living man had no\r\ncause to complain for the punishment of his sins; he evidently\r\njustified the Lord in all his dealings with the sons of men; he also\r\nshewed the justice of God in the eternal punishment of the wicked and\r\nimpenitent. The discourse seemed to me like a two-edged sword cutting\r\nall ways; it afforded me much joy, intermingled with many fears, about\r\nmy soul; and when it was ended, he gave it out that he intended, the\r\nensuing week, to examine all those who meant to attend the Lord\'s\r\ntable. Now I thought much of my good works, and at the same time was\r\ndoubtful of my being a proper object to receive the sacrament; I was\r\nfull of meditation till the day of examining. However, I went to the\r\nchapel, and, though much distressed, I addressed the reverend\r\ngentleman, thinking, if I was not right, he would endeavour to\r\nconvince me of it. When I conversed with him, the first thing he asked\r\nme was, what I knew of Christ? I told him I believed in him, and had\r\nbeen baptized in his name. \'Then,\' said he, \'when were you brought to\r\nthe knowledge of God? and how were you convinced of sin?\' I knew not\r\nwhat he meant by these questions; I told him I kept eight commandments\r\nout of ten; but that I sometimes swore on board ship, and sometimes\r\nwhen on shore, and broke the sabbath. He then asked me if I could\r\nread? I answered, \'Yes.\'--\'Then,\' said he,\'do you not read in the\r\nbible, he that offends in one point is guilty of all?\' I said, \'Yes.\'\r\nThen he assured me, that one sin unatoned for was as sufficient to\r\ndamn a soul as one leak was to sink a ship. Here I was struck with\r\nawe; for the minister exhorted me much, and reminded me of the\r\nshortness of time, and the length of eternity, and that no\r\nunregenerate soul, or any thing unclean, could enter the kingdom of\r\nHeaven. He did not admit me as a communicant; but recommended me to\r\nread the scriptures, and hear the word preached, not to neglect\r\nfervent prayer to God, who has promised to hear the supplications of\r\nthose who seek him in godly sincerity; so I took my leave of him, with\r\nmany thanks, and resolved to follow his advice, so far as the Lord\r\nwould condescend to enable me. During this time I was out of employ,\r\nnor was I likely to get a situation suitable for me, which obliged me\r\nto go once more to sea. I engaged as steward of a ship called the\r\nHope, Capt. Richard Strange, bound from London to Cadiz in Spain. In a\r\nshort time after I was on board I heard the name of God much\r\nblasphemed, and I feared greatly, lest I should catch the horrible\r\ninfection. I thought if I sinned again, after having life and death\r\nset evidently before me, I should certainly go to hell. My mind was\r\nuncommonly chagrined, and I murmured much at God\'s providential\r\ndealings with me, and was discontented with the commandments, that I\r\ncould not be saved by what I had done; I hated all things, and wished\r\nI had never been born; confusion seized me, and I wished to be\r\nannihilated. One day I was standing on the very edge of the stern of\r\nthe ship, thinking to drown myself; but this scripture was instantly\r\nimpressed on my mind--\'that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in\r\nhim,\' 1 John iii. 15. Then I paused, and thought myself the unhappiest\r\nman living. Again I was convinced that the Lord was better to me than\r\nI deserved, and I was better off in the world than many. After this I\r\nbegan to fear death; I fretted, mourned, and prayed, till I became a\r\nburden to others, but more so to myself. At length I concluded to beg\r\nmy bread on shore rather than go again to sea amongst a people who\r\nfeared not God, and I entreated the captain three different times to\r\ndischarge me; he would not, but each time gave me greater and greater\r\nencouragement to continue with him, and all on board shewed me very\r\ngreat civility: notwithstanding all this I was unwilling to embark\r\nagain. At last some of my religious friends advised me, by saying it\r\nwas my lawful calling, consequently it was my duty to obey, and that\r\nGod was not confined to place, &c. &c. particularly Mr. G.S. the\r\ngovernor of Tothil-fields Bridewell, who pitied my case, and read the\r\neleventh chapter of the Hebrews to me, with exhortations. He prayed\r\nfor me, and I believed that he prevailed on my behalf, as my burden\r\nwas then greatly removed, and I found a heartfelt resignation to the\r\nwill of God. The good man gave me a pocket Bible and Allen\'s Alarm to\r\nthe unconverted. We parted, and the next day I went on board again. We\r\nsailed for Spain, and I found favour with the captain. It was the\r\nfourth of the month of September when we sailed from London; we had a\r\ndelightful voyage to Cadiz, where we arrived the twenty-third of the\r\nsame month. The place is strong, commands a fine prospect, and is very\r\nrich. The Spanish galloons frequent that port, and some arrived whilst\r\nwe were there. I had many opportunities of reading the scriptures. I\r\nwrestled hard with God in fervent prayer, who had declared in his word\r\nthat he would hear the groanings and deep sighs of the poor in spirit.\r\nI found this verified to my utter astonishment and comfort in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th of October, (I pray you to attend) or all\r\nthat day, I thought that I should either see or hear something\r\nsupernatural. I had a secret impulse on my mind of something that was\r\nto take place, which drove me continually for that time to a throne of\r\ngrace. It pleased God to enable me to wrestle with him, as Jacob did:\r\nI prayed that if sudden death were to happen, and I perished, it might\r\nbe at Christ\'s feet.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day, as I was reading and meditating on the\r\nfourth chapter of the Acts, twelfth verse, under the solemn\r\napprehensions of eternity, and reflecting on my past actions, I began\r\nto think I had lived a moral life, and that I had a proper ground to\r\nbelieve I had an interest in the divine favour; but still meditating\r\non the subject, not knowing whether salvation was to be had partly for\r\nour own good deeds, or solely as the sovereign gift of God; in this\r\ndeep consternation the Lord was pleased to break in upon my soul with\r\nhis bright beams of heavenly light; and in an instant as it were,\r\nremoving the veil, and letting light into a dark place, I saw clearly\r\nwith the eye of faith the crucified Saviour bleeding on the cross on\r\nmount Calvary: the scriptures became an unsealed book, I saw myself a\r\ncondemned criminal under the law, which came with its full force to my\r\nconscience, and when \'the commandment came sin revived, and I died,\' I\r\nsaw the Lord Jesus Christ in his humiliation, loaded and bearing my\r\nreproach, sin, and shame. I then clearly perceived that by the deeds\r\nof the law no flesh living could be justified. I was then convinced\r\nthat by the first Adam sin came, and by the second Adam (the Lord\r\nJesus Christ) all that are saved must be made alive. It was given me\r\nat that time to know what it was to be born again, John iii. 5. I saw\r\nthe eighth chapter to the Romans, and the doctrines of God\'s decrees,\r\nverified agreeable to his eternal, everlasting, and unchangeable\r\npurposes. The word of God was sweet to my taste, yea sweeter than\r\nhoney and the honeycomb. Christ was revealed to my soul as the\r\nchiefest among ten thousand. These heavenly moments were really as\r\nlife to the dead, and what John calls an earnest of the Spirit[V].\r\nThis was indeed unspeakable, and I firmly believe undeniable by many.\r\nNow every leading providential circumstance that happened to me, from\r\nthe day I was taken from my parents to that hour, was then in my view,\r\nas if it had but just then occurred. I was sensible of the invisible\r\nhand of God, which guided and protected me when in truth I knew it\r\nnot: still the Lord pursued me although I slighted and disregarded it;\r\nthis mercy melted me down. When I considered my poor wretched state I\r\nwept, seeing what a great debtor I was to sovereign free grace. Now\r\nthe Ethiopian was willing to be saved by Jesus Christ, the sinner\'s\r\nonly surety, and also to rely on none other person or thing for\r\nsalvation. Self was obnoxious, and good works he had none, for it is\r\nGod that worketh in us both to will and to do. The amazing things of\r\nthat hour can never be told--it was joy in the Holy Ghost! I felt an\r\nastonishing change; the burden of sin, the gaping jaws of hell, and\r\nthe fears of death, that weighed me down before, now lost their\r\nhorror; indeed I thought death would now be the best earthly friend I\r\never had. Such were my grief and joy as I believe are seldom\r\nexperienced. I was bathed in tears, and said, What am I that God\r\nshould thus look on me the vilest of sinners? I felt a deep concern\r\nfor my mother and friends, which occasioned me to pray with fresh\r\nardour; and, in the abyss of thought, I viewed the unconverted people\r\nof the world in a very awful state, being without God and without\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nIt pleased God to pour out on me the Spirit of prayer and the grace of\r\nsupplication, so that in loud acclamations I was enabled to praise and\r\nglorify his most holy name. When I got out of the cabin, and told some\r\nof the people what the Lord had done for me, alas, who could\r\nunderstand me or believe my report!--None but to whom the arm of the\r\nLord was revealed. I became a barbarian to them in talking of the love\r\nof Christ: his name was to me as ointment poured forth; indeed it was\r\nsweet to my soul, but to them a rock of offence. I thought my case\r\nsingular, and every hour a day until I came to London, for I much\r\nlonged to be with some to whom I could tell of the wonders of God\'s\r\nlove towards me, and join in prayer to him whom my soul loved and\r\nthirsted after. I had uncommon commotions within, such as few can tell\r\naught about. Now the bible was my only companion and comfort; I prized\r\nit much, with many thanks to God that I could read it for myself, and\r\nwas not left to be tossed about or led by man\'s devices and notions.\r\nThe worth of a soul cannot be told.--May the Lord give the reader an\r\nunderstanding in this. Whenever I looked in the bible I saw things\r\nnew, and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort,\r\nfor I knew that to me was the word of salvation sent. Sure I was that\r\nthe Spirit which indited the word opened my heart to receive the truth\r\nof it as it is in Jesus--that the same Spirit enabled me to act faith\r\nupon the promises that were so precious to me, and enabled me to\r\nbelieve to the salvation of my soul. By free grace I was persuaded\r\nthat I had a part in the first resurrection, and was \'enlightened with\r\nthe light of the living,\' Job xxxiii. 30. I wished for a man of God\r\nwith whom I might converse: my soul was like the chariots of Aminidab,\r\nCanticles vi. 12. These, among others, were the precious promises that\r\nwere so powerfully applied to me: \'All things whatsoever ye shall ask\r\nin prayer, believing, ye shall receive,\' Mat. xxi. 22. \'Peace I leave\r\nwith you, my peace I give unto you,\' John xiv. 27. I saw the blessed\r\nRedeemer to be the fountain of life, and the well of salvation. I\r\nexperienced him all in all; he had brought me by a way that I knew\r\nnot, and he had made crooked paths straight. Then in his name I set up\r\nmy Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto he hath helped me: and could say to the\r\nsinners about me, Behold what a Saviour I have! Thus I was, by the\r\nteaching of that all-glorious Deity, the great One in Three, and Three\r\nin One, confirmed in the truths of the bible, those oracles of\r\neverlasting truth, on which every soul living must stand or fall\r\neternally, agreeable to Acts iv. 12. \'Neither is there salvation in\r\nany other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men\r\nwhereby we must be saved, but only Christ Jesus.\' May God give the\r\nreader a right understanding in these facts! To him that believeth all\r\nthings are possible, but to them that are unbelieving nothing is pure,\r\nTitus i. 15. During this period we remained at Cadiz until our ship\r\ngot laden. We sailed about the fourth of November; and, having a good\r\npassage, we arrived in London the month following, to my comfort, with\r\nheartfelt gratitude to God for his rich and unspeakable mercies. On my\r\nreturn I had but one text which puzzled me, or that the devil\r\nendeavoured to buffet me with, viz. Rom. xi. 6. and, as I had heard of\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Romaine, and his great knowledge in the scriptures, I\r\nwished much to hear him preach. One day I went to Blackfriars church,\r\nand, to my great satisfaction and surprise, he preached from that very\r\ntext. He very clearly shewed the difference between human works and\r\nfree election, which is according to God\'s sovereign will and\r\npleasure. These glad tidings set me entirely at liberty, and I went\r\nout of the church rejoicing, seeing my spots were those of God\'s\r\nchildren. I went to Westminster Chapel, and saw some of my old\r\nfriends, who were glad when they perceived the wonderful change that\r\nthe Lord had wrought in me, particularly Mr. G---- S----, my worthy\r\nacquaintance, who was a man of a choice spirit, and had great zeal for\r\nthe Lord\'s service. I enjoyed his correspondence till he died in the\r\nyear 1784. I was again examined at that same chapel, and was received\r\ninto church fellowship amongst them: I rejoiced in spirit, making\r\nmelody in my heart to the God of all my mercies.

not all that I could do\r\n    Would stop the current of my woe;\r\n    Conviction still my vileness shew\'d;\r\n    How great my guilt--how lost from God!\r\n\r\n    \'Prevented, that I could not die,\r\n    Nor might to one kind refuge fly;\r\n    An orphan state I had to mourn,--\r\n    Forsook by all, and left forlorn.\'\r\n\r\n    Those who beheld my downcast mien\r\n    Could not guess at my woes unseen:\r\n    They by appearance could not know\r\n    The troubles that I waded through.\r\n\r\n    \'Lust, anger, blasphemy, and pride,\r\n    With legions of such ills beside,\r\n    Troubled my thoughts,\' while doubts and fears\r\n    Clouded and darken\'d most my years.\r\n\r\n    \'Sighs now no more would be confin\'d--\r\n    They breath\'d the trouble of my mind:\r\n    I wish\'d for death, but check\'d the word,\r\n    And often pray\'d unto the Lord.\'\r\n\r\n    Unhappy, more than some on earth,\r\n    I thought the place that gave me birth--\r\n    Strange thoughts oppress\'d--while I replied\r\n    "Why not in Ethiopia died?"\r\n\r\n    And why thus spared, nigh to hell?--\r\n    God only knew--I could not tell!\r\n    \'A tott\'ring fence, a bowing wall\r\n    thought myself ere since the fall.\'\r\n\r\n    \'Oft times I mused, nigh despair,\r\n    While birds melodious fill\'d the air:\r\n    Thrice happy songsters, ever free,\r\n    How bless\'d were they compar\'d to me!\'\r\n\r\n    Thus all things added to my pain,\r\n    While grief compell\'d me to complain;\r\n    When sable clouds began to rise\r\n    My mind grew darker than the skies.\r\n\r\n    The English nation call\'d to leave,\r\n    How did my breast with sorrows heave!\r\n    I long\'d for rest--cried "Help me, Lord!\r\n    Some mitigation, Lord, afford!"\r\n\r\n    Yet on, dejected, still I went--\r\n    Heart-throbbing woes within were pent;\r\n    Nor land, nor sea, could comfort give,\r\n    Nothing my anxious mind relieve.\r\n\r\n    Weary with travail, yet unknown\r\n    To all but God and self alone,\r\n    Numerous months for peace I strove,\r\n    And numerous foes I had to prove.\r\n\r\n    Inur\'d to dangers, griefs, and woes,\r\n    Train\'d up \'midst perils, deaths, and foes,\r\n    I said "Must it thus ever be?--\r\n    No quiet is permitted me."\r\n\r\n    Hard hap, and more than heavy lot!\r\n    I pray\'d to God "Forget me not--\r\n    What thou ordain\'st willing I\'ll bear;\r\n    But O!

We had a\r\nvery good passage, without any material accident, until we arrived off\r\nthe Bay of Cadiz; when one Sunday, just as we were going into the\r\nharbour, the ship struck against a rock and knocked off a garboard\r\nplank, which is the next to the keel. In an instant all hands were in\r\nthe greatest confusion, and began with loud cries to call on God to\r\nhave mercy on them. Although I could not swim, and saw no way of\r\nescaping death, I felt no dread in my then situation, having no desire\r\nto live. I even rejoiced in spirit, thinking this death would be\r\nsudden glory. But the fulness of time was not yet come. The people\r\nnear to me were much astonished in seeing me thus calm and resigned;\r\nbut I told them of the peace of God, which through sovereign grace I\r\nenjoyed, and these words were that instant in my mind:\r\n\r\n    "Christ is my pilot wise, my compass is his word;\r\n    My soul each storm defies, while I have such a Lord.\r\n      I trust his faithfulness and power,\r\n      To save me in the trying hour.\r\n    Though rocks and quicksands deep through all my passage lie,\r\n    Yet Christ shall safely keep and guide me with his eye.\r\n      How can I sink with such a prop,\r\n      That bears the world and all things up?"\r\n\r\nAt this time there were many large Spanish flukers or passage-vessels\r\nfull of people crossing the channel; who seeing our condition, a\r\nnumber of them came alongside of us. As many hands as could be\r\nemployed began to work; some at our three pumps, and the rest\r\nunloading the ship as fast as possible. There being only a single rock\r\ncalled the Porpus on which we struck, we soon got off it, and\r\nprovidentially it was then high water, we therefore run the ship\r\nashore at the nearest place to keep her from sinking. After many\r\ntides, with a great deal of care and industry, we got her repaired\r\nagain. When we had dispatched our business at Cadiz, we went to\r\nGibraltar, and from thence to Malaga, a very pleasant and rich city,\r\nwhere there is one of the finest cathedrals I had ever seen. It had\r\nbeen above fifty years in building, as I heard, though it was not then\r\nquite finished; great part of the inside, however, was completed and\r\nhighly decorated with the richest marble columns and many superb\r\npaintings; it was lighted occasionally by an amazing number of wax\r\ntapers of different sizes, some of which were as thick as a man\'s\r\nthigh; these, however, were only used on some of their grand\r\nfestivals.\r\n\r\nI was very much shocked at the custom of bull-baiting, and other\r\ndiversions which prevailed here on Sunday evenings, to the great\r\nscandal of Christianity and morals. I used to express my abhorrence of\r\nit to a priest whom I met with. I had frequent contests about religion\r\nwith the reverend father, in which he took great pains to make a\r\nproselyte of me to his church; and I no less to convert him to mine.\r\nOn these occasions I used to produce my Bible, and shew him in what\r\npoints his church erred. He then said he had been in England, and that\r\nevery person there read the Bible, which was very wrong; but I\r\nanswered him that Christ desired us to search the Scriptures. In his\r\nzeal for my conversion, he solicited me to go to one of the\r\nuniversities in Spain, and declared that I should have my education\r\nfree; and told me, if I got myself made a priest, I might in time\r\nbecome even pope; and that Pope Benedict was a black man. As I was\r\never desirous of learning, I paused for some time upon this\r\ntemptation; and thought by being crafty I might catch some with guile;\r\nbut I began to think that it would be only hypocrisy in me to embrace\r\nhis offer, as I could not in conscience conform to the opinions of his\r\nchurch. I was therefore enabled to regard the word of God, which says,\r\n\'Come out from amongst them,\' and refused Father Vincent\'s offer. So\r\nwe parted without conviction on either side.\r\n\r\nHaving taken at this place some fine wines, fruits, and money, we\r\nproceeded to Cadiz, where we took about two tons more of money, &c.\r\nand then sailed for England in the month of June. When we were about\r\nthe north latitude 42, we had contrary wind for several days, and the\r\nship did not make in that time above six or seven miles straight\r\ncourse. This made the captain exceeding fretful and peevish: and I was\r\nvery sorry to hear God\'s most holy name often blasphemed by him. One\r\nday, as he was in that impious mood, a young gentleman on board, who\r\nwas a passenger, reproached him, and said he acted wrong; for we ought\r\nto be thankful to God for all things, as we were not in want of any\r\nthing on board; and though the wind was contrary for us, yet it was\r\nfair for some others, who, perhaps, stood in more need of it than we.\r\nI immediately seconded this young gentleman with some boldness, and\r\nsaid we had not the least cause to murmur, for that the Lord was\r\nbetter to us than we deserved, and that he had done all things well. I\r\nexpected that the captain would be very angry with me for speaking,\r\nbut he replied not a word. However, before that time on the following\r\nday, being the 21st of June, much to our great joy and astonishment,\r\nwe saw the providential hand of our benign Creator, whose ways with\r\nhis blind creatures are past finding out. The preceding night I\r\ndreamed that I saw a boat immediately off the starboard main shrouds;\r\nand exactly at half past one o\'clock, the following day at noon, while\r\nI was below, just as we had dined in the cabin, the man at the helm\r\ncried out, A boat! which brought my dream that instant into my mind. I\r\nwas the first man that jumped on the deck; and, looking from the\r\nshrouds onward, according to my dream, I descried a little boat at\r\nsome distance; but, as the waves were high, it was as much as we could\r\ndo sometimes to discern her; we however stopped the ship\'s way, and\r\nthe boat, which was extremely small, came alongside with eleven\r\nmiserable men, whom we took on board immediately. To all human\r\nappearance, these people must have perished in the course of one hour\r\nor less, the boat being small, it barely contained them. When we took\r\nthem up they were half drowned, and had no victuals, compass, water,\r\nor any other necessary whatsoever, and had only one bit of an oar to\r\nsteer with, and that right before the wind; so that they were obliged\r\nto trust entirely to the mercy of the waves. As soon as we got them\r\nall on board, they bowed themselves on their knees, and, with hands\r\nand voices lifted up to heaven, thanked God for their deliverance; and\r\nI trust that my prayers were not wanting amongst them at the same\r\ntime. This mercy of the Lord quite melted me, and I recollected his\r\nwords, which I saw thus verified in the 107th Psalm \'O give thanks\r\nunto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. Hungry\r\nand thirsty, their souls fainted in them. They cried unto Lord in\r\ntheir trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. And he\r\nled them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of\r\nhabitation. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for\r\nhis wonderful works to the children of men! For he satisfieth the\r\nlonging soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.\r\n\r\n\'Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death:\r\n\r\n\'Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out\r\nof their distresses. They that go down to the sea in ships; that do\r\nbusiness in great waters: these see the works of the Lord, and his\r\nwonders in the deep. Whoso is wise and will observe these things, even\r\nthey shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord.\'\r\n\r\nThe poor distressed captain said,\'that the Lord is good; for, seeing\r\nthat I am not fit to die, he therefore gave me a space of time to\r\nrepent.\' I was very glad to hear this expression, and took an\r\nopportunity when convenient of talking to him on the providence of\r\nGod. They told us they were Portuguese, and were in a brig loaded with\r\ncorn, which shifted that morning at five o\'clock, owing to which the\r\nvessel sunk that instant with two of the crew; and how these eleven\r\ngot into the boat (which was lashed to the deck) not one of them could\r\ntell. We provided them with every necessary, and brought them all safe\r\nto London: and I hope the Lord gave them repentance unto life eternal.\r\n\r\nI was happy once more amongst my friends and brethren, till November,\r\nwhen my old friend, the celebrated Doctor Irving, bought a remarkable\r\nfine sloop, about 150 tons. He had a mind for a new adventure in\r\ncultivating a plantation at Jamaica and the Musquito Shore; asked me\r\nto go with him, and said that he would trust me with his estate in\r\npreference to any one. By the advice, therefore, of my friends, I\r\naccepted of the offer, knowing that the harvest was fully ripe in\r\nthose parts, and hoped to be the instrument, under God, of bringing\r\nsome poor sinner to my well beloved master, Jesus Christ. Before I\r\nembarked, I found with the Doctor four Musquito Indians, who were\r\nchiefs in their own country, and were brought here by some English\r\ntraders for some selfish ends. One of them was the Musquito king\'s\r\nson; a youth of about eighteen years of age; and whilst he was here he\r\nwas baptized by the name of George. They were going back at the\r\ngovernment\'s expense, after having been in England about twelve\r\nmonths, during which they learned to speak pretty good English. When I\r\ncame to talk to them about eight days before we sailed, I was very\r\nmuch mortified in finding that they had not frequented any churches\r\nsince they were here, to be baptized, nor was any attention paid to\r\ntheir morals. I was very sorry for this mock Christianity, and had\r\njust an opportunity to take some of them once to church before we\r\nsailed. We embarked in the month of November 1775, on board of the\r\nsloop Morning Star, Captain David Miller, and sailed for Jamaica. In\r\nour passage, I took all the pains that I could to instruct the Indian\r\nprince in the doctrines of Christianity, of which he was entirely\r\nignorant; and, to my great joy, he was quite attentive, and received\r\nwith gladness the truths that the Lord enabled me to set forth to him.\r\nI taught him in the compass of eleven days all the letters, and he\r\ncould put even two or three of them together and spell them. I had\r\nFox\'s Martyrology with cuts, and he used to be very fond of looking\r\ninto it, and would ask many questions about the papal cruelties he saw\r\ndepicted there, which I explained to him. I made such progress with\r\nthis youth, especially in religion, that when I used to go to bed at\r\ndifferent hours of the night, if he was in his bed, he would get up on\r\npurpose to go to prayer with me, without any other clothes than his\r\nshirt; and before he would eat any of his meals amongst the gentlemen\r\nin the cabin, he would first come to me to pray, as he called it. I\r\nwas well pleased at this, and took great delight in him, and used much\r\nsupplication to God for his conversion. I was in full hope of seeing\r\ndaily every appearance of that change which I could wish; not knowing\r\nthe devices of satan, who had many of his emissaries to sow his tares\r\nas fast as I sowed the good seed, and pull down as fast as I built up.\r\nThus we went on nearly four fifths of our passage, when satan at last\r\ngot the upper hand. Some of his messengers, seeing this poor heathen\r\nmuch advanced in piety, began to ask him whether I had converted him\r\nto Christianity, laughed, and made their jest at him, for which I\r\nrebuked them as much as I could; but this treatment caused the prince\r\nto halt between two opinions. Some of the true sons of Belial, who did\r\nnot believe that there was any hereafter, told him never to fear the\r\ndevil, for there was none existing; and if ever he came to the prince,\r\nthey desired he might be sent to them. Thus they teazed the poor\r\ninnocent youth, so that he would not learn his book any more! He would\r\nnot drink nor carouse with these ungodly actors, nor would he be with\r\nme, even at prayers. This grieved me very much. I endeavoured to\r\npersuade him as well as I could, but he would not come; and entreated\r\nhim very much to tell me his reasons for acting thus. At last he asked\r\nme, \'How comes it that all the white men on board who can read and\r\nwrite, and observe the sun, and know all things, yet swear, lie, and\r\nget drunk, only excepting yourself?\' I answered him, the reason was,\r\nthat they did not fear God; and that if any one of them died so they\r\ncould not go to, or be happy with God. He replied, that if these\r\npersons went to hell he would go to hell too. I was sorry to hear\r\nthis; and, as he sometimes had the toothach, and also some other\r\npersons in the ship at the same time, I asked him if their toothach\r\nmade his easy: he said, No. Then I told him if he and these people\r\nwent to hell together, their pains would not make his any lighter.\r\nThis answer had great weight with him: it depressed his spirits much;\r\nand he became ever after, during the passage, fond of being alone.\r\nWhen we were in the latitude of Martinico, and near making the land,\r\none morning we had a brisk gale of wind, and, carrying too much sail,\r\nthe main-mast went over the side. Many people were then all about the\r\ndeck, and the yards, masts, and rigging, came tumbling all about us,\r\nyet there was not one of us in the least hurt, although some were\r\nwithin a hair\'s breadth of being killed: and, particularly, I saw two\r\nmen then, by the providential hand of God, most miraculously preserved\r\nfrom being smashed to pieces. On the fifth of January we made Antigua\r\nand Montserrat, and ran along the rest of the islands: and on the\r\nfourteenth we arrived at Jamaica. One Sunday while we were there I\r\ntook the Musquito Prince George to church, where he saw the sacrament\r\nadministered. When we came out we saw all kinds of people, almost from\r\nthe church door for the space of half a mile down to the waterside,\r\nbuying and selling all kinds of commodities: and these acts afforded\r\nme great matter of exhortation to this youth, who was much astonished.\r\nOur vessel being ready to sail for the Musquito shore, I went with the\r\nDoctor on board a Guinea-man, to purchase some slaves to carry with\r\nus, and cultivate a plantation; and I chose them all my own\r\ncountrymen. On the twelfth of February we sailed from Jamaica, and on\r\nthe eighteenth arrived at the Musquito shore, at a place called\r\nDupeupy. All our Indian guests now, after I had admonished them and a\r\nfew cases of liquor given them by the Doctor, took an affectionate\r\nleave of us, and went ashore, where they were met by the Musquito\r\nking, and we never saw one of them afterwards. We then sailed to the\r\nsouthward of the shore, to a place called Cape Gracias a Dios, where\r\nthere was a large lagoon or lake, which received the emptying of two\r\nor three very fine large rivers, and abounded much in fish and land\r\ntortoise. Some of the native Indians came on board of us here; and we\r\nused them well, and told them we were come to dwell amongst them,\r\nwhich they seemed pleased at. So the Doctor and I, with some others,\r\nwent with them ashore; and they took us to different places to view\r\nthe land, in order to choose a place to make a plantation of. We fixed\r\non a spot near a river\'s bank, in a rich soil; and, having got our\r\nnecessaries out of the sloop, we began to clear away the woods, and\r\nplant different kinds of vegetables, which had a quick growth. While\r\nwe were employed in this manner, our vessel went northward to Black\r\nRiver to trade. While she was there, a Spanish guarda costa met with\r\nand took her. This proved very hurtful, and a great embarrassment to\r\nus. However, we went on with the culture of the land. We used to make\r\nfires every night all around us, to keep off wild beasts, which, as\r\nsoon as it was dark, set up a most hideous roaring. Our habitation\r\nbeing far up in the woods, we frequently saw different kinds of\r\nanimals; but none of them ever hurt us, except poisonous snakes, the\r\nbite of which the Doctor used to cure by giving to the patient, as\r\nsoon as possible, about half a tumbler of strong rum, with a good deal\r\nof Cayenne pepper in it. In this manner he cured two natives and one\r\nof his own slaves. The Indians were exceedingly fond of the Doctor,\r\nand they had good reason for it; for I believe they never had such an\r\nuseful man amongst them. They came from all quarters to our dwelling;\r\nand some _woolwow_, or flat-headed Indians, who lived fifty or sixty\r\nmiles above our river, and this side of the South Sea, brought us a\r\ngood deal of silver in exchange for our goods. The principal articles\r\nwe could get from our neighbouring Indians, were turtle oil, and\r\nshells, little silk grass, and some provisions; but they would not\r\nwork at any thing for us, except fishing; and a few times they\r\nassisted to cut some trees down, in order to build us houses; which\r\nthey did exactly like the Africans, by the joint labour of men, women,\r\nand children. I do not recollect any of them to have had more than two\r\nwives. These always accompanied their husbands when they came to our\r\ndwelling; and then they generally carried whatever they brought to us,\r\nand always squatted down behind their husbands. Whenever we gave them\r\nany thing to eat, the men and their wives ate it separate. I never\r\nsaw the least sign of incontinence amongst them. The women are\r\nornamented with beads, and fond of painting themselves; the men also\r\npaint, even to excess, both their faces and shirts: their favourite\r\ncolour is red. The women generally cultivate the ground, and the men\r\nare all fishermen and canoe makers. Upon the whole, I never met any\r\nnation that were so simple in their manners as these people, or had so\r\nlittle ornament in their houses. Neither had they, as I ever could\r\nlearn, one word expressive of an oath. The worst word I ever heard\r\namongst them when they were quarreling, was one that they had got from\r\nthe English, which was, \'you rascal.\' I never saw any mode of worship\r\namong them; but in this they were not worse than their European\r\nbrethren or neighbours: for I am sorry to say that there was not one\r\nwhite person in our dwelling, nor any where else that I saw in\r\ndifferent places I was at on the shore, that was better or more pious\r\nthan those unenlightened Indians; but they either worked or slept on\r\nSundays: and, to my sorrow, working was too much Sunday\'s employment\r\nwith ourselves; so much so, that in some length of time we really did\r\nnot know one day from another. This mode of living laid the foundation\r\nof my decamping at last. The natives are well made and warlike; and\r\nthey particularly boast of having never been conquered by the\r\nSpaniards. They are great drinkers of strong liquors when they can get\r\nthem. We used to distil rum from pine apples, which were very\r\nplentiful here; and then we could not get them away from our place.\r\nYet they seemed to be singular, in point of honesty, above any other\r\nnation I was ever amongst. The country being hot, we lived under an\r\nopen shed, where we had all kinds of goods, without a door or a lock\r\nto any one article; yet we slept in safety, and never lost any thing,\r\nor were disturbed. This surprised us a good deal; and the Doctor,\r\nmyself, and others, used to say, if we were to lie in that manner in\r\nEurope we should have our throats cut the first night. The Indian\r\ngovernor goes once in a certain time all about the province or\r\ndistrict, and has a number of men with him as attendants and\r\nassistants. He settles all the differences among the people, like the\r\njudge here, and is treated with very great respect. He took care to\r\ngive us timely notice before he came to our habitation, by sending his\r\nstick as a token, for rum, sugar, and gunpowder, which we did not\r\nrefuse sending; and at the same time we made the utmost preparation to\r\nreceive his honour and his train. When he came with his tribe, and all\r\nour neighbouring chieftains, we expected to find him a grave reverend\r\njudge, solid and sagacious; but instead of that, before he and his\r\ngang came in sight, we heard them very clamorous; and they even had\r\nplundered some of our good neighbouring Indians, having intoxicated\r\nthemselves with our liquor. When they arrived we did not know what to\r\nmake of our new guests, and would gladly have dispensed with the\r\nhonour of their company. However, having no alternative, we feasted\r\nthem plentifully all the day till the evening; when the governor,\r\ngetting quite drunk, grew very unruly, and struck one of our most\r\nfriendly chiefs, who was our nearest neighbour, and also took his\r\ngold-laced hat from him. At this a great commotion taken place; and\r\nthe Doctor interfered to make peace, as we could all understand one\r\nanother, but to no purpose; and at last they became so outrageous that\r\nthe Doctor, fearing he might get into trouble, left the house, and\r\nmade the best of his way to the nearest wood, leaving me to do as well\r\nas I could among them. I was so enraged with the Governor, that I\r\ncould have wished to have seen him tied fast to a tree and flogged for\r\nhis behaviour; but I had not people enough to cope with his party. I\r\ntherefore thought of a stratagem to appease the riot. Recollecting a\r\npassage I had read in the life of Columbus, when he was amongst the\r\nIndians in Mexico or Peru, where, on some occasion, he frightened\r\nthem, by telling them of certain events in the heavens, I had recourse\r\nto the same expedient; and it succeeded beyond my most sanguine\r\nexpectations. When I had formed my determination, I went in the midst\r\nof them; and, taking hold of the Governor, I pointed up to the\r\nheavens. I menaced him and the rest: I told them God lived there, and\r\nthat he was angry with them, and they must not quarrel so; that they\r\nwere all brothers, and if they did not leave off, and go away quietly,\r\nI would take the book (pointing to the Bible), read, and _tell_ God to\r\nmake them dead. This was something like magic. The clamour immediately\r\nceased, and I gave them some rum and a few other things; after which\r\nthey went away peaceably; and the Governor afterwards gave our\r\nneighbour, who was called Captain Plasmyah, his hat again. When the\r\nDoctor returned, he was exceedingly glad at my success in thus getting\r\nrid of our troublesome guests. The Musquito people within our\r\nvicinity, out of respect to the Doctor, myself and his people, made\r\nentertainments of the grand kind, called in their tongue _tourrie_ or\r\n_dryckbot_. The English of this expression is, a feast of drinking\r\nabout, of which it seems a corruption of language. The drink consisted\r\nof pine apples roasted, and casades chewed or beaten in mortars;\r\nwhich, after lying some time, ferments, and becomes so strong as to\r\nintoxicate, when drank in any quantity. We had timely notice given to\r\nus of the entertainment. A white family, within five miles of us, told\r\nus how the drink was made, and I and two others went before the time\r\nto the village, where the mirth was appointed to be held; and there we\r\nsaw the whole art of making the drink, and also the kind of animals\r\nthat were to be eaten there. I cannot say the sight of either the\r\ndrink or the meat were enticing to me. They had some thousands of pine\r\napples roasting, which they squeezed, dirt and all, into a canoe they\r\nhad there for the purpose. The casade drink was in beef barrels and\r\nother vessels, and looked exactly like hog-wash. Men, women, and\r\nchildren, were thus employed in roasting the pine apples, and\r\nsqueezing them with their hands. For food they had many land torpins\r\nor tortoises, some dried turtle, and three large alligators alive, and\r\ntied fast to the trees. I asked the people what they were going to do\r\nwith these alligators; and I was told they were to be eaten. I was\r\nmuch surprised at this, and went home, not a little disgusted at the\r\npreparations. When the day of the feast was come, we took some rum\r\nwith us, and went to the appointed place, where we found a great\r\nassemblage of these people, who received us very kindly. The mirth had\r\nbegun before we came; and they were dancing with music: and the\r\nmusical instruments were nearly the same as those of any other sable\r\npeople; but, as I thought, much less melodious than any other nation I\r\never knew. They had many curious gestures in dancing, and a variety of\r\nmotions and postures of their bodies, which to me were in no wise\r\nattracting. The males danced by themselves, and the females also by\r\nthemselves, as with us. The Doctor shewed his people the example, by\r\nimmediately joining the women\'s party, though not by their choice. On\r\nperceiving the women disgusted, he joined the males. At night there\r\nwere great illuminations, by setting fire to many pine trees, while\r\nthe dryckbot went round merrily by calabashes or gourds: but the\r\nliquor might more justly be called eating than drinking. One Owden,\r\nthe oldest father in the vicinity, was dressed in a strange and\r\nterrifying form. Around his body were skins adorned with different\r\nkinds of feathers, and he had on his head a very large and high\r\nhead-piece, in the form of a grenadier\'s cap, with prickles like a\r\nporcupine; and he made a certain noise which resembled the cry of an\r\nalligator. Our people skipped amongst them out of complaisance, though\r\nsome could not drink of their tourrie; but our rum met with customers\r\nenough, and was soon gone. The alligators were killed and some of them\r\nroasted. Their manner of roasting is by digging a hole in the earth,\r\nand filling it with wood, which they burn to coal, and then they lay\r\nsticks across, on which they set the meat. I had a raw piece of the\r\nalligator in my hand: it was very rich: I thought it looked like fresh\r\nsalmon, and it had a most fragrant smell, but I could not eat any of\r\nit. This merry-making at last ended without the least discord in any\r\nperson in the company, although it was made up of different nations\r\nand complexions. The rainy season came on here about the latter end of\r\nMay, which continued till August very heavily; so that the rivers were\r\noverflowed, and our provisions then in the ground were washed away. I\r\nthought this was in some measure a judgment upon us for working on\r\nSundays, and it hurt my mind very much. I often wished to leave this\r\nplace and sail for Europe; for our mode of procedure and living in\r\nthis heathenish form was very irksome to me. The word of God saith,\r\n\'What does it avail a man if he gain the whole world, and lose his own\r\nsoul?\' This was much and heavily impressed on my mind; and, though I\r\ndid not know how to speak to the Doctor for my discharge, it was\r\ndisagreeable for me to stay any longer. But about the middle of June I\r\ntook courage enough to ask him for it. He was very unwilling at first\r\nto grant my request; but I gave him so many reasons for it, that at\r\nlast he consented to my going, and gave me the following certificate\r\nof my behaviour:\r\n\r\n     \'The bearer, Gustavus Vassa, has served me several years\r\n     with strict honesty, sobriety, and fidelity. I can,\r\n     therefore, with justice recommend him for these\r\n     qualifications; and indeed in every respect I consider him\r\n     as an excellent servant. I do hereby certify that he always\r\n     behaved well, and that he is perfectly trust-worthy.\r\n\r\n                                               \'CHARLES IRVING.\'\r\n\r\n     _Musquito Shore, June 15, 1776._\r\n\r\nThough I was much attached to the doctor, I was happy when he\r\nconsented. I got every thing ready for my departure, and hired some\r\nIndians, with a large canoe, to carry me off. All my poor countrymen,\r\nthe slaves, when they heard of my leaving them, were very sorry, as I\r\nhad always treated them with care and affection, and did every thing I\r\ncould to comfort the poor creatures, and render their condition easy.\r\nHaving taken leave of my old friends and companions, on the 18th of\r\nJune, accompanied by the doctor, I left that spot of the world, and\r\nwent southward above twenty miles along the river. There I found a\r\nsloop, the captain of which told me he was going to Jamaica. Having\r\nagreed for my passage with him and one of the owners, who was also on\r\nboard, named Hughes, the doctor and I parted, not without shedding\r\ntears on both sides. The vessel then sailed along the river till\r\nnight, when she stopped in a lagoon within the same river. During the\r\nnight a schooner belonging to the same owners came in, and, as she was\r\nin want of hands, Hughes, the owner of the sloop, asked me to go in\r\nthe schooner as a sailor, and said he would give me wages. I thanked\r\nhim; but I said I wanted to go to Jamaica. He then immediately changed\r\nhis tone, and swore, and abused me very much, and asked how I came to\r\nbe freed. I told him, and said that I came into that vicinity with Dr.\r\nIrving, whom he had seen that day. This account was of no use; he\r\nstill swore exceedingly at me, and cursed the master for a fool that\r\nsold me my freedom, and the doctor for another in letting me go from\r\nhim. Then he desired me to go in the schooner, or else I should not go\r\nout of the sloop as a freeman. I said this was very hard, and begged\r\nto be put on shore again; but he swore that I should not. I said I had\r\nbeen twice amongst the Turks, yet had never seen any such usage with\r\nthem, and much less could I have expected any thing of this kind\r\namongst Christians. This incensed him exceedingly; and, with a volley\r\nof oaths and imprecations, he replied, \'Christians! Damn you, you are\r\none of St. Paul\'s men; but by G----, except you have St. Paul\'s or St.\r\nPeter\'s faith, and walk upon the water to the shore, you shall not go\r\nout of the vessel;\' which I now found was going amongst the Spaniards\r\ntowards Carthagena, where he swore he would sell me. I simply asked\r\nhim what right he had to sell me? but, without another word, he made\r\nsome of his people tie ropes round each of my ancles, and also to each\r\nwrist, and another rope round my body, and hoisted me up without\r\nletting my feet touch or rest upon any thing. Thus I hung, without any\r\ncrime committed, and without judge or jury; merely because I was a\r\nfree man, and could not by the law get any redress from a white person\r\nin those parts of the world. I was in great pain from my situation,\r\nand cried and begged very hard for some mercy; but all in vain. My\r\ntyrant, in a great rage, brought a musquet out of the cabin, and\r\nloaded it before me and the crew, and swore that he would shoot me if\r\nI cried any more. I had now no alternative; I therefore remained\r\nsilent, seeing not one white man on board who said a word on my\r\nbehalf. I hung in that manner from between ten and eleven o\'clock at\r\nnight till about one in the morning; when, finding my cruel abuser\r\nfast asleep, I begged some of his slaves to slack the rope that was\r\nround my body, that my feet might rest on something. This they did at\r\nthe risk of being cruelly used by their master, who beat some of them\r\nseverely at first for not tying me when he commanded them. Whilst I\r\nremained in this condition, till between five and six o\'clock next\r\nmorning, I trust I prayed to God to forgive this blasphemer, who cared\r\nnot what he did, but when he got up out of his sleep in the morning\r\nwas of the very same temper and disposition as when he left me at\r\nnight. When they got up the anchor, and the vessel was getting under\r\nway, I once more cried and begged to be released; and now, being\r\nfortunately in the way of their hoisting the sails, they released me.\r\nWhen I was let down, I spoke to one Mr. Cox, a carpenter, whom I knew\r\non board, on the impropriety of this conduct. He also knew the doctor,\r\nand the good opinion he ever had of me. This man then went to the\r\ncaptain, and told him not to carry me away in that manner; that I was\r\nthe doctor\'s steward, who regarded me very highly, and would resent\r\nthis usage when he should come to know it. On which he desired a young\r\nman to put me ashore in a small canoe I brought with me. This sound\r\ngladdened my heart, and I got hastily into the canoe and set off,\r\nwhilst my tyrant was down in the cabin; but he soon spied me out, when\r\nI was not above thirty or forty yards from the vessel, and, running\r\nupon the deck with a loaded musket in his hand, he presented it at me,\r\nand swore heavily and dreadfully, that he would shoot me that instant,\r\nif I did not come back on board. As I knew the wretch would have done\r\nas he said, without hesitation, I put back to the vessel again; but,\r\nas the good Lord would have it, just as I was alongside he was abusing\r\nthe captain for letting me go from the vessel; which the captain\r\nreturned, and both of them soon got into a very great heat. The young\r\nman that was with me now got out of the canoe; the vessel was sailing\r\non fast with a smooth sea: and I then thought it was neck or nothing,\r\nso at that instant I set off again, for my life, in the canoe, towards\r\nthe shore; and fortunately the confusion was so great amongst them on\r\nboard, that I got out of the reach of the musquet shot unnoticed,\r\nwhile the vessel sailed on with a fair wind a different way; so that\r\nthey could not overtake me without tacking: but even before that could\r\nbe done I should have been on shore, which I soon reached, with many\r\nthanks to God for this unexpected deliverance. I then went and told\r\nthe other owner, who lived near that shore (with whom I had agreed for\r\nmy passage) of the usage I had met with. He was very much astonished,\r\nand appeared very sorry for it. After treating me with kindness, he\r\ngave me some refreshment, and three heads of roasted Indian corn, for\r\na voyage of about eighteen miles south, to look for another vessel. He\r\nthen directed me to an Indian chief of a district, who was also the\r\nMusquito admiral, and had once been at our dwelling; after which I set\r\noff with the canoe across a large lagoon alone (for I could not get\r\nany one to assist me), though I was much jaded, and had pains in my\r\nbowels, by means of the rope I had hung by the night before. I was\r\ntherefore at different times unable to manage the canoe, for the\r\npaddling was very laborious. However, a little before dark I got to my\r\ndestined place, where some of the Indians knew me, and received me\r\nkindly. I asked for the admiral; and they conducted me to his\r\ndwelling. He was glad to see me, and refreshed me with such things as\r\nthe place afforded; and I had a hammock to sleep in. They acted\r\ntowards me more like Christians than those whites I was amongst the\r\nlast night, though they had been baptized. I told the admiral I wanted\r\nto go to the next port to get a vessel to carry me to Jamaica; and\r\nrequested him to send the canoe back which I then had, for which I was\r\nto pay him. He agreed with me, and sent five able Indians with a large\r\ncanoe to carry my things to my intended place, about fifty miles; and\r\nwe set off the next morning. When we got out of the lagoon and went\r\nalong shore, the sea was so high that the canoe was oftentimes very\r\nnear being filled with water. We were obliged to go ashore and drag\r\nacross different necks of land; we were also two nights in the swamps,\r\nwhich swarmed with musquito flies, and they proved troublesome to us.\r\nThis tiresome journey of land and water ended, however, on the third\r\nday, to my great joy; and I got on board of a sloop commanded by one\r\nCaptain Jenning. She was then partly loaded, and he told me he was\r\nexpecting daily to sail for Jamaica; and having agreed with me to work\r\nmy passage, I went to work accordingly. I was not many days on board\r\nbefore we sailed; but to my sorrow and disappointment, though used to\r\nsuch tricks, we went to the southward along the Musquito shore,\r\ninstead of steering for Jamaica. I was compelled to assist in cutting\r\na great deal of mahogany wood on the shore as we coasted along it, and\r\nload the vessel with it, before she sailed. This fretted me much; but,\r\nas I did not know how to help myself among these deceivers, I thought\r\npatience was the only remedy I had left, and even that was forced.\r\nThere was much hard work and little victuals on board, except by good\r\nluck we happened to catch turtles. On this coast there was also a\r\nparticular kind of fish called manatee, which is most excellent\r\neating, and the flesh is more like beef than fish; the scales are as\r\nlarge as a shilling, and the skin thicker than I ever saw that of any\r\nother fish. Within the brackish waters along shore there were likewise\r\nvast numbers of alligators, which made the fish scarce. I was on board\r\nthis sloop sixteen days, during which, in our coasting, we came to\r\nanother place, where there was a smaller sloop called the Indian\r\nQueen, commanded by one John Baker. He also was an Englishman, and had\r\nbeen a long time along the shore trading for turtle shells and silver,\r\nand had got a good quantity of each on board. He wanted some hands\r\nvery much; and, understanding I was a free man, and wanted to go to\r\nJamaica, he told me if he could get one or two, that he would sail\r\nimmediately for that island: he also pretended to me some marks of\r\nattention and respect, and promised to give me forty-five shillings\r\nsterling a month if I would go with him. I thought this much better\r\nthan cutting wood for nothing. I therefore told the other captain that\r\nI wanted to go to Jamaica in the other vessel; but he would not listen\r\nto me: and, seeing me resolved to go in a day or two, he got the\r\nvessel to sail, intending to carry me away against my will. This\r\ntreatment mortified me extremely. I immediately, according to an\r\nagreement I had made with the captain of the Indian Queen, called for\r\nher boat, which was lying near us, and it came alongside; and, by the\r\nmeans of a north-pole shipmate which I met with in the sloop I was in,\r\nI got my things into the boat, and went on board of the Indian Queen,\r\nJuly the 10th. A few days after I was there, we got all things ready\r\nand sailed: but again, to my great mortification, this vessel still\r\nwent to the south, nearly as far as Carthagena, trading along the\r\ncoast, instead of going to Jamaica, as the captain had promised me:\r\nand, what was worst of all, he was a very cruel and bloody-minded man,\r\nand was a horrid blasphemer. Among others he had a white pilot, one\r\nStoker, whom he beat often as severely as he did some negroes he had\r\non board. One night in particular, after he had beaten this man most\r\ncruelly, he put him into the boat, and made two negroes row him to a\r\ndesolate key, or small island; and he loaded two pistols, and swore\r\nbitterly that he would shoot the negroes if they brought Stoker on\r\nboard again. There was not the least doubt but that he would do as he\r\nsaid, and the two poor fellows were obliged to obey the cruel mandate;\r\nbut, when the captain was asleep, the two negroes took a blanket and\r\ncarried it to the unfortunate Stoker, which I believe was the means of\r\nsaving his life from the annoyance of insects. A great deal of\r\nentreaty was used with the captain the next day, before he would\r\nconsent to let Stoker come on board; and when the poor man was brought\r\non board he was very ill, from his situation during the night, and he\r\nremained so till he was drowned a little time after. As we sailed\r\nsouthward we came to many uninhabited islands, which were overgrown\r\nwith fine large cocoa nuts. As I was very much in want of provisions,\r\nI brought a boat load of them on board, which lasted me and others for\r\nseveral weeks, and afforded us many a delicious repast in our\r\nscarcity. One day, before this, I could not help observing the\r\nprovidential hand of God, that ever supplies all our wants, though in\r\nthe ways and manner we know not. I had been a whole day without food,\r\nand made signals for boats to come off, but in vain. I therefore\r\nearnestly prayed to God for relief in my need; and at the close of the\r\nevening I went off the deck. Just as I laid down I heard a noise on\r\nthe deck; and, not knowing what it meant, I went directly on the the\r\ndeck again, when what should I see but a fine large fish about seven\r\nor eight pounds, which had jumped aboard! I took it, and admired, with\r\nthanks, the good hand of God; and, what I considered as not less\r\nextraordinary, the captain, who was very avaricious, did not attempt\r\nto take it from me, there being only him and I on board; for the rest\r\nwere all gone ashore trading. Sometimes the people did not come off\r\nfor some days: this used to fret the captain, and then he would vent\r\nhis fury on me by beating me, or making me feel in other cruel ways.\r\nOne day especially, in his wild, wicked, and mad career, after\r\nstriking me several times with different things, and once across my\r\nmouth, even with a red burning stick out of the fire, he got a barrel\r\nof gunpowder on the deck, and swore that he would blow up the vessel.\r\nI was then at my wit\'s end, and earnestly prayed to God to direct me.\r\nThe head was out of the barrel; and the captain took a lighted stick\r\nout of the fire to blow himself and me up, because there was a vessel\r\nthen in sight coming in, which he supposed was a Spaniard, and he was\r\nafraid of falling into their hands. Seeing this I got an axe,\r\nunnoticed by him, and placed myself between him and the powder, having\r\nresolved in myself as soon as he attempted to put the fire in the\r\nbarrel to chop him down that instant. I was more than an hour in this\r\nsituation; during which he struck me often, still keeping the fire in\r\nhis hand for this wicked purpose. I really should have thought myself\r\njustifiable in any other part of the world if I had killed him, and\r\nprayed to God, who gave me a mind which rested solely on himself. I\r\nprayed for resignation, that his will might be done; and the following\r\ntwo portions of his holy word, which occurred to my mind, buoyed up my\r\nhope, and kept me from taking the life of this wicked man. \'He hath\r\ndetermined the times before appointed, and set bounds to our\r\nhabitations,\' Acts xvii. 26. And, \'Who is there amongst you that\r\nfeareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh\r\nin darkness and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord,\r\nand stay upon his God,\' Isaiah 1. 10. And thus by the grace of God I\r\nwas enabled to do. I found him a present help in the time of need, and\r\nthe captain\'s fury began to subside as the night approached: but I\r\nfound,\r\n\r\n    "That he who cannot stem his anger\'s tide\r\n    Doth a wild horse without a bridle ride."\r\n\r\nThe next morning we discovered that the vessel which had caused such a\r\nfury in the captain was an English sloop. They soon came to an anchor\r\nwhere we were, and, to my no small surprise, I learned that Doctor\r\nIrving was on board of her on his way from the Musquito shore to\r\nJamaica. I was for going immediately to see this old master and\r\nfriend, but the captain would not suffer me to leave the vessel. I\r\nthen informed the doctor, by letter, how I was treated, and begged\r\nthat he would take me out of the sloop: but he informed me that it was\r\nnot in his power, as he was a passenger himself; but he sent me some\r\nrum and sugar for my own use. I now learned that after I had left the\r\nestate which I managed for this gentleman on the Musquito shore,\r\nduring which the slaves were well fed and comfortable, a white\r\noverseer had supplied my place: this man, through inhumanity and\r\nill-judged avarice, beat and cut the poor slaves most unmercifully;\r\nand the consequence was, that every one got into a large Puriogua\r\ncanoe, and endeavoured to escape; but not knowing where to go, or how\r\nto manage the canoe, they were all drowned; in consequence of which\r\nthe doctor\'s plantation was left uncultivated, and he was now\r\nreturning to Jamaica to purchase more slaves and stock it again. On\r\nthe 14th of October the Indian Queen arrived at Kingston in Jamaica.\r\nWhen we were unloaded I demanded my wages, which amounted to eight\r\npounds and five shillings sterling; but Captain Baker refused to give\r\nme one farthing, although it was the hardest-earned money I ever\r\nworked for in my life. I found out Doctor Irving upon this, and\r\nacquainted him of the captain\'s knavery. He did all he could to help\r\nme to get my money; and we went to every magistrate in Kingston (and\r\nthere were nine), but they all refused to do any thing for me, and\r\nsaid my oath could not be admitted against a white man. Nor was this\r\nall; for Baker threatened that he would beat me severely if he could\r\ncatch me for attempting to demand my money; and this he would have\r\ndone, but that I got, by means of Dr. Irving, under the protection of\r\nCaptain Douglas of the Squirrel man of war. I thought this exceedingly\r\nhard usage; though indeed I found it to be too much the practice there\r\nto pay free men for their labour in this manner. One day I went with a\r\nfree negroe taylor, named Joe Diamond, to one Mr. Cochran, who was\r\nindebted to him some trifling sum; and the man, not being able to get\r\nhis money, began to murmur. The other immediately took a horse-whip to\r\npay him with it; but, by the help of a good pair of heels, the taylor\r\ngot off. Such oppressions as these made me seek for a vessel to get\r\noff the island as fast as I could; and by the mercy of God I found a\r\nship in November bound for England, when I embarked with a convoy,\r\nafter having taken a last farewell of Doctor Irving. When I left\r\nJamaica he was employed in refining sugars; and some months after my\r\narrival in England I learned, with much sorrow, that this my amiable\r\nfriend was dead, owing to his having eaten some poisoned fish. We had\r\nmany very heavy gales of wind in our passage; in the course of which\r\nno material incident occurred, except that an American privateer,\r\nfalling in with the fleet, was captured and set fire to by his\r\nMajesty\'s ship the Squirrel. On January the seventh, 1777, we arrived\r\nat Plymouth. I was happy once more to tread upon English ground; and,\r\nafter passing some little time at Plymouth and Exeter among some pious\r\nfriends, whom I was happy to see, I went to London with a heart\r\nreplete with thanks to God for all past mercies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n     _Different transactions of the author\'s life till the\r\n     present time--His application to the late Bishop of London\r\n     to be appointed a missionary to Africa--Some account of his\r\n     share in the conduct of the late expedition to Sierra\r\n     Leona--Petition to the Queen--Conclusion._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the various scenes which I was a witness to, and the fortune\r\nI experienced until the year 1777. Since that period my life has been\r\nmore uniform, and the incidents of it fewer, than in any other equal\r\nnumber of years preceding; I therefore hasten to the conclusion of a\r\nnarrative, which I fear the reader may think already sufficiently\r\ntedious.\r\n\r\nI had suffered so many impositions in my commercial transactions in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, that I became heartily disgusted with\r\nthe sea-faring life, and I was determined not to return to it, at\r\nleast for some time. I therefore once more engaged in service shortly\r\nafter my return, and continued for the most part in this situation\r\nuntil 1784.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival in London, I saw a remarkable circumstance\r\nrelative to African complexion, which I thought so extraordinary, that\r\nI beg leave just to mention it: A white negro woman, that I had\r\nformerly seen in London and other parts, had married a white man, by\r\nwhom she had three boys, and they were every one mulattoes, and yet\r\nthey had fine light hair. In 1779 I served Governor Macnamara, who had\r\nbeen a considerable time on the coast of Africa. In the time of my\r\nservice, I used to ask frequently other servants to join me in family\r\nprayers; but this only excited their mockery. However, the Governor,\r\nunderstanding that I was of a religious turn, wished to know of what\r\nreligion I was; I told him I was a protestant of the church of\r\nEngland, agreeable to the thirty-nine articles of that church, and\r\nthat whomsoever I found to preach according to that doctrine, those I\r\nwould hear. A few days after this, we had some more discourse on the\r\nsame subject: the Governor spoke to me on it again, and said that he\r\nwould, if I chose, as he thought I might be of service in converting\r\nmy countrymen to the Gospel faith, get me sent out as a missionary to\r\nAfrica. I at first refused going, and told him how I had been served\r\non a like occasion by some white people the last voyage I went to\r\nJamaica, when I attempted (if it were the will of God) to be the means\r\nof converting the Indian prince; and I said I supposed they would\r\nserve me worse than Alexander the coppersmith did St. Paul, if I\r\nshould attempt to go amongst them in Africa. He told me not to fear,\r\nfor he would apply to the Bishop of London to get me ordained. On\r\nthese terms I consented to the Governor\'s proposal to go to Africa, in\r\nhope of doing good if possible amongst my countrymen; so, in order to\r\nhave me sent out properly, we immediately wrote the following letters\r\nto the late Bishop of London:\r\n\r\n     _To the Right Reverend Father in God_,\r\n          ROBERT, _Lord Bishop of London_:\r\n               The MEMORIAL of Gustavus Vassa\r\n\r\n     Sheweth,\r\n\r\n     That your memorialist is a native of Africa, and has a\r\n     knowledge of the manners and customs of the inhabitants of\r\n     that country.\r\n\r\n     That your memorialist has resided in different parts of\r\n     Europe for twenty-two years last past, and embraced the\r\n     Christian faith in the year 1759.\r\n\r\n     That your memorialist is desirous of returning to Africa as\r\n     a missionary, if encouraged by your Lordship, in hopes of\r\n     being able to prevail upon his countrymen to become\r\n     Christians; and your memorialist is the more induced to\r\n     undertake the same, from the success that has attended the\r\n     like undertakings when encouraged by the Portuguese through\r\n     their different settlements on the coast of Africa, and also\r\n     by the Dutch: both governments encouraging the blacks, who,\r\n     by their education are qualified to undertake the same, and\r\n     are found more proper than European clergymen, unacquainted\r\n     with the language and customs of the country.\r\n\r\n     Your memorialist\'s only motive for soliciting the office of\r\n     a missionary is, that he may be a means, under God, of\r\n     reforming his countrymen and persuading them to embrace the\r\n     Christian religion. Therefore your memorialist humbly prays\r\n     your Lordship\'s encouragement and support in the\r\n     undertaking.\r\n\r\n                                                    GUSTAVUS VASSA.\r\n\r\n     At Mr. Guthrie\'s, taylor,\r\n       No. 17, Hedge-lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n     My Lord,\r\n\r\n     I have resided near seven years on the coast of Africa, for\r\n     most part of the time as commanding officer. From the\r\n     knowledge I have of the country and its inhabitants, I am\r\n     inclined to think that the within plan will be attended with\r\n     great success, if countenanced by your Lordship. I beg leave\r\n     further to represent to your Lordship, that the like\r\n     attempts, when encouraged by other governments, have met\r\n     with uncommon success; and at this very time I know a very\r\n     respectable character a black priest at Cape Coast Castle. I\r\n     know the within named Gustavus Vassa, and believe him a\r\n     moral good man.\r\n\r\n                                          I have the honour to be,\r\n                                              My Lord,\r\n                                                Your Lordship\'s\r\n                                        Humble and obedient servant,\r\n                                              MATT. MACNAMARA.\r\n\r\n     Grove, 11th March 1779.\r\n\r\nThis letter was also accompanied by the following from Doctor Wallace,\r\nwho had resided in Africa for many years, and whose sentiments on the\r\nsubject of an African mission were the same with Governor Macnamara\'s.\r\n\r\n                                               _March 13, 1779_.\r\n\r\n     My Lord,\r\n\r\n     I have resided near five years on Senegambia on the coast of\r\n     Africa, and have had the honour of filling very considerable\r\n     employments in that province. I do approve of the within\r\n     plan, and think the undertaking very laudable and proper,\r\n     and that it deserves your Lordship\'s protection and\r\n     encouragement, in which case it must be attended with the\r\n     intended success.\r\n\r\n                                       I am,\r\n                                          My Lord,\r\n                                             Your Lordship\'s\r\n                                   Humble and obedient servant,\r\n                                                  THOMAS WALLACE.\r\n\r\nWith these letters, I waited on the Bishop by the Governor\'s desire,\r\nand presented them to his Lordship. He received me with much\r\ncondescension and politeness; but, from some certain scruples of\r\ndelicacy, declined to ordain me.\r\n\r\nMy sole motive for thus dwelling on this transaction, or inserting\r\nthese papers, is the opinion which gentlemen of sense and education,\r\nwho are acquainted with Africa, entertain of the probability of\r\nconverting the inhabitants of it to the faith of Jesus Christ, if the\r\nattempt were countenanced by the legislature.\r\n\r\nShortly after this I left the Governor, and served a nobleman in the\r\nDevonshire militia, with whom I was encamped at Coxheath for some\r\ntime; but the operations there were too minute and uninteresting to\r\nmake a detail of.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1783 I visited eight counties in Wales, from motives of\r\ncuriosity. While I was in that part of the country I was led to go\r\ndown into a coal-pit in Shropshire, but my curiosity nearly cost me my\r\nlife; for while I was in the pit the coals fell in, and buried one\r\npoor man, who was not far from me: upon this I got out as fast as I\r\ncould, thinking the surface of the earth the safest part of it.\r\n\r\nIn the spring 1784 I thought of visiting old ocean again. In\r\nconsequence of this I embarked as steward on board a fine new ship\r\ncalled the London, commanded by Martin Hopkin, and sailed for\r\nNew-York. I admired this city very much; it is large and well-built,\r\nand abounds with provisions of all kinds. While we lay here a\r\ncircumstance happened which I thought extremely singular:--One day a\r\nmalefactor was to be executed on a gallows; but with a condition that\r\nif any woman, having nothing on but her shift, married the man under\r\nthe gallows, his life was to be saved. This extraordinary privilege\r\nwas claimed; a woman presented herself; and the marriage ceremony was\r\nperformed. Our ship having got laden we returned to London in January\r\n1785. When she was ready again for another voyage, the captain being\r\nan agreeable man, I sailed with him from hence in the spring, March\r\n1785, for Philadelphia. On the fifth of April we took our departure\r\nfrom the Land\'s-end, with a pleasant gale; and about nine o\'clock that\r\nnight the moon shone bright, and the sea was smooth, while our ship\r\nwas going free by the wind, at the rate of about four or five miles an\r\nhour. At this time another ship was going nearly as fast as we on the\r\nopposite point, meeting us right in the teeth, yet none on board\r\nobserved either ship until we struck each other forcibly head and\r\nhead, to the astonishment and consternation of both crews. She did us\r\nmuch damage, but I believe we did her more; for when we passed by each\r\nother, which we did very quickly, they called to us to bring to, and\r\nhoist out our boat, but we had enough to do to mind ourselves; and in\r\nabout eight minutes we saw no more of her. We refitted as well as we\r\ncould the next day, and proceeded on our voyage, and in May arrived at\r\nPhiladelphia. I was very glad to see this favourite old town once\r\nmore; and my pleasure was much increased in seeing the worthy quakers\r\nfreeing and easing the burthens of many of my oppressed African\r\nbrethren. It rejoiced my heart when one of these friendly people took\r\nme to see a free-school they had erected for every denomination of\r\nblack people, whose minds are cultivated here and forwarded to virtue;\r\nand thus they are made useful members of the community. Does not the\r\nsuccess of this practice say loudly to the planters in the language of\r\nscripture--"Go ye and do likewise?"\r\n\r\nIn October 1785 I was accompanied by some of the Africans, and\r\npresented this address of thanks to the gentlemen called Friends or\r\nQuakers, in Gracechurch-Court Lombard-Street:\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n     By reading your book, entitled a Caution to Great Britain\r\n     and her Colonies, concerning the Calamitous State of the\r\n     enslaved Negroes: We the poor, oppressed, needy, and\r\n     much-degraded negroes, desire to approach you with this\r\n     address of thanks, with our inmost love and warmest\r\n     acknowledgment; and with the deepest sense of your\r\n     benevolence, unwearied labour, and kind interposition,\r\n     towards breaking the yoke of slavery, and to administer a\r\n     little comfort and ease to thousands and tens of thousands\r\n     of very grievously afflicted, and too heavy burthened\r\n     negroes.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, could you, by perseverance, at last be enabled,\r\n     under God, to lighten in any degree the heavy burthen of the\r\n     afflicted, no doubt it would, in some measure, be the\r\n     possible means, under God, of saving the souls of many of\r\n     the oppressors; and, if so, sure we are that the God, whose\r\n     eyes are ever upon all his creatures, and always rewards\r\n     every true act of virtue, and regards the prayers of the\r\n     oppressed, will give to you and yours those blessings which\r\n     it is not in our power to express or conceive, but which we,\r\n     as a part of those captived, oppressed, and afflicted\r\n     people, most earnestly wish and pray for.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen received us very kindly, with a promise to exert\r\nthemselves on behalf of the oppressed Africans, and we parted.\r\n\r\nWhile in town I chanced once to be invited to a quaker\'s wedding. The\r\nsimple and yet expressive mode used at their solemnizations is worthy\r\nof note. The following is the true form of it:\r\n\r\nAfter the company have met they have seasonable exhortations by\r\nseveral of the members; the bride and bridegroom stand up, and, taking\r\neach other by the hand in a solemn manner, the man audily declares to\r\nthis purpose:\r\n\r\n"Friends, in the fear of the Lord, and in the presence of this\r\nassembly, whom I desire to be my witnesses, I take this my friend,\r\nM.N. to be my wife; promising, through divine assistance, to be unto\r\nher a loving and faithful husband till death separate us:" and the\r\nwoman makes the like declaration. Then the two first sign their names\r\nto the record, and as many more witnesses as have a mind. I had the\r\nhonour to subscribe mine to a register in Gracechurch-Court,\r\nLombard-Street.\r\n\r\nWe returned to London in August; and our ship not going immediately to\r\nsea, I shipped as a steward in an American ship called the Harmony,\r\nCaptain John Willet, and left London in March 1786, bound to\r\nPhiladelphia. Eleven days after sailing we carried our foremast away.\r\nWe had a nine weeks passage, which caused our trip not to succeed\r\nwell, the market for our goods proving bad; and, to make it worse, my\r\ncommander began to play me the like tricks as others too often\r\npractise on free negroes in the West Indies. But I thank God I found\r\nmany friends here, who in some measure prevented him. On my return to\r\nLondon in August I was very agreeably surprised to find that the\r\nbenevolence of government had adopted the plan of some philanthropic\r\nindividuals to send the Africans from hence to their native quarter;\r\nand that some vessels were then engaged to carry them to Sierra Leone;\r\nan act which redounded to the honour of all concerned in its\r\npromotion, and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing. There was\r\nthen in the city a select committee of gentlemen for the black poor,\r\nto some of whom I had the honour of being known; and, as soon as they\r\nheard of my arrival they sent for me to the committee. When I came\r\nthere they informed me of the intention of government; and as they\r\nseemed to think me qualified to superintend part of the undertaking,\r\nthey asked me to go with the black poor to Africa. I pointed out to\r\nthem many objections to my going; and particularly I expressed some\r\ndifficulties on the account of the slave dealers, as I would certainly\r\noppose their traffic in the human species by every means in my power.\r\nHowever these objections were over-ruled by the gentlemen of the\r\ncommittee, who prevailed on me to go, and recommended me to the\r\nhonourable Commissioners of his Majesty\'s Navy as a proper person to\r\nact as commissary for government in the intended expedition; and they\r\naccordingly appointed me in November 1786 to that office, and gave me\r\nsufficient power to act for the government in the capacity of\r\ncommissary, having received my warrant and the following order.\r\n\r\n     _By the principal Officers and Commissioners of\r\n     his Majesty\'s Navy_.\r\n\r\n     Whereas you were directed, by our warrant of the 4th of last\r\n     month, to receive into your charge from Mr. Irving the\r\n     surplus provisions remaining of what was provided for the\r\n     voyage, as well as the provisions for the support of the\r\n     black poor, after the landing at Sierra Leone, with the\r\n     cloathing, tools, and all other articles provided at\r\n     government\'s expense; and as the provisions were laid in at\r\n     the rate of two months for the voyage, and for four months\r\n     after the landing, but the number embarked being so much\r\n     less than was expected, whereby there may be a considerable\r\n     surplus of provisions, cloathing, &c. These are, in addition\r\n     to former orders, to direct and require you to appropriate\r\n     or dispose of such surplus to the best advantage you can for\r\n     the benefit of government, keeping and rendering to us a\r\n     faithful account of what you do herein. And for your\r\n     guidance in preventing any white persons going, who are not\r\n     intended to have the indulgences of being carried thither,\r\n     we send you herewith a list of those recommended by the\r\n     Committee for the black poor as proper persons to be\r\n     permitted to embark, and acquaint you that you are not to\r\n     suffer any others to go who do not produce a certificate\r\n     from the committee for the black poor, of their having their\r\n     permission for it. For which this shall be your warrant.\r\n     Dated at the Navy Office, January 16, 1787.\r\n\r\n                                                      J. HINSLOW,\r\n                                                      GEO. MARSH,\r\n                                                      W. PALMER.\r\n\r\n     To Mr. Gustavus Vassa,\r\n     Commissary of Provisions and\r\n     Stores for the Black Poor\r\n     going to Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nI proceeded immediately to the execution of my duty on board the\r\nvessels destined for the voyage, where I continued till the March\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nDuring my continuance in the employment of government, I was struck\r\nwith the flagrant abuses committed by the agent, and endeavoured to\r\nremedy them, but without effect. One instance, among many which I\r\ncould produce, may serve as a specimen. Government had ordered to be\r\nprovided all necessaries (slops, as they are called, included) for 750\r\npersons; however, not being able to muster more than 426, I was\r\nordered to send the superfluous slops, &c. to the king\'s stores at\r\nPortsmouth; but, when I demanded them for that purpose from the agent,\r\nit appeared they had never been bought, though paid for by government.\r\nBut that was not all, government were not the only objects of\r\npeculation; these poor people suffered infinitely more; their\r\naccommodations were most wretched; many of them wanted beds, and many\r\nmore cloathing and other necessaries. For the truth of this, and much\r\nmore, I do not seek credit from my own assertion. I appeal to the\r\ntestimony of Capt. Thompson, of the Nautilus, who convoyed us, to whom\r\nI applied in February 1787 for a remedy, when I had remonstrated to\r\nthe agent in vain, and even brought him to be a witness of the\r\ninjustice and oppression I complained of. I appeal also to a letter\r\nwritten by these wretched people, so early as the beginning of the\r\npreceding January, and published in the Morning Herald of the 4th of\r\nthat month, signed by twenty of their chiefs.\r\n\r\nI could not silently suffer government to be thus cheated, and my\r\ncountrymen plundered and oppressed, and even left destitute of the\r\nnecessaries for almost their existence. I therefore informed the\r\nCommissioners of the Navy of the agent\'s proceeding; but my dismission\r\nwas soon after procured, by means of a gentleman in the city, whom the\r\nagent, conscious of his peculation, had deceived by letter, and whom,\r\nmoreover, empowered the same agent to receive on board, at the\r\ngovernment expense, a number of persons as passengers, contrary to the\r\norders I received. By this I suffered a considerable loss in my\r\nproperty: however, the commissioners were satisfied with my conduct,\r\nand wrote to Capt. Thompson, expressing their approbation of it.\r\n\r\nThus provided, they proceeded on their voyage; and at last, worn out\r\nby treatment, perhaps not the most mild, and wasted by sickness,\r\nbrought on by want of medicine, cloaths, bedding, &c. they reached\r\nSierra Leone just at the commencement of the rains. At that season of\r\nthe year it is impossible to cultivate the lands; their provisions\r\ntherefore were exhausted before they could derive any benefit from\r\nagriculture; and it is not surprising that many, especially the\r\nlascars, whose constitutions are very tender, and who had been cooped\r\nup in ships from October to June, and accommodated in the manner I\r\nhave mentioned, should be so wasted by their confinement as not long\r\nto survive it.\r\n\r\nThus ended my part of the long-talked-of expedition to Sierra Leone;\r\nan expedition which, however unfortunate in the event, was humane and\r\npolitic in its design, nor was its failure owing to government: every\r\nthing was done on their part; but there was evidently sufficient\r\nmismanagement attending the conduct and execution of it to defeat its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI should not have been so ample in my account of this transaction, had\r\nnot the share I bore in it been made the subject of partial\r\nanimadversion, and even my dismission from my employment thought\r\nworthy of being made by some a matter of public triumph[X]. The\r\nmotives which might influence any person to descend to a petty contest\r\nwith an obscure African, and to seek gratification by his depression,\r\nperhaps it is not proper here to inquire into or relate, even if its\r\ndetection were necessary to my vindication; but I thank Heaven it is\r\nnot. I wish to stand by my own integrity, and not to shelter myself\r\nunder the impropriety of another; and I trust the behaviour of the\r\nCommissioners of the Navy to me entitle me to make this assertion; for\r\nafter I had been dismissed, March 24, I drew up a memorial thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of\r\n     his Majesty\'s Treasury:\r\n     The Memorial and Petition of_ Gustavus Vassa _a black Man,\r\n     late Commissary to the black Poor going to_ Africa.\r\n\r\n     HUMBLY SHEWETH,\r\n\r\n     That your Lordships\' memorialist was, by the Honourable the\r\n     Commissioners of his Majesty\'s Navy, on the 4th of December\r\n     last, appointed to the above employment by warrant from that\r\n     board;\r\n\r\n     That he accordingly proceeded to the execution of his duty\r\n     on board of the Vernon, being one of the ships appointed to\r\n     proceed to Africa with the above poor;\r\n\r\n     That your memorialist, to his great grief and astonishment,\r\n     received a letter of dismission from the Honourable\r\n     Commissioners of the Navy, by your Lordships\' orders;\r\n\r\n     That, conscious of having acted with the most perfect\r\n     fidelity and the greatest assiduity in discharging the trust\r\n     reposed in him, he is altogether at a loss to conceive the\r\n     reasons of your Lordships\' having altered the favourable\r\n     opinion you were pleased to conceive of him, sensible that\r\n     your Lordships would not proceed to so severe a measure\r\n     without some apparent good cause; he therefore has every\r\n     reason to believe that his conduct has been grossly\r\n     misrepresented to your Lordships; and he is the more\r\n     confirmed in his opinion, because, by opposing measures of\r\n     others concerned in the same expedition, which tended to\r\n     defeat your Lordships\' humane intentions, and to put the\r\n     government to a very considerable additional expense, he\r\n     created a number of enemies, whose misrepresentations, he\r\n     has too much reason to believe, laid the foundation of his\r\n     dismission. Unsupported by friends, and unaided by the\r\n     advantages of a liberal education, he can only hope for\r\n     redress from the justice of his cause, in addition to the\r\n     mortification of having been removed from his employment,\r\n     and the advantage which he reasonably might have expected to\r\n     have derived therefrom. He has had the misfortune to have\r\n     sunk a considerable part of his little property in fitting\r\n     himself out, and in other expenses arising out of his\r\n     situation, an account of which he here annexes. Your\r\n     memorialist will not trouble your Lordships with a\r\n     vindication of any part of his conduct, because he knows not\r\n     of what crimes he is accused; he, however, earnestly\r\n     entreats that you will be pleased to direct an inquiry into\r\n     his behaviour during the time he acted in the public\r\n     service; and, if it be found that his dismission arose from\r\n     false representations, he is confident that in your\r\n     Lordships\' justice he shall find redress.\r\n\r\n     Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that your Lordships\r\n     will take his case into consideration, and that you will be\r\n     pleased to order payment of the above referred-to account,\r\n     amounting to 32l. 4s. and also the wages intended, which is\r\n     most humbly submitted.\r\n\r\n     _London, May 12, 1787._\r\n\r\nThe above petition was delivered into the hands of their Lordships,\r\nwho were kind enough, in the space of some few months afterwards,\r\nwithout hearing, to order me 50l. sterling--that is, 18l. wages for\r\nthe time (upwards of four months) I acted a faithful part in their\r\nservice. Certainly the sum is more than a free negro would have had in\r\nthe western colonies!!!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarch the 21st, 1788, I had the honour of presenting the Queen with a\r\npetition on behalf of my African brethren, which was received most\r\ngraciously by her Majesty[Y]:\r\n\r\n     _To the_ QUEEN\'s _most Excellent Majesty_.\r\n\r\n     Madam,\r\n\r\n     Your Majesty\'s well known benevolence and humanity emboldens\r\n     me to approach your royal presence, trusting that the\r\n     obscurity of my situation will not prevent your Majesty from\r\n     attending to the sufferings for which I plead.\r\n\r\n     Yet I do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress; my\r\n     sufferings, although numerous, are in a measure forgotten. I\r\n     supplicate your Majesty\'s compassion for millions of my\r\n     African countrymen, who groan under the lash of tyranny in\r\n     the West Indies.\r\n\r\n     The oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes\r\n     there, have at length reached the British legislature, and\r\n     they are now deliberating on its redress; even several\r\n     persons of property in slaves in the West Indies, have\r\n     petitioned parliament against its continuance, sensible that\r\n     it is as impolitic as it is unjust--and what is inhuman must\r\n     ever be unwise.\r\n\r\n     Your Majesty\'s reign has been hitherto distinguished by\r\n     private acts of benevolence and bounty; surely the more\r\n     extended the misery is, the greater claim it has to your\r\n     Majesty\'s compassion, and the greater must be your Majesty\'s\r\n     pleasure in administering to its relief.\r\n\r\n     I presume, therefore, gracious Queen, to implore your\r\n     interposition with your royal consort, in favour of the\r\n     wretched Africans; that, by your Majesty\'s benevolent\r\n     influence, a period may now be put to their misery; and that\r\n     they may be raised from the condition of brutes, to which\r\n     they are at present degraded, to the rights and situation of\r\n     freemen, and admitted to partake of the blessings of your\r\n     Majesty\'s happy government; so shall your Majesty enjoy the\r\n     heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions, and\r\n     be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves, and of\r\n     their posterity.\r\n\r\n     And may the all-bountiful Creator shower on your Majesty,\r\n     and the Royal Family, every blessing that this world can\r\n     afford, and every fulness of joy which divine revelation has\r\n     promised us in the next.\r\n\r\n     I am your Majesty\'s most dutiful and devoted servant to\r\n     command,\r\n\r\n                                         Gustavus Vassa,\r\n                                         The Oppressed Ethiopean.\r\n\r\n     No. 53, Baldwin\'s Gardens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe negro consolidated act, made by the assembly of Jamaica last year,\r\nand the new act of amendment now in agitation there, contain a proof\r\nof the existence of those charges that have been made against the\r\nplanters relative to the treatment of their slaves.\r\n\r\nI hope to have the satisfaction of seeing the renovation of liberty\r\nand justice resting on the British government, to vindicate the honour\r\nof our common nature. These are concerns which do not perhaps belong\r\nto any particular office: but, to speak more seriously to every man of\r\nsentiment, actions like these are the just and sure foundation of\r\nfuture fame; a reversion, though remote, is coveted by some noble\r\nminds as a substantial good. It is upon these grounds that I hope and\r\nexpect the attention of gentlemen in power. These are designs\r\nconsonant to the elevation of their rank, and the dignity of their\r\nstations: they are ends suitable to the nature of a free and generous\r\ngovernment; and, connected with views of empire and dominion, suited\r\nto the benevolence and solid merit of the legislature. It is a pursuit\r\nof substantial greatness.--May the time come--at least the speculation\r\nto me is pleasing--when the sable people shall gratefully commemorate\r\nthe auspicious \xc3\xa6ra of extensive freedom. Then shall those persons[Z]\r\nparticularly be named with praise and honour, who generously proposed\r\nand stood forth in the cause of humanity, liberty, and good policy;\r\nand brought to the ear of the legislature designs worthy of royal\r\npatronage and adoption. May Heaven make the British senators the\r\ndispersers of light, liberty, and science, to the uttermost parts of\r\nthe earth: then will be glory to God on the highest, on earth peace,\r\nand goodwill to men:--Glory, honour, peace, &c. to every soul of man\r\nthat worketh good, to the Britons first, (because to them the Gospel\r\nis preached) and also to the nations. \'Those that honour their Maker\r\nhave mercy on the poor.\' \'It is righteousness exalteth a nation; but\r\nsin is a reproach to any people; destruction shall be to the workers\r\nof iniquity, and the wicked shall fall by their own wickedness.\' May\r\nthe blessings of the Lord be upon the heads of all those who\r\ncommiserated the cases of the oppressed negroes, and the fear of God\r\nprolong their days; and may their expectations be filled with\r\ngladness! \'The liberal devise liberal things, and by liberal things\r\nshall stand,\' Isaiah xxxii. 8. They can say with pious Job, \'Did not I\r\nweep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the\r\npoor?\' Job xxx. 25.\r\n\r\nAs the inhuman traffic of slavery is to be taken into the\r\nconsideration of the British legislature, I doubt not, if a system of\r\ncommerce was established in Africa, the demand for manufactures would\r\nmost rapidly augment, as the native inhabitants will insensibly adopt\r\nthe British fashions, manners, customs, &c. In proportion to the\r\ncivilization, so will be the consumption of British manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe wear and tear of a continent, nearly twice as large as Europe, and\r\nrich in vegetable and mineral productions, is much easier conceived\r\nthan calculated.\r\n\r\nA case in point.--It cost the Aborigines of Britain little or nothing\r\nin clothing, &c. The difference between their forefathers and the\r\npresent generation, in point of consumption, is literally infinite.\r\nThe supposition is most obvious. It will be equally immense in\r\nAfrica--The same cause, viz. civilization, will ever have the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt is trading upon safe grounds. A commercial intercourse with Africa\r\nopens an inexhaustible source of wealth to the manufacturing interests\r\nof Great Britain, and to all which the slave trade is an objection.\r\n\r\nIf I am not misinformed, the manufacturing interest is equal, if not\r\nsuperior, to the landed interest, as to the value, for reasons which\r\nwill soon appear. The abolition of slavery, so diabolical, will give a\r\nmost rapid extension of manufactures, which is totally and\r\ndiametrically opposite to what some interested people assert.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers of this country must and will, in the nature and\r\nreason of things, have a full and constant employ by supplying the\r\nAfrican markets.\r\n\r\nPopulation, the bowels and surface of Africa, abound in valuable and\r\nuseful returns; the hidden treasures of centuries will be brought to\r\nlight and into circulation. Industry, enterprize, and mining, will\r\nhave their full scope, proportionably as they civilize. In a word, it\r\nlays open an endless field of commerce to the British manufactures and\r\nmerchant adventurer. The manufacturing interest and the general\r\ninterests are synonymous. The abolition of slavery would be in reality\r\nan universal good.\r\n\r\nTortures, murder, and every other imaginable barbarity and iniquity,\r\nare practised upon the poor slaves with impunity. I hope the slave\r\ntrade will be abolished. I pray it may be an event at hand. The great\r\nbody of manufacturers, uniting in the cause, will considerably\r\nfacilitate and expedite it; and, as I have already stated, it is most\r\nsubstantially their interest and advantage, and as such the nation\'s\r\nat large, (except those persons concerned in the manufacturing\r\nneck-yokes, collars, chains, hand-cuffs, leg-bolts, drags,\r\nthumb-screws, iron muzzles, and coffins; cats, scourges, and other\r\ninstruments of torture used in the slave trade). In a short time one\r\nsentiment alone will prevail, from motives of interest as well as\r\njustice and humanity. Europe contains one hundred and twenty millions\r\nof inhabitants. Query--How many millions doth Africa contain?\r\nSupposing the Africans, collectively and individually, to expend 5l. a\r\nhead in raiment and furniture yearly when civilized, &c. an immensity\r\nbeyond the reach of imagination!\r\n\r\nThis I conceive to be a theory founded upon facts, and therefore an\r\ninfallible one. If the blacks were permitted to remain in their own\r\ncountry, they would double themselves every fifteen years. In\r\nproportion to such increase will be the demand for manufactures.\r\nCotton and indigo grow spontaneously in most parts of Africa; a\r\nconsideration this of no small consequence to the manufacturing towns\r\nof Great Britain. It opens a most immense, glorious, and happy\r\nprospect--the clothing, &c. of a continent ten thousand miles in\r\ncircumference, and immensely rich in productions of every denomination\r\nin return for manufactures.\r\n\r\nI have only therefore to request the reader\'s indulgence and conclude.\r\nI am far from the vanity of thinking there is any merit in this\r\nnarrative: I hope censure will be suspended, when it is considered\r\nthat it was written by one who was as unwilling as unable to adorn the\r\nplainness of truth by the colouring of imagination. My life and\r\nfortune have been extremely chequered, and my adventures various. Even\r\nthose I have related are considerably abridged. If any incident in\r\nthis little work should appear uninteresting and trifling to most\r\nreaders, I can only say, as my excuse for mentioning it, that almost\r\nevery event of my life made an impression on my mind and influenced my\r\nconduct. I early accustomed myself to look for the hand of God in the\r\nminutest occurrence, and to learn from it a lesson of morality and\r\nreligion; and in this light every circumstance I have related was to\r\nme of importance. After all, what makes any event important, unless by\r\nits observation we become better and wiser, and learn \'to do justly,\r\nto love mercy, and to walk humbly before God?\' To those who are\r\npossessed of this spirit, there is scarcely any book or incident so\r\ntrifling that does not afford some profit, while to others the\r\nexperience of ages seems of no use; and even to pour out to them the\r\ntreasures of wisdom is throwing the jewels of instruction away.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote X: See the Public Advertiser, July 14, 1787.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Y: At the request of some of my most particular friends, I\r\ntake the liberty of inserting it here.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Z: Grenville Sharp, Esq; the Reverend Thomas Clarkson; the\r\nReverend James Ramsay; our approved friends, men of virtue, are an\r\nhonour to their country, ornamental to human nature, happy in\r\nthemselves, and benefactors to mankind!]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Interesting Narrative of the Life\r\nof Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The African, by Olaudah Equiano\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE INTERESTING NARRATIVE OF ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 15399-8.txt or 15399-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/3/9/15399/\r\n\r\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Diane Monico and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
