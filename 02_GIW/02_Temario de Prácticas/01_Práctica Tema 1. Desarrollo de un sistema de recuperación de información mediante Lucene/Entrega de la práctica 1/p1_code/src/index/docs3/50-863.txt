I GO TO STYLES\r\n\r\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\r\ntime as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Styles Case\xe2\x80\x9d has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\r\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\r\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\r\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\r\nsensational rumours which still persist.\r\n\r\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\r\nbeing connected with the affair.\r\n\r\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\r\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\r\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\r\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\r\nparticularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\r\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\r\nI had often stayed at Styles, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s place in Essex.\r\n\r\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\r\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mater will be delighted to see you again\xe2\x80\x94after all those years,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother keeps well?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\r\nhad married John\xe2\x80\x99s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\r\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\r\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\r\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\r\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\r\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\r\nfortune of her own.\r\n\r\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\r\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\r\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\r\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\r\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\r\ntime of their father\xe2\x80\x99s remarriage that they always thought of her as\r\ntheir own mother.\r\n\r\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\r\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\r\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\r\nmarked success.\r\n\r\nJohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\r\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\r\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\r\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\r\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\r\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\r\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\r\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\r\n\r\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s remarriage and\r\nsmiled rather ruefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRotten little bounder too!\xe2\x80\x9d he said savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you,\r\nHastings, it\xe2\x80\x99s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nremember Evie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose she was after your time. She\xe2\x80\x99s the mater\xe2\x80\x99s factotum,\r\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sport\xe2\x80\x94old Evie! Not precisely\r\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were going to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\r\nsecond cousin or something of Evie\xe2\x80\x99s, though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\r\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a great black beard,\r\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\r\nto him at once, took him on as secretary\xe2\x80\x94you know how she\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nrunning a hundred societies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\r\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\r\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\r\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\r\nyears younger than she is! It\xe2\x80\x99s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\r\nthere you are\xe2\x80\x94she is her own mistress, and she\xe2\x80\x99s married him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be a difficult situation for you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifficult! It\xe2\x80\x99s damnable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\r\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\r\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\r\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\r\nto the car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cMainly\r\nowing to the mater\xe2\x80\x99s activities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\r\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\r\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\r\nEssex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\r\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\r\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\r\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\r\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\r\nworks regularly \xe2\x80\x98on the land\xe2\x80\x99. She is up at five every morning to milk,\r\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly good life taking\r\nit all round\xe2\x80\x94if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have started from the hospital by\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCynthia! That\xe2\x80\x99s not your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Cynthia is a prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s, the daughter of an old\r\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\r\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\r\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\r\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\r\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\r\nstraightened herself at our approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Evie, here\xe2\x80\x99s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings\xe2\x80\x94Miss Howard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\r\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\r\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\r\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\r\nfeet to match\xe2\x80\x94these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\r\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeeds grow like house afire. Can\xe2\x80\x99t keep even with \xe2\x80\x99em. Shall press you\r\nin. Better be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a cynic, Evie,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s tea to-day\xe2\x80\x94inside\r\nor out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done enough gardening for to-day. \xe2\x80\x98The labourer\r\nis worthy of his hire\xe2\x80\x99, you know. Come and be refreshed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ninclined to agree with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\r\nof a large sycamore.\r\n\r\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\r\nmeet us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife, Hastings,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\r\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\r\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\r\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\r\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\r\nan exquisitely civilised body\xe2\x80\x94all these things are burnt into my\r\nmemory. I shall never forget them.\r\n\r\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\r\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\r\nhad accepted John\xe2\x80\x99s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\r\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\r\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\r\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\r\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\r\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\r\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\r\nwindow near at hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to\r\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\r\nhear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\r\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nDuchess\xe2\x80\x94about the school f\xc3\xaate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was the murmur of a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s rose\r\nin reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\r\nAlfred dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\r\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\r\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\r\ndeference in his manner.\r\n\r\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\r\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings\xe2\x80\x94my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked with some curiosity at \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred darling\xe2\x80\x9d. He certainly struck a\r\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\r\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\r\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\r\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\r\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\r\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, turning to his wife: \xe2\x80\x9cEmily\r\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\r\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\r\notherwise sensible woman!\r\n\r\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\r\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\r\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\r\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\r\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\r\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\r\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\r\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\r\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\r\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\r\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\r\n\r\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\r\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\r\npainstaking voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, before the war I was in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will return there after it is over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\r\nconsult your inclination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that depends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo secret hobby?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re drawn to something?\r\nEveryone is\xe2\x80\x94usually something absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real thing\xe2\x80\x94Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\r\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\r\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\r\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\r\nmethod. My system is based on his\xe2\x80\x94though of course I have progressed\r\nrather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\r\nwonderfully clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a good detective story myself,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Howard. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of\r\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\r\ndumbfounded. Real crime\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d know at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d I argued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\r\nfamily. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really hoodwink them. They\xe2\x80\x99d know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, much amused, \xe2\x80\x9cyou think that if you were mixed up in a\r\ncrime, say a murder, you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to spot the murderer right off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I should. Mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99m certain I\xe2\x80\x99d know. I\xe2\x80\x99d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be a \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight. But murder\xe2\x80\x99s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in a case of poisoning.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s clear voice startled me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\r\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\r\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Inglethorp. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCynthia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings\xe2\x80\x94Miss Murdoch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\r\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\r\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\r\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\r\nwould have been a beauty.\r\n\r\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\r\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down here on the grass, do. It\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much nicer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dropped down obediently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou work at Tadminster, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Miss Murdoch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they bully you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see them!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cynthia with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got a cousin who is nursing,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is terrified\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98Sisters\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\r\n_are_! You\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea! But I\xe2\x80\x99m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\r\ndispensary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many people do you poison?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hundreds!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCynthia,\xe2\x80\x9d called Mrs. Inglethorp, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think you could write a few\r\nnotes for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Aunt Emily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\r\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\r\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\r\n\r\nMy hostess turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\r\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94she was the late Lord Abbotsbury\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x94does the same. She\r\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\r\nwar household; nothing is wasted here\xe2\x80\x94every scrap of waste paper, even,\r\nis saved and sent away in sacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\r\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\r\nwings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\r\nover the park.\r\n\r\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\r\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\r\nInglethorp call \xe2\x80\x9cCynthia\xe2\x80\x9d impatiently, and the girl started and ran\r\nback to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\r\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\r\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\r\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\r\nas he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\r\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John\xe2\x80\x99s younger\r\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\r\nthat singular expression to his face.\r\n\r\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\r\nmy own affairs.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\r\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\r\n\r\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\r\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\r\n\r\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\r\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\r\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\r\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\r\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Mary, there\xe2\x80\x99s the deuce of a mess. Evie\xe2\x80\x99s had a row with\r\nAlfred Inglethorp, and she\xe2\x80\x99s off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvie? Off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn nodded gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you see she went to the mater, and\xe2\x80\x94Oh,\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s Evie herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\r\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\r\nthe defensive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken my mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Evelyn,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Cavendish, \xe2\x80\x9cthis can\xe2\x80\x99t be true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won\xe2\x80\x99t forget or\r\nforgive in a hurry. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if they\xe2\x80\x99ve only sunk in a bit. Probably\r\nwater off a duck\xe2\x80\x99s back, though. I said right out: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re an old\r\nwoman, Emily, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no fool like an old fool. The man\xe2\x80\x99s twenty\r\nyears younger than you, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you fool yourself as to what he\r\nmarried you for. Money! Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t let him have too much of it. Farmer\r\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\r\ntime he spends over there.\xe2\x80\x99 She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\r\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. He\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lot. You can say\r\nwhat you like to me, but remember what I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you. He\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lot!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Darling Alfred\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98dearest Alfred\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98wicked calumnies\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98wicked\r\nlies\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98wicked woman\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94to accuse her \xe2\x80\x98dear husband!\xe2\x80\x99 The sooner I left\r\nher house the better. So I\xe2\x80\x99m off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\r\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\r\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\r\nthink better of it.\r\n\r\nAs she left the room, Miss Howard\xe2\x80\x99s face changed. She leant towards me\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hastings, you\xe2\x80\x99re honest. I can trust you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\r\nvoice to a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They\xe2\x80\x99re a lot of\r\nsharks\xe2\x80\x94all of them. Oh, I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t one\r\nof them that\xe2\x80\x99s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nprotected her as much as I could. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m out of the way, they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nimpose upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, Miss Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything I can, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure you\xe2\x80\x99re excited and overwrought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, trust me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in the world rather longer than you\r\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\r\nrose and moved to the door. John\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounded outside. With her hand\r\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil\xe2\x80\x94her husband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\r\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\r\n\r\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\r\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\r\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour\r\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Bauerstein,\xe2\x80\x9d said John shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is Dr. Bauerstein?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\r\nbreakdown. He\xe2\x80\x99s a London specialist; a very clever man\xe2\x80\x94one of the\r\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s a great friend of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\r\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\r\nthan Evelyn Howard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\r\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\r\n\r\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\r\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty girl,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked appreciatively.\r\n\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s face hardened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Mrs. Raikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one that Miss Howard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\r\n\r\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\r\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\r\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStyles is really a glorious old place,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to John.\r\n\r\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine property. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be mine some day\xe2\x80\x94should be mine now\r\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so damned hard up as I am now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard up, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Hastings, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you that I\xe2\x80\x99m at my wits\xe2\x80\x99 end\r\nfor money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t your brother help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLawrence? He\xe2\x80\x99s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\r\nverses in fancy bindings. No, we\xe2\x80\x99re an impecunious lot. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\r\nher marriage, of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off, frowning.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\r\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\r\nsecurity. Now that security was removed\xe2\x80\x94and the air seemed rife with\r\nsuspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\r\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\r\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\r\n\r\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\r\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\r\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\r\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\r\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\r\n\r\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\r\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\r\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\r\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\r\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\r\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\r\nlong expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\r\nsee his attraction.\r\n\r\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\r\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\r\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\r\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\r\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\r\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\r\ngarden. I noticed that John\xe2\x80\x99s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\r\nvery excited and restless.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\r\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\r\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\r\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s recitation\r\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\r\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\r\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\r\nacting with her in the tableaux.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\r\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\r\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nour oldest families.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\r\nBauerstein.\r\n\r\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\r\nthat we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\r\nway, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\r\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\r\nin the pony-trap.\r\n\r\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\r\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\r\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\r\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\r\naddressed as \xe2\x80\x9cNibs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of bottles!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\r\nsmall room. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really know what\xe2\x80\x99s in them all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay something original,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Cynthia. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery single person who\r\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\r\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: \xe2\x80\x98What a lot of bottles!\xe2\x80\x99 And I\r\nknow the next thing you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say is: \xe2\x80\x98How many people have you\r\npoisoned?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\r\nmistake, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t joke about it. Come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s have tea. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nall sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npoison cupboard. The big cupboard\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\r\nWe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\r\nThe countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\r\nstern and forbidding expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\r\n\r\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\r\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\r\nenigmatical remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_\xe2\x80\x99m not really here to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis should have been sent up this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister is very sorry. She forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister should read the rules outside the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gathered from the little nurse\xe2\x80\x99s expression that there was not the\r\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\r\nthe dreaded \xe2\x80\x9cSister\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo now it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done until to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d finished Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cynthia graciously, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are very busy, but if we have time\r\nit shall be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\r\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscipline must be maintained?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\r\nwards there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\r\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\r\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\r\nher watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more to do, Nibs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Then we can lock up and go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\r\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\r\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\r\nshy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\r\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\r\nhim. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\r\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\r\nBut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\r\na couple of children.\r\n\r\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\r\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\r\n\r\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\r\nentering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\r\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon ami_ Hastings!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI turned to the pony-trap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\r\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we know Monsieur Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cynthia gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I had no idea\r\nhe was a friend of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\r\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\nas I looked at him inquiringly: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend, she had kindly\r\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\r\nrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\r\nwith gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\r\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\r\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\r\non one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\r\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\r\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\r\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\r\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a\r\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\r\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\r\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\r\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a dear little man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cynthia. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d no idea you knew him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\r\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\r\n\r\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\r\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should there be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\r\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, m\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think, m\xe2\x80\x99m, you\xe2\x80\x99d better get to bed? You\xe2\x80\x99re looking very tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Dorcas\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94not now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve some letters I must\r\nfinish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, m\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed directly after supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious! I wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s up?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Lawrence.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\r\nheel and went out of the house.\r\n\r\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\r\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\r\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, trying to appear as\r\nindifferent as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mrs. Inglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the boudoir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\r\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\r\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\r\n\r\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\r\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\r\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\r\ndesperately controlling herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t show it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen show it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\r\nleast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I might have known you would shield him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! There\xe2\x80\x99s been the most awful row! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it all out of\r\nDorcas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a row?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she\xe2\x80\x99s found him out at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Dorcas there, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. She \xe2\x80\x98happened to be near the door\xe2\x80\x99. It was a real old\r\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes\xe2\x80\x99s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard\xe2\x80\x99s warnings,\r\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\r\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, \xe2\x80\x9cAunt Emily will send him\r\naway, and will never speak to him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\r\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\r\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\r\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconcern in the matter?\r\n\r\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\r\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\r\nme afresh.\r\n\r\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\r\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\r\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\r\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\r\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nretired to her boudoir again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend my coffee in here, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d she called. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just five minutes to\r\ncatch the post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\r\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\r\nit out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not trouble, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Inglethorp. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take it to Emily.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\r\n\r\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\r\n\r\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\r\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost too hot,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have a thunderstorm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\r\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\r\nvoice in the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bauerstein!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cynthia. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a funny time to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\r\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\r\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\r\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\r\nplastered with mud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing, doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must make my apologies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not really mean to\r\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, strolling in from\r\nthe hall. \xe2\x80\x9cHave some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\r\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\r\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\r\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun soon dried me off,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid my appearance is\r\nvery disreputable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\r\nthe girl ran out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\r\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\r\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\r\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\r\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll walk down to the village with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Inglethorp. \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to John. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one\r\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\r\n\r\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\r\nfirst floor of Styles. The servants\xe2\x80\x99 rooms are reached through the door\r\nB. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\r\nInglethorps\xe2\x80\x99 rooms were situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\r\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\r\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\r\nmy scattered thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\r\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\r\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\r\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think we had better do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\r\n\r\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s door violently, but with\r\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\r\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\r\nfrom the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry going through Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dorcas. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, the\r\npoor mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\r\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\r\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\r\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\r\n\r\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\r\nbolted on the inside. What was to be done?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ever shall we\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must try and break the door in, I suppose. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a tough job,\r\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\r\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a try at the door.\r\nHalf a moment, though, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a door into Miss Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, but that\xe2\x80\x99s always bolted. It\xe2\x80\x99s never been undone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we might just see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room. Mary Cavendish was\r\nthere, shaking the girl\xe2\x80\x94who must have been an unusually sound\r\nsleeper\xe2\x80\x94and trying to wake her.\r\n\r\nIn a moment or two he was back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good. That\xe2\x80\x99s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\r\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\r\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\r\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\r\nburst open.\r\n\r\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\r\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\r\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\r\nher. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\r\nthe pillows.\r\n\r\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\r\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\r\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\r\non the corridor.\r\n\r\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\r\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\r\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man\xe2\x80\x99s face. He\r\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\r\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\r\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\r\nthe further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\r\nhim to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\r\ncould see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\r\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\r\nharmless enough.\r\n\r\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s attack seemed to be passing. She was\r\nable to speak in short gasps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter now\xe2\x80\x94very sudden\xe2\x80\x94stupid of me\xe2\x80\x94to lock myself in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\r\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\r\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\r\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Cynthia is quite frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\r\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\r\nThen it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\r\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\r\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\r\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\r\nto behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\r\nto help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\r\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\r\nin an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\r\nmore brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\r\npeculiar fashion.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\r\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\r\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\r\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlfred\xe2\x80\x94Alfred\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\r\n\r\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\r\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\r\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\r\nof his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\r\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\r\nnothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\r\nthat he himself had little hope.\r\n\r\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\r\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\r\n\r\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\r\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\r\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\r\nWith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVe\xe2\x80\x94ry sad. Ve\xe2\x80\x94ry sad,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Dr. Wilkins. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear lady. Always\r\ndid far too much\xe2\x80\x94far too much\xe2\x80\x94against my advice. I warned her. Her\r\nheart was far from strong. \xe2\x80\x98Take it easy,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x94easy\xe2\x80\x99. But no\xe2\x80\x94her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\r\nrebelled. Na\xe2\x80\x94ture\xe2\x80\x94re\xe2\x80\x94belled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\r\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\r\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quite\xe2\x80\x94tetanic in\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to speak to you in private,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Bauerstein. He\r\nturned to John. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\r\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\r\n\r\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\r\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein\xe2\x80\x99s manner had started a\r\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so\xe2\x80\x94peculiar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\r\nvoice to a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe she has been poisoned! I\xe2\x80\x99m certain Dr.\r\nBauerstein suspects it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What?_\xe2\x80\x9d She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\r\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nno\xe2\x80\x94not that\xe2\x80\x94not that!\xe2\x80\x9d And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\r\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\r\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94leave me. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\r\nminute or two. Go down to the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\r\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\r\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. Inglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\r\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s dying words. What lay\r\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\r\n\r\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\r\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\r\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\r\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\r\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Bauerstein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean by that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\r\nunder the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn bent his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, I have no alternative but to agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Wilkins briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe propose that it should take\r\nplace to-morrow night\xe2\x80\x94or rather to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d And he glanced at the\r\ndaylight. \xe2\x80\x9cUnder the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\r\nbe avoided\xe2\x80\x94these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndistress yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\r\npocket, and handed them to John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\r\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctors then departed.\r\n\r\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\r\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\r\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\r\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\r\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\r\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\r\nfelt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\r\nhad come for me to take the lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to ask you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\r\nHe has been a most famous detective.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to let me call him in\xe2\x80\x94to investigate this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94now? Before the post-mortem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, time is an advantage if\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94there has been foul play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lawrence angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion the whole thing is a\r\nmare\xe2\x80\x99s nest of Bauerstein\xe2\x80\x99s! Wilkins hadn\xe2\x80\x99t an idea of such a thing,\r\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\r\nBauerstein\xe2\x80\x99s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\r\ncourse he sees them everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s attitude. He was so seldom\r\nvehement about anything.\r\n\r\nJohn hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t feel as you do, Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to\r\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want any unnecessary scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need have no fear of that. Poirot is\r\ndiscretion itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\r\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\r\nforgive me if I am wronging him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. It was six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I determined to lose no time.\r\n\r\nFive minutes\xe2\x80\x99 delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\r\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\r\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. POIROT INVESTIGATES\r\n\r\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\r\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\r\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\r\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\r\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\r\nIt was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\r\nhis absence?\r\n\r\nHe accosted me eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDenby kept me late last night. It was one o\xe2\x80\x99clock before we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nfinished. Then I found that I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten the latch-key after all. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you hear the news?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\r\nself-sacrificing\xe2\x80\x94such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\r\nwas!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hurry on,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\r\nwas bound.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\r\n\r\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\r\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\r\n\r\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\r\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\r\naffair whilst I dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\r\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\r\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\r\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\r\n\r\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s dying words, of her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\r\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\r\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\r\nthe latter\xe2\x80\x99s innuendoes.\r\n\r\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\r\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\r\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\r\nagitated; you are excited\xe2\x80\x94it is but natural. Presently, when we are\r\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\r\nwill examine\xe2\x80\x94and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\r\nthose of no importance, pouf!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\r\npuffed comically enough\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cblow them away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how are you going to decide\r\nwhat is important, and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t? That always seems the difficulty to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\r\nwith exquisite care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another\xe2\x80\x94so we continue. Does the\r\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\r\nlittle fact\xe2\x80\x94no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing\xe2\x80\x94a link\r\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\r\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\r\nwe put it here!\xe2\x80\x9d He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nsignificant! It is tremendous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY\xe2\x80\x94es\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\r\nbefore it. \xe2\x80\x9cBeware! Peril to the detective who says: \xe2\x80\x98It is so small\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.\xe2\x80\x99 That way lies\r\nconfusion! Everything matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. You always told me that. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I have gone into all the\r\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\r\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances\xe2\x80\x94you are upset.\r\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\r\nparamount importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man\xe2\x80\x99s brain. He\r\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\r\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, anyway, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not see? But it is of the first importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see why,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, rather nettled. \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I can remember,\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\r\nappetite away. That was only natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cit was only natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am ready. We will proceed to the ch\xc3\xa2teau, and study matters on\r\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\r\non one side. Permit me.\xe2\x80\x9d With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_\xc3\x87a y est!_ Now, shall we start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\r\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\r\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\r\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\r\nunder his prolonged gaze.\r\n\r\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\r\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\r\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not as though there was a blood\r\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\r\nnot their own mother. Blood tells\xe2\x80\x94always remember that\xe2\x80\x94blood tells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\r\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\r\nmind, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t see how it has anything to do with the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not mind telling you\xe2\x80\x94though, as you know, it is not my habit to\r\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\r\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\r\ncoffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what time was the coffee served?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore she drank it between then and half-past eight\xe2\x80\x94certainly not\r\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\r\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\r\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\r\nthat extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\r\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\r\ndo not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\r\ncircumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\r\nit. In the meantime, remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\r\nand haggard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHastings\r\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI comprehend perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. It is a matter of precaution only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\r\ncigarette as he did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that fellow Inglethorp is back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I met him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\r\nwas too much for Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\r\nneatly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat difficulty will not exist long,\xe2\x80\x9d pronounced Poirot quietly.\r\n\r\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\r\ncryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\r\nhim to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rooms are locked?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\r\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       02\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\r\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\r\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\r\nany clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you remain there like\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ndo you say it?\xe2\x80\x94ah, yes, the stuck pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\r\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\r\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\r\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\r\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Eh voil\xc3\xa0 une table!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my friend, one may live in a\r\nbig house and yet have no comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\r\n\r\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\r\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\r\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\r\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\r\nwire through the handle.\r\n\r\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\r\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\r\nopposite leading into Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room. That door was also bolted, as I\r\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\r\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\r\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\r\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\r\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\r\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\r\n\r\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\r\nsaucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\r\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\r\nnear it.\r\n\r\nI wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\r\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\r\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCocoa\xe2\x80\x94with\xe2\x80\x94I think\xe2\x80\x94rum in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\r\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\r\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, this is curious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not? Observe the lamp\xe2\x80\x94the chimney is broken in two places; they\r\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\r\nto powder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said wearily, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose someone must have stepped on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, in an odd voice. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone stepped on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\r\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94a trick of his when he was agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon ami_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to me, \xe2\x80\x9csomebody stepped on that cup,\r\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\r\ncontained strychnine or\xe2\x80\x94which is far more serious\xe2\x80\x94because it did not\r\ncontain strychnine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\r\nasking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\r\non with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\r\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\r\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\r\ndespatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\r\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\r\ndone\xe2\x80\x94at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\r\nwash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\r\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\r\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely\xe2\x80\x94even\r\ngoing so far as to smell it.\r\n\r\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\r\nit up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have found in this room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, writing busily, \xe2\x80\x9csix points of\r\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\r\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\r\nfloor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may have been done some time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\r\nfragment of some dark green fabric\xe2\x80\x94only a thread or two, but\r\nrecognizable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was what you sealed up in the envelope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!\xe2\x80\x9d With a\r\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\r\nfloor by the writing-table. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been done since yesterday,\r\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\r\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once\xe2\x80\x94but that is not\r\nto the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\r\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou brought only one candle into the room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\r\nseemed to see something over here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I indicated the mantelpiece\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nabsolutely paralysed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is suggestive\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his\r\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut it was not his candle\r\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\r\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s candle, which is still on the\r\ndressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\r\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you deduce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\r\nuse my own natural faculties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the sixth point?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is the sample of cocoa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI might have included that in the six,\r\nbut I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked quickly round the room. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more to be done\r\nhere, I think, unless\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\r\nin the grate. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fire burns\xe2\x80\x94and it destroys. But by chance\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nmight be\xe2\x80\x94let us see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\r\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\r\ngave a faint exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe forceps, Hastings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\r\nof half charred paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, _mon ami!_\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       03\r\n\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\r\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fragment of a will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked up at him sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not surprised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI expected it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\r\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\r\nbrain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\r\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\r\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\r\nbolted on the inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot briskly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will go. I should like to\r\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid\xe2\x80\x94Dorcas, her name is, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room, and Poirot delayed long\r\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\r\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room as before.\r\n\r\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\r\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\r\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable! What symmetry! Observe that\r\ncrescent; and those diamonds\xe2\x80\x94their neatness rejoices the eye. The\r\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\r\nit not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in\xe2\x80\x94Dorcas\r\nis here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction of the\r\neye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but this affair is more important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\r\nimportance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\r\nchose to take that line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\r\ninterview the brave Dorcas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\r\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\r\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\r\n\r\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\r\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray be seated, mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen years, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\r\nto her, were you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a very good mistress to me, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\r\nyou with Mr. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s full approval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\r\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I ought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Dorcas hesitated.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at her keenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\r\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\r\nyour mistress\xe2\x80\x99s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\r\nthat we should know all\xe2\x80\x94if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\r\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\r\nmurderer to justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dorcas fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, naming no names, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\r\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\r\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say exactly, sir, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t tea-time by a long way.\r\nPerhaps four o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\r\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\r\nangry in here. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly mean to listen, but\xe2\x80\x94well, there it is.\r\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\r\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. \xe2\x80\x98You have lied to\r\nme, and deceived me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\r\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did\xe2\x80\x94but she answered: \xe2\x80\x98How\r\ndare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\r\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\r\nupon our name!\xe2\x80\x99 Again I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what he said, but she went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\r\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\r\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\xe2\x80\x99 Then I\r\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s voice you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir, whose else\xe2\x80\x99s could it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what happened next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\r\ntea\xe2\x80\x94nothing to eat\xe2\x80\x94to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful\xe2\x80\x94so white\r\nand upset. \xe2\x80\x98Dorcas,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a great shock.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for\r\nthat, m\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\r\nm\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x99 She had something in her hand. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was a letter,\r\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\r\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what was written\r\nthere. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\r\nthere: \xe2\x80\x98These few words\xe2\x80\x94and everything\xe2\x80\x99s changed.\xe2\x80\x99 And then she says to\r\nme: \xe2\x80\x98Never trust a man, Dorcas, they\xe2\x80\x99re not worth it!\xe2\x80\x99 I hurried off,\r\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d feel better when she\xe2\x80\x99d drunk it. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsays. \xe2\x80\x98Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather hush it up if I could.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would she be likely to do with it afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\r\ncase of hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that where she usually kept important papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\r\nevery night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did she lose the key of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\r\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she had a duplicate key?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\r\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\r\nthat was lost?\xe2\x80\x9d He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\r\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\r\n\r\nDorcas\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\r\neverywhere for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\r\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\r\ndress in her wardrobe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone else in the house got a green dress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas reflected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Cynthia has a green evening dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight or dark green?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir\xe2\x80\x94not that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot\xe2\x80\x99s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\r\notherwise. He merely remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\r\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _last_ night, sir, I know she didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you know so positively?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have any more made up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite sure of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPositive, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to\r\nsign any paper yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sign a paper? No, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\r\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\r\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\r\ncould tell you, though she\xe2\x80\x99s a careless girl. Never cleared the\r\ncoffee-cups away last night. That\xe2\x80\x99s what happens when I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to\r\nlook after things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot lifted his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\r\nyou. I should like to examine them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time did you go out last evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose and\r\nstrolled to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been admiring these flower beds. How\r\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\r\na gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\r\nA fair sight it was. But now there\xe2\x80\x99s only old Manning, and young\r\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\r\nAh, these are dreadful times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\r\nwill you send Annie to me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. Thank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked,\r\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd about the lost key\r\nand the duplicate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\r\npowders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you find it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. It was Number\r\nSix of my catalogue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\r\nmuch importance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\r\nabout this box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI examined it closely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the label.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI read the label carefully: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\r\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x99 No, I see nothing unusual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the fact that there is no chemist\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, that is odd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\r\nprinted name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\r\nto reply.\r\n\r\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\r\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\r\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\r\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnnie considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\r\nMr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I remember,\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x94oh, yes, one was to Ross\xe2\x80\x99s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\r\none, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Poirot.\r\n\r\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, sir, but it\xe2\x80\x99s clean gone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can have noticed\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\r\ndisappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I want to ask you about something else. There is a\r\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\r\nthat every night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\r\nin the night\xe2\x80\x94whenever she fancied it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it? Plain cocoa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\r\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho took it to her room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, you see there\xe2\x80\x99s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\r\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\r\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\r\ntake it into her room later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe swing door is in the left wing, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\r\nfarther\xe2\x80\x94servants\xe2\x80\x99 side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this side, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time did you bring it up last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went to shut up, sir. About eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\r\nup to bed before I\xe2\x80\x99d finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, between seven-fifteen and eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the cocoa was standing\r\non the table in the left wing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\r\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me. I never took the\r\nsalt near it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think there was salt in it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing it on the tray, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw some salt on the tray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\r\nthe tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress\xe2\x80\x99s room I saw\r\nit at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\r\nasked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\r\nout, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\r\nhad only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\r\nit in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\r\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\r\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her \xe2\x80\x9ccoarse kitchen salt\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\r\nmarvelled at Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\r\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you went into Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room, was the door leading into\r\nMiss Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room bolted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the door into Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room? Did you notice if that was\r\nbolted too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnnie hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say whether it\r\nwas bolted or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\r\nafter you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\r\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\r\nyesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCandle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a candle, only\r\na reading-lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\r\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\r\nand a hot iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your mistress ever have a green dress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a\xe2\x80\x94how do you call it?\xe2\x80\x94a sports coat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot green, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor anyone else in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnnie reflected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\r\nMy pent-up excitement burst forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate you! This is a great discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a great discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\r\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\r\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think that the cocoa\xe2\x80\x94mark well what I say, Hastings, the\r\n_cocoa_\xe2\x80\x94contained strychnine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been salt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot placidly.\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\r\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\r\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\r\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\r\ntype of mind.\r\n\r\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not for me to dictate to you.\r\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most admirable sentiment,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\r\nfeet. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\r\nsmaller desk in the corner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d He tried the roll top tentatively. \xe2\x80\x9cLocked. But perhaps one of\r\nMrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s keys would open it.\xe2\x80\x9d He tried several, twisting and\r\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\r\nof satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9c_Voil\xc3\xa0!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\r\npinch.\xe2\x80\x9d He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\r\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\r\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: \xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, he is a man of method,\r\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA \xe2\x80\x9cman of method\xe2\x80\x9d was, in Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, the highest praise that\r\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\r\n\r\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\r\ndisconnectedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\r\nami?_ There might have been? Yes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his eyes wandered round the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\r\nOnly this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\r\nme. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\r\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\r\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       04\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. \xe2\x80\x9cIT ISN\xe2\x80\x99T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you find this?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s. But what does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say\xe2\x80\x94but it is suggestive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\r\npossession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\r\nmight have taken her own life?\r\n\r\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\r\ndistracted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnow to examine the coffee-cups!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\r\nabout the cocoa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _l\xc3\xa0 l\xc3\xa0!_ That miserable cocoa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot flippantly.\r\n\r\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\r\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with increasing coldness, \xe2\x80\x9cas Mrs. Inglethorp\r\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\r\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\r\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot was sobered at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, slipping his arms through mine. \xe2\x80\x9c_Ne\r\nvous f\xc3\xa2chez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\r\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\r\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\r\nundisturbed as we had left them.\r\n\r\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\r\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray\xe2\x80\x94and poured out. Yes. Then she came\r\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\r\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\r\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s. And the one on the tray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s. I saw him put it down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. One, two, three, four, five\xe2\x80\x94but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\r\nInglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not take coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\r\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\r\nso. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\r\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Bien!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is evident! I had an idea\xe2\x80\x94but clearly I\r\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\r\nmatter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\r\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\r\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\r\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\r\nhad been a great man in his day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast is ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\r\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\r\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\r\nHe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\r\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\r\n\r\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\r\nsending telegrams\xe2\x80\x94one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard\xe2\x80\x94writing\r\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\r\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask how things are proceeding?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo your investigations\r\npoint to my mother having died a natural death\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94or must we prepare\r\nourselves for the worst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Mr. Cavendish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would do well\r\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\r\nof the other members of the family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\r\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\r\nheart failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does, does he? That is very interesting\xe2\x80\x94very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nPoirot softly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mrs. Cavendish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint cloud passed over John\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not the least idea what my wife\xe2\x80\x99s views on the subject are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\r\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot bent his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\r\nas usual\xe2\x80\x94but, hang it all, one\xe2\x80\x99s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\r\nwith a possible murderer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\r\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\r\nforgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nhe did not take it after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\r\nhall drawer. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see if it\xe2\x80\x99s there now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\r\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\r\nreplace it by now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\r\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\r\nfavour. That is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not worry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot smoothly. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you that you need not\r\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\r\nbreakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\r\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\r\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\r\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\r\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\r\na matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\r\nsecretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\r\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nI pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\r\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\r\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\r\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\r\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\r\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\r\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\r\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\r\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\r\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\r\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\r\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\r\n\r\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\r\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\r\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the most beastly headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot solicitously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de t\xc3\xaate_.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\njumped up and took her cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sugar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\r\nsugar-tongs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never take it in coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sacr\xc3\xa9!_\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\r\nreplenished cup.\r\n\r\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\r\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\r\nas green as a cat\xe2\x80\x99s. He had heard or seen something that had affected\r\nhim strongly\xe2\x80\x94but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\r\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wells to see you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to John.\r\n\r\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\r\nInglethorp had written the night before.\r\n\r\nJohn rose immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow him into my study.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he turned to us. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is also Coroner\xe2\x80\x94you understand.\r\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\r\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be an inquest then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\r\nmy curiosity was aroused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? You are not attending to what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, my friend. I am much worried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You cannot be serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\r\nunderstand. My instinct was right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat instinct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\r\n_Chut!_ no more now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\r\n\r\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\r\ntypical lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\r\nreason of our presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand, Wells,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is all strictly\r\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\r\ninvestigation of any kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, quite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wells soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could have\r\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s certificate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\r\nadded rather hesitatingly: \xe2\x80\x9cShall we have to appear as witnesses\xe2\x80\x94all of\r\nus, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, of course\xe2\x80\x94and ah\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\r\nform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint expression of relief swept over John\xe2\x80\x99s face. It puzzled me, for\r\nI saw no occasion for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you know of nothing to the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Wells, \xe2\x80\x9cI had\r\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that arrangement will suit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\r\nmost tragic affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Poirot,\r\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\r\nhave received the letter this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\r\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\r\ngreat importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great pity,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Poirot gravely.\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\r\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you\xe2\x80\x94that is, if it\r\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s death, who would inherit her money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\r\ndoes not object\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d interpolated John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\r\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\r\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\r\nMr. John Cavendish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas not that\xe2\x80\x94pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x94rather unfair to her\r\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\r\nup Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\r\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\r\nand void.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hein!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWas\r\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. She may have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was,\xe2\x80\x9d said John unexpectedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were discussing the matter of\r\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say \xe2\x80\x98her last will.\xe2\x80\x99 Had Mrs.\r\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn an average, she made a new will at least once a year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWells imperturbably. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was given to changing her mind as to her\r\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\r\nher family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, unknown to you, she had made a new\r\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\r\nmember of the family\xe2\x80\x94we will say Miss Howard, for instance\xe2\x80\x94would you be\r\nsurprised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\r\n\r\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\r\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\r\nHoward?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\r\nto Mr. Wells and myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich simplifies matters very much,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He did not finish the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will look through the desk in the boudoir first,\xe2\x80\x9d explained John,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important\r\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\r\ncarefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cit is quite possible that there may be a later\r\nwill than the one in my possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _is_ a later will.\xe2\x80\x9d It was Poirot who spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued my friend imperturbably, \xe2\x80\x9cthere _was_ one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean\xe2\x80\x94there was one? Where is it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurnt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurnt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. See here.\xe2\x80\x9d He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\r\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\r\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut possibly this is an old will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\r\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d broke simultaneously from both men.\r\n\r\nPoirot turned to John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d He rang the bell.\r\n\r\nDorcas answered it in due course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas withdrew.\r\n\r\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\r\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\r\n\r\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\r\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome inside, Manning,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\r\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\r\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\r\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\r\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManning,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, \xe2\x80\x9cthis gentleman will put some questions to you\r\nwhich I want you to answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYessir,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Manning.\r\n\r\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manning\xe2\x80\x99s eye swept over him with a\r\nfaint contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\r\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, me and Willum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\r\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what exactly\xe2\x80\x94she wrote it down for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he did, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what happened next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went on with the begonias, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\r\npaper\xe2\x80\x94under where she\xe2\x80\x99d signed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see anything of what was written above her signature?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nPoirot sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you signed where she told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, first me and then Willum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she do with it afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\r\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time was it when she first called you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout four, I should say, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot earlier? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have been about half-past three?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\r\nfour\xe2\x80\x94not before it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Manning, that will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot pleasantly.\r\n\r\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\r\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\r\ncautiously out of the window.\r\n\r\nWe all looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured John. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an extraordinary coincidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94a coincidence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with\xe2\x80\x94someone yesterday\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\r\nand he had gone very pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\r\nhurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\r\nknow. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\r\nwould have consulted me on the subject\xe2\x80\x94but she had no chance. The will\r\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\r\nI much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\r\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuggestive, or not,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted John, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are most grateful to\r\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\r\nnever have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\r\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\r\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\r\nwindow as it swept past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Wells.\xe2\x80\x9d He went hurriedly out into the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\r\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed John\xe2\x80\x99s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\r\nHoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\r\nof veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\r\nof guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\r\nearnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\r\nand how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\r\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\r\nhad known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\r\nhad remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\r\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\r\n\r\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\r\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\r\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\r\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStarted the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\r\ncar. Quickest way to get here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought not. Come along, breakfast\xe2\x80\x99s not cleared away yet, and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll make you some fresh tea.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to me. \xe2\x80\x9cLook after her,\r\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here\xe2\x80\x99s Monsieur\r\nPoirot. He\xe2\x80\x99s helping us, you know, Evie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\r\nshoulder at John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean\xe2\x80\x94helping us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelping us to investigate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaken who to prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\r\ndied from heart seizure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore fool, Lawrence!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Miss Howard. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course Alfred\r\nInglethorp murdered poor Emily\xe2\x80\x94as I always told you he would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Evie, don\xe2\x80\x99t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\r\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nuntil Friday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot until fiddlesticks!\xe2\x80\x9d The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\r\nmagnificent. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all off your heads. The man will be out of the\r\ncountry by then. If he\xe2\x80\x99s any sense, he won\xe2\x80\x99t stay here tamely and wait\r\nto be hanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she accused him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to the\r\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all\xe2\x80\x94or just enough\r\nto make them dangerous. I ought to know\xe2\x80\x94my own father was a doctor.\r\nThat little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\r\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\r\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s done it. And all you can do\r\nis to murmur silly things about \xe2\x80\x98heart seizure\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98inquest on\r\nFriday.\xe2\x80\x99 You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDash it all, Evie, I can\xe2\x80\x99t haul him down to the local police station\r\nby the scruff of his neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He\xe2\x80\x99s a crafty\r\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she\xe2\x80\x99s missed any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\r\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\r\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\r\nJohn. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\r\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\r\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\r\n\r\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\r\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\r\nHoward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk away,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be able to count upon your help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied gruffly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHanging\xe2\x80\x99s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\r\ngood old times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are at one then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I, too, want to hang the\r\ncriminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlfred Inglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim, or another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\r\nalong. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surrounded by sharks\xe2\x80\x94she was. But it was\r\nonly her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\r\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x94and within two months\xe2\x80\x94hey presto!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Miss Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot very earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cif Mr.\r\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\r\nhang him as high as Haman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\r\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\r\nare the only eyes that have wept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean that I was fond of her\xe2\x80\x94yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\r\nselfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\r\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94and, that way she missed love. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think she ever realized it,\r\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\r\nfooting. I took my stand from the first. \xe2\x80\x98So many pounds a year I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides\xe2\x80\x94not a pair\r\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.\xe2\x80\x99 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x94was very\r\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\r\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\r\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\r\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\r\ngo for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\r\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarm\xe2\x80\x94that we lack fire and\r\nenergy\xe2\x80\x94but trust me, it is not so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\r\nto Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\r\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\r\n\r\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\r\nlowered his voice confidentially:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen when these two meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill she be able to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord only knows. There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, Inglethorp himself won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ntoo keen on meeting her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got the keys still, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you, Poirot?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, as we\r\nreached the door of the locked room.\r\n\r\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\r\nThe lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not locked now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee.\xe2\x80\x9d And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Milles tonnerres!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot, dumbfounded. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x94who have both\r\nthe keys in my pocket!\xe2\x80\x9d He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\r\nstiffened. \xe2\x80\x9c_Eh voil\xc3\xa0 une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot laid down the case again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\r\n\r\nPoirot answered them categorically\xe2\x80\x94almost mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\r\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\r\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\r\nmantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\r\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\r\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, it was like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was something in\r\nthat case\xe2\x80\x94some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\r\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\r\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\r\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\r\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\r\nthus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\r\nbeen something of great importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. \xe2\x80\x9cThat, I do not know! A\r\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\r\nDorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d his anger burst\r\nforth freely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmiserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\r\nbehaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\r\nshould have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\r\ngone. It is destroyed\xe2\x80\x94but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nmust leave no stone unturned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\r\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\r\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\r\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\r\nHe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s rather upset about something,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked feebly. I really did\r\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\r\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\r\nand turn the conversation by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t met yet, have they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, rather taken aback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d She was smiling in her quiet way. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see a good\r\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\r\nmuch, and saying so little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s anxious to keep them apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, John!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld John\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully good sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\r\ngreat surprise:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you my friend too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a very bad friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\r\nall about them the next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\r\nand not in the best of taste:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\r\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\r\nwoman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\r\nwhilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\r\n\r\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\r\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\r\ndiplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\r\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\r\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\r\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\r\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\r\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cis this wise? Surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the\r\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\r\nthe criminal\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so, Hastings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\r\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go, _mon ami_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have finished here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\r\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\r\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d she turned inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s medicines?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly her powders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they were bromide powders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\r\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\r\neyes turned green like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s. They were shining like emeralds now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a little idea, a very\r\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet\xe2\x80\x94it fits in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\r\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\r\nwas only too plain and apparent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have made one more discovery, _l\xc3\xa0-bas_,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, jerking his\r\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wells told me\r\nas we were going upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLocked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\r\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\r\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wells\xe2\x80\x94and to John Cavendish also. It was\r\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x94not Dorcas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr. Inglethorp know of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne might take that with a grain of salt,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked sceptically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\r\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\r\nyesterday afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\r\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, often. I suppose everyone has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\r\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\r\nsee if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\r\nwill notice that the word \xe2\x80\x98possessed\xe2\x80\x99 is spelt first with one \xe2\x80\x98s\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nsubsequently with two\xe2\x80\x94correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\r\nin a sentence, thus: \xe2\x80\x98I am possessed.\xe2\x80\x99 Now, what did that tell me? It\r\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word \xe2\x80\x98possessed\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\r\nin my mind, the possibility of a will\xe2\x80\x94(a document almost certain to\r\ncontain that word)\xe2\x80\x94occurred to me at once. This possibility was\r\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\r\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\r\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\r\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\r\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\r\non the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\r\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\r\nboth of the gardeners\xe2\x80\x94for there were two sets of footprints in the\r\nbed\xe2\x80\x94had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\r\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\r\nand they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\r\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\r\ngardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\r\nin my supposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was very ingenious,\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help admitting. \xe2\x80\x9cI must confess\r\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\r\nerroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\r\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\r\nlikely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother point\xe2\x80\x94how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\r\nbeen lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\r\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\r\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\r\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\r\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\r\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\r\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\r\nlock of the despatch-case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred Inglethorp, without doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very sure of his guilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\r\nclearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are several points in\r\nhis favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see only one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he was not in the house last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bad shot!\xe2\x80\x99 as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\r\nmy mind tells against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\r\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\r\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\r\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\r\nreason of his own for his absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that reason?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked sceptically.\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\r\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel\xe2\x80\x94but that does not of necessity\r\nmake him a murderer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not agree, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us leave it. Time will\r\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\r\ncase. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\r\nwere bolted on the inside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I considered. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must look at it logically.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted\xe2\x80\x94our own eyes have\r\ntold us that\xe2\x80\x94yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\r\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\r\nentered the room. You agree so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, encouraged, \xe2\x80\x9cas the person who entered did not do so by\r\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\r\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\r\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\r\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room\xe2\x80\x94a most\r\nunusual proceeding on her part\xe2\x80\x94she had had a most violent quarrel with\r\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\r\nInglethorp herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\r\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\r\nmorning, and bolted it then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot, is that seriously your opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\r\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\r\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten that,\xe2\x80\x9d I said thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is as enigmatical as\r\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\r\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\r\ncertainly not her affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certainly curious,\xe2\x80\x9d I agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, it is unimportant, and\r\nneed not be taken into account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA groan burst from Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\r\nthe fact will not fit the theory\xe2\x80\x94let the theory go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, nettled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\r\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\r\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\r\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\r\nannoyance vanished.\r\n\r\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\r\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\r\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\r\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\r\nwas extraordinary\xe2\x80\x94a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Poirot!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nHe leant forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tiens!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Mr. Mace, from the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop. He is\r\ncoming here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\r\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little minute,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot from the window. \xe2\x80\x9cI come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\r\nopened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Poirot, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d just come back from the Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\r\nThey do say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he lowered his voice cautiously\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat it\xe2\x80\x99s poison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot\xe2\x80\x99s face remained quite impassive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, exactly\xe2\x80\x94of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The young man hesitated, and then his\r\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\r\nhis voice to a whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cJust tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t strychnine, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\r\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\r\nPoirot\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nodding gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will have evidence to give at the\r\ninquest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\r\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\r\nsome disorder\xe2\x80\x94which is not well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\r\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\r\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\r\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\r\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\r\nimportant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was a glorious day!\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cPoirot, you\xe2\x80\x99re pulling my\r\nleg!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\r\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the second point?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\r\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot, I cannot believe you are serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am absolutely serious, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is childish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is very momentous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd supposing the Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\r\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\r\nmake a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\r\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\r\nstands practically in the position of local squire. Also,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nplacidly, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should not allow it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ would not allow it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\r\namusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\r\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d He got up and laid his\r\nhand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\r\ncame into his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\r\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved\xe2\x80\x94no. But she was\r\nvery good to us Belgians\xe2\x80\x94I owe her a debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\r\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_\xe2\x80\x94when a word from me\r\ncould save him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE INQUEST\r\n\r\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\r\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\r\ninto the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\r\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\r\ndriving at.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\r\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\r\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\r\nthe farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\r\nme cunningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99m from the Hall, bain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\r\nthis way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\r\nfrom the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been here, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ay, he\xe2\x80\x99s been here, right enough. More\xe2\x80\x99n once too. Friend of\r\nyours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty lot!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, as\r\ncarelessly as I could.\r\n\r\nHe winked at me knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal\r\ngentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\r\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s liberality with another woman\xe2\x80\x99s money. Had that piquant\r\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\r\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\r\n\r\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\r\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\r\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\r\nwas four-thirty, and not four o\xe2\x80\x99clock when she had heard the voices.\r\n\r\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\r\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when\r\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\r\n\r\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\r\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\r\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\r\n\r\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\r\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\r\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\r\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\r\ntoxicology.\r\n\r\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\r\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\r\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\r\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\r\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\r\ngrain or slightly over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked the Coroner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\r\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\r\nplaced on its sale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\r\nwas administered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\r\nhurried there as fast as I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you relate to us exactly what happened next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entered Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room. She was at that moment in a typical\r\ntetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alfred\xe2\x80\x94Alfred\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\r\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\r\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\r\nhave been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\r\ncoffee after dinner about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, whereas the symptoms did not\r\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\r\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\r\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\r\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the doctor was continuing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat I would have been\r\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\r\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\r\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\r\npowerless to mask it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\r\nthe taste of strychnine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\r\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\r\nanalyzing its contents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein\xe2\x80\x99s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\r\non all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\r\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\r\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\r\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\r\nher own life.\r\n\r\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\r\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\r\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to make a suggestion if I may?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\r\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just an idea of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Lawrence. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I may be\r\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother\xe2\x80\x99s death might be\r\naccounted for by natural means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\r\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Coroner.\r\n\r\nThe jury looked up, interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lawrence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there have been cases where the\r\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\r\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\r\noverdose of her medicine by accident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\r\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\r\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\r\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\r\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\r\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is\r\nabsurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\r\ntaken an overdose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\r\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\r\ntime, as she dealt with Coot\xe2\x80\x99s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\r\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\r\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\r\nway instrumental in causing her death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. The supposition is ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\r\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, of course, is always possible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor.\r\n\r\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\r\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\r\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\r\n\r\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\r\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\r\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s bell, and had\r\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\r\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\r\n\r\nDorcas\xe2\x80\x99s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\r\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\r\n\r\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\r\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\r\nCoroner\xe2\x80\x99s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\r\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\r\nsound of something heavy falling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would have been the table by the bed?\xe2\x80\x9d commented the Coroner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI opened my door,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cand listened. In a few minutes a\r\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\r\nwe all went to my mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s room, but it was locked\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\r\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\r\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\r\nday before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\r\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\r\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is gaining time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Coroner deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were\r\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\r\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\r\nwas news to him as well.\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\r\nshe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the boudoir window was open, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\r\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\r\nyou were than in the hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really do not remember hearing anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you did not hear voices?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the habit of\r\nlistening to private conversations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\r\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\r\nconversation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something\xe2\x80\x94I do not remember\r\nexactly what\xe2\x80\x94about causing scandal between husband and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d the Coroner leant back satisfied. \xe2\x80\x9cThat corresponds with what\r\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\r\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\r\nyou were?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\r\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\r\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\r\nquietly enough:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is all you can tell us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\r\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\r\nmore if she chose.\r\n\r\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\r\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\r\nat Styles.\r\n\r\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\r\ndocument. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\r\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\r\n\r\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\r\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not hear the table fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I was fast asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good conscience makes a sound sleeper,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\r\nMiss Murdoch, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\r\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\r\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\r\nfacsimile:\r\n\r\nSTYLES COURT\r\nESSEX\r\nhand written note:\r\n\r\n     July 17th\r\n     My dear Evelyn\r\n     Can we not bury\r\n     the hachet? I have\r\n     found it hard to forgive\r\n     the things you said\r\n     against my dear husband\r\n     but I am an old woman\r\n     & very fond of you\r\n     Yours affectionately,\r\n    Emily Inglethorpe\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear it does not help us much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Coroner, with a sigh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlain as a pikestaff to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Howard shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shows\r\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nmade a fool of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt says nothing of the kind in the letter,\xe2\x80\x9d the Coroner pointed out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\r\n_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to own that I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\r\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk\xe2\x80\x94talk\xe2\x80\x94talk!\r\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss Howard, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\r\n\r\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s assistant.\r\n\r\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\r\nCoroner\xe2\x80\x99s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\r\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\r\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast Monday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday? Not Tuesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, Monday, the 16th.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell us to whom you sold it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\r\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\r\nfrom the young man\xe2\x80\x99s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\r\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\r\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure of what you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Coroner sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\r\ncounter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s frown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, sir\xe2\x80\x94of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\r\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\r\ndog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hall\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94especially when it might result in custom being transferred\r\nfrom Coot\xe2\x80\x99s to the local establishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the book here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\r\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\r\n\r\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\r\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\r\nneck?\r\n\r\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\r\npoisoning a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\r\nwhich is in perfect health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\r\nMonday last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you also deny _this_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\r\ninscribed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\r\nshow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\r\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is your explanation of Mr. Mace\xe2\x80\x99s statement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mace must have been mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\r\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally\xe2\x80\x94I cannot remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Coroner sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cThink\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInglethorp shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what direction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really can\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s face grew graver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you in company with anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you meet anyone on your walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Coroner dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am to take it then that\r\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\r\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like to take it that way, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, Mr. Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sacr\xc3\xa9!_\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\r\narrested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\r\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\r\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been misinformed.\r\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\r\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anyone who can testify to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Inglethorp haughtily.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\r\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose witnesses were mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\r\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\r\nhis face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\r\nAlfred Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s guilt?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Inglethorp,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Coroner, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have heard your wife\xe2\x80\x99s dying\r\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\r\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\r\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Poirot to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is an idea, that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think it is true?\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou read my wife\xe2\x80\x99s last words as an accusation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Inglethorp was\r\ncontinuing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\r\nand took it to your wife that evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\r\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\r\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\r\nminutes later, it was gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\r\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\r\ntime to introduce the poison.\r\n\r\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\r\nsitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\r\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\r\n\r\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who that little man is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard\xe2\x80\x94Jimmy Japp.\r\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\r\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\r\nofficial personages.\r\n\r\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\r\nbeing given:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\r\n\r\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\r\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\r\nScotland Yard men.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\r\naccosted the shorter of the two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Poirot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Inspector. He turned to the\r\nother man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\r\nI worked together\xe2\x80\x94the Abercrombie forgery case\xe2\x80\x94you remember, he was run\r\ndown in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\r\nremember \xe2\x80\x98Baron\xe2\x80\x99 Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\r\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\r\nAntwerp\xe2\x80\x94thanks to Mr. Poirot here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\r\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\r\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nPoirot.\r\n\r\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere I differ from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man\xe2\x80\x99s caught\r\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your fire, Summerhaye,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked jocularly. \xe2\x80\x9cMe and Moosier\r\nhere have met before\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s no man\xe2\x80\x99s judgment I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner take than\r\nhis. If I\xe2\x80\x99m not greatly mistaken, he\xe2\x80\x99s got something up his sleeve.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that so, moosier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have drawn certain conclusions\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\r\nscrutiny of Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen the case from the\r\noutside. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the Yard\xe2\x80\x99s at a disadvantage in a case of this\r\nkind, where the murder\xe2\x80\x99s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\r\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where Mr.\r\nPoirot\xe2\x80\x99s had the start of us. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been here as soon as\r\nthis even, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\r\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\r\nhints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\r\nwife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring\r\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\r\nit hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the Coroner\xe2\x80\x94he seemed to be holding them back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Poirot.\r\n\r\nA kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpressive countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I have, and perhaps I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked dryly.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\r\n\r\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink\xe2\x80\x99s as good as a\r\nnod\xe2\x80\x94from you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the spot\xe2\x80\x94and the Yard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make\r\nany mistakes, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\r\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos\xe2\x80\x94the case\r\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme \xc3\xa7a!_\xe2\x80\x9d And he snapped his\r\nfingers expressively.\r\n\r\nJapp\xe2\x80\x99s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\r\nconclude that Poirot was mad.\r\n\r\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daren\xe2\x80\x99t do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_\xe2\x80\x99d take your word, but there\xe2\x80\x99s others\r\nover me who\xe2\x80\x99ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you give me\r\na little more to go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI admit I do not wish it. It forces\r\nmy hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\r\npresent, but what you say is very just\xe2\x80\x94the word of a Belgian policeman,\r\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\r\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\r\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in about half an hour. We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Call for me in passing\xe2\x80\x94the last house in the village. I will go\r\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nis probable\xe2\x80\x94I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\r\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Japp heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, on behalf of the Yard,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you, though I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to confess I can\xe2\x80\x99t at present\r\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\r\nwere a marvel! So long, then, moosier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do\r\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\r\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\r\nsay anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nremarked. \xe2\x80\x9cFor, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\r\nhimself except by silence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, in a thousand ingenious ways,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cSee; say that it is\r\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\r\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s stony denials!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\r\nseriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\r\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninnocence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the evidence is so conclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, too conclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\r\nfamiliar stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, too conclusive,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Poirot, almost to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cReal\r\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\r\nexamined\xe2\x80\x94sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\r\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured\xe2\x80\x94so cleverly\r\nthat it has defeated its own ends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you make that out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\r\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\r\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\r\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\r\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\r\nfool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\r\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\r\nemploy the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\r\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\r\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s assistant must\r\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\r\nthat any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\r\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill\xe2\x80\x94I do not see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_\xe2\x80\x94Hercule\r\nPoirot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\r\nstrychnine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery simply. He did _not_ buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mace recognized him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\r\nMr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\r\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\r\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\r\nInglethorp dealt principally with Coot\xe2\x80\x99s in Tadminster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\r\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\r\na black beard, and uses glasses,\xe2\x80\x9d I quoted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\r\nLawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course an actor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\r\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\r\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\r\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\r\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\r\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\r\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\r\nsomeone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\r\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s guilt. It was\r\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\r\nsure thing there must be tangible proof\xe2\x80\x94such as the actual buying of\r\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\r\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\r\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\r\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\r\nInglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, fascinated by Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, if that\r\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Monday\r\nevening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, why indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, calming down. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he were arrested, he\r\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\r\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\r\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\r\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\r\nquite apart from the murder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d I mused, won over to Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s views for the moment,\r\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\r\nwas the correct one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you not guess?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Poirot, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago\xe2\x80\x94and it has turned out to be\r\ncorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never told me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said reproachfully.\r\n\r\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\r\nto me earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94you see now that he must not be arrested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\r\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\r\nno harm.\r\n\r\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, changing the subject, \xe2\x80\x9capart from Mr.\r\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pretty much what I expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid nothing strike you as peculiar about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s evidence for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lawrence! No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. He\xe2\x80\x99s always a nervous chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\r\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\r\nstrange\xe2\x80\x94 _hein?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\r\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\r\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. I never thought of that.\xe2\x80\x9d I was rather startled. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n_is_ odd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\r\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\r\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\r\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\r\nMonsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\r\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence\xe2\x80\x94no!\r\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\r\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very confusing,\xe2\x80\x9d I agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is Mrs. Cavendish,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another who\r\nis not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\r\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\r\nof that \xe2\x80\x98private conversation\xe2\x80\x99 than she was willing to admit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\r\neavesdrop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\r\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\r\nafternoon, about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as she said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Poirot.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\r\nin the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\r\nfact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has insomnia, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d I said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is a very good, or a very bad explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\r\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny more faults to find with the evidence?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired satirically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon ami_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you find that people are not\r\ntelling you the truth\xe2\x80\x94look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\r\ninquest to-day only one\xe2\x80\x94at most, two persons were speaking the truth\r\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come now, Poirot! I won\xe2\x80\x99t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s John\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard\xe2\x80\x99s evidence,\r\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\r\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\r\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s sagacity\xe2\x80\x94except on\r\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as \xe2\x80\x9cfoolishly\r\npig-headed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard had always seemed to me\r\nso essentially honest\xe2\x80\x94almost uncomfortably so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\r\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Murdoch too,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing untruthful about\r\n_her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\r\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\r\ndistinctly heard the table fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s young. And she sleeps soundly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\r\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\r\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\r\n\r\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\r\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\r\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\r\nset out for Styles.\r\n\r\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\r\nshock\xe2\x80\x94especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\r\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\r\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\r\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\r\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\r\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\r\nto make his boast good.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\r\nhis belief in Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, but a man of the type of\r\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\r\ncould supply.\r\n\r\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\r\nwhich Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\r\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\r\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\r\ntangible reality. We had read of such things\xe2\x80\x94now we ourselves were\r\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\r\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWEALTHY LADY POISONED\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of \xe2\x80\x9cThe family leaving\r\nthe Inquest\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\r\nthat one had read a hundred times\xe2\x80\x94things that happen to other people,\r\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\r\nfront of us were \xe2\x80\x9cthe detectives in charge of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d The well-known\r\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\r\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\r\n\r\nI think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\r\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\r\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, \xe2\x80\x9cI have asked you to come here\r\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\r\nInglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself\xe2\x80\x94I think, unconsciously,\r\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him\xe2\x80\x94and he gave a faint\r\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Inglethorp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, addressing him directly, \xe2\x80\x9ca very dark\r\nshadow is resting on this house\xe2\x80\x94the shadow of murder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Emily! It is terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot pointedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you quite\r\nrealize how terrible it may be\xe2\x80\x94for you.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Inglethorp did not\r\nappear to understand, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\r\nvery grave danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution \xe2\x80\x9cAnything you\r\nsay will be used in evidence against you,\xe2\x80\x9d actually hovering on\r\nSummerhaye\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Poirot went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand now, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot deliberately, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are suspected of\r\npoisoning your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Inglethorp, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a monstrous idea!\r\n_I_\xe2\x80\x94poison my dearest Emily!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Poirot watched him narrowly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat you quite realize\r\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\r\nInglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\r\nsay where you were at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Monday afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\r\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried menacingly.\r\n\r\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\r\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\r\nof what you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Soit!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I must speak for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? How can you speak? You do not know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off abruptly.\r\n\r\nPoirot turned to face us. \xe2\x80\x9c_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\r\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\r\nand purchased strychnine at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Monday last was not Mr.\r\nInglethorp, for at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\r\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\r\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\r\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\r\nRaikes\xe2\x80\x99s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\r\nvillage. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. FRESH SUSPICIONS\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\r\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\r\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Voil\xc3\xa0!_ I have prepared a list of them\xe2\x80\x94names and addresses. You must\r\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d Japp lowered his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you. A\r\npretty mare\xe2\x80\x99s nest arresting him would have been.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to\r\nInglethorp. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, sir, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say all\r\nthis at the inquest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you why,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a certain\r\nrumour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most malicious and utterly untrue one,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Alfred\r\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\r\npresent. Am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right.\xe2\x80\x9d Inglethorp nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cWith my poor Emily not yet buried,\r\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\r\nstarted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween you and me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Japp, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d sooner have any amount\r\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\r\npoor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for Mr.\r\nPoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was foolish, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Inglethorp. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not know,\r\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.\xe2\x80\x9d And he shot a\r\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Japp, turning briskly to John, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, please, and after that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little chat with\r\nthe servants. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\r\nshow me the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\r\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, go to the other wing. Stand there\xe2\x80\x94just this side of the baize\r\ndoor. Do not move till I come.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\r\ntwo detectives.\r\n\r\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\r\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\r\nin this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\r\ncorridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\r\nCynthia Murdoch\xe2\x80\x99s, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s room was in this left wing. Had that\r\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\r\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not stirred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Was he pleased, or disappointed? \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen nothing at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have probably heard something? A big bump\xe2\x80\x94eh, _mon ami?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\r\nclumsy. I made but a slight gesture\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I know Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s gestures\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwith the\r\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\r\nconsole him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\r\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\r\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s with Mrs. Raikes than we\r\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\r\ngoing to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\r\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, looking out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Bauerstein. I\r\nbelieve you\xe2\x80\x99re right about that man, Poirot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is clever,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Poirot meditatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\r\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!\xe2\x80\x9d And I\r\ndescribed the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s adventure. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looked a regular scarecrow!\r\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw him, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Of course, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come in\xe2\x80\x94it was just after dinner\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cWas Dr.\r\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\r\ndid you not tell me? Why? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I expostulated, \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought it would interest\r\nyou. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was of any importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImportance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\r\non Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x94the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\r\nThat alters everything\xe2\x80\x94everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\r\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that alters everything\xe2\x80\x94everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Allons!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\r\nclue. May I take your motor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course. Do you mean at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\r\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked resignedly, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you will tell me what\r\nall this is about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\r\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\r\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\r\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\r\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\r\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\r\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\r\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\r\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\r\nthat at the inquest\xe2\x80\x94but now it has a very different significance. We\r\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\r\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\r\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\r\ngo near the coffee\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is so.\xe2\x80\x9d I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\r\nMary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn clearing Alfred Inglethorp,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been obliged\r\nto show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\r\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\r\nbe doubly careful. Yes\xe2\x80\x94doubly careful.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to me abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nme, Hastings, you yourself\xe2\x80\x94have you no suspicions of anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\r\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\r\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it a suspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so utterly\r\nfoolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Poirot encouragingly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not fear. Speak your mind.\r\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d I blurted out, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s absurd\xe2\x80\x94but I suspect Miss Howard of\r\nnot telling all she knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh at me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued blunderingly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat we\xe2\x80\x99ve rather\r\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\r\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\r\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\r\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot unexpectedly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can. One of my first\r\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x94a convoy coming in unexpectedly\xe2\x80\x94she had kindly offered to\r\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\r\ndisposes of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, rather nonplussed. \xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s her\r\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\r\nsuspecting her. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling she\xe2\x80\x99d do anything against him. And\r\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\r\nwill. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\r\none in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou consider her vehemence unnatural?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY\xe2\x80\x94es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\r\nsane on that point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head energetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\r\ndegenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\r\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\nridiculous one, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94that she had intended to poison him\xe2\x80\x94and that,\r\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t at\r\nall see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\r\nridiculous to the last degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\r\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\r\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\r\nHoward\xe2\x80\x99s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she was devoted to her!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTcha! Tcha!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cYou argue like a child. If Miss\r\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\r\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\r\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\r\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\r\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\r\nwhich I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused a minute, then went on. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, to my way of\r\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard\xe2\x80\x99s being the\r\nmurderess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s death benefit Miss\r\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reflected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\r\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\r\nsame position, so I used her name instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\r\nafternoon of her death may\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\r\nBut I can tell you this much\xe2\x80\x94it was not in Miss Howard\xe2\x80\x99s favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\r\nso positive about the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\r\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\r\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I say about her evidence at the inquest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\r\nsuspicion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\r\nto say this to him. \xe2\x80\x98I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 Nothing more.\r\nNothing less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\xe2\x80\x99 Is that\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, much mystified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\r\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s all extremely mysterious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnalytical Chemist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\r\nback again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, in lively curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left something to be analysed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that has already been tested!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, stupefied. \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bauerstein\r\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\r\nbeing strychnine in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding of Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\r\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\r\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\r\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s innocence had been so\r\ntriumphantly vindicated.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\r\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\r\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\r\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd really it\xe2\x80\x99s a great relief to think he\xe2\x80\x99s going, Hastings,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued my honest friend. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was bad enough before, when we thought\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d done it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m hanged if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worse now, when we all feel\r\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\r\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\r\none doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s damned awkward! And I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful he\xe2\x80\x99s had the tact to take\r\nhimself off. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing Styles wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the mater\xe2\x80\x99s to leave to\r\nhim. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He\xe2\x80\x99s welcome\r\nto her money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to keep up the place all right?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\r\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\r\nof course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\r\nfinancially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s approaching departure, we had the\r\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\r\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\r\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\r\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\r\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\r\n\r\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\r\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\r\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\r\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\r\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\r\nfashionable life: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\xe2\x80\x9d was the topic of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\r\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\r\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\r\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\r\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\r\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\r\ntongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\r\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\r\nundiscovered crimes?\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\r\nshe might have a few words with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. What is it, Dorcas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s just this, sir. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\r\nto-day perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, you know how he asked me so\r\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. You have found one?\xe2\x80\x9d My interest was aroused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that, sir. But since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve remembered what the young\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94John and Lawrence were still the \xe2\x80\x9cyoung gentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nDorcas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccall the \xe2\x80\x98dressing-up box.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s up in the front attic, sir. A\r\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\r\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\r\nthem. So, if you\xe2\x80\x99d tell the Belgian gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell him, Dorcas,\xe2\x80\x9d I promised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\r\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\r\nprying about, and asking questions. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with foreigners as a\r\nrule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\r\nBelges isn\xe2\x80\x99t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he\xe2\x80\x99s a most\r\npolite spoken gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\r\nmine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\r\nservant that is so fast dying out.\r\n\r\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\r\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\r\ngave him Dorcas\xe2\x80\x99s message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although\xe2\x80\x94but no\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94we will examine it all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\r\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\r\n\r\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\r\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\r\ngarment.\r\n\r\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\r\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\r\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\r\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\r\nwas a magnificent black beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Oh\xc3\xb3!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9c_Oh\xc3\xb3!_\xe2\x80\x9d He turned it over in his hands,\r\nexamining it closely. \xe2\x80\x9cNew,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite new.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\r\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\r\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\r\nbusily polishing her silver.\r\n\r\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\r\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\r\nthey often used, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\r\nhave what the young gentlemen call \xe2\x80\x98a dress-up night.\xe2\x80\x99 And very funny\r\nit is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. Most comic! I shall\r\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\r\ncalled it\xe2\x80\x94a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\r\nhis hand, and \xe2\x80\x98Mind, Dorcas,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be very\r\nrespectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it\xe2\x80\x99s off with\r\nyour head if I\xe2\x80\x99m at all displeased with you!\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Cynthia, she was\r\nwhat they call an Apache, or some such name\xe2\x80\x94a Frenchified sort of\r\ncut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You\xe2\x80\x99d never have\r\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\r\nsuch a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese evenings must have been great fun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot genially. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\r\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did have a beard, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dorcas, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd well I know\r\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know as\r\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\r\nI think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\r\nhair. Burnt corks they use mostly\xe2\x80\x94though \xe2\x80\x98tis messy getting it off\r\nagain. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot\r\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it is _the_ one?\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered eagerly.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. You notice it had been trimmed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s, and I found one\r\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho put it in the chest, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone with a good deal of intelligence,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Poirot dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\r\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\r\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\r\nof being intelligent at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI acquiesced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\r\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be\r\ninvaluable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s next words were not so\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have an ally in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed reflectively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have me,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, but you are not sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\r\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see. How about John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dear fellow isn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps very bright,\xe2\x80\x9d I said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes Miss Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is the very\r\nperson. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\r\nStill, we can but try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest for a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 conversation.\r\n\r\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Monsieur Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Howard impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it? Out\r\nwith it. I\xe2\x80\x99m busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d The lady nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I told you I\xe2\x80\x99d help you with\r\npleasure\xe2\x80\x94to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Poirot studied her seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard, I will ask you one\r\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever tell lies,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Howard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\r\nher husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t think your pretty\r\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop. What of that? I dare\r\nsay he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is arsenic\xe2\x80\x94not strychnine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\r\njust as well as strychnine. If I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced he did it, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\r\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Howard. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I always told you the man\r\nis a villain? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\r\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I always hated him like poison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cThat bears out my little idea entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat little idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\r\nof my friend\xe2\x80\x99s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\r\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\r\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\r\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\r\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\r\nnonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\r\nInglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot curtly. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause your instinct is not against Mr.\r\nInglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\r\ncapable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\r\nit. It tells you more\xe2\x80\x94shall I go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\r\nmovement of the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\r\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\r\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\r\ntells you another name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay it! Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say it! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t true! It can\xe2\x80\x99t be true. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat put such a wild\xe2\x80\x94such a dreadful\xe2\x80\x94idea into my head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am right, am I not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me about it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miss Howard, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I shan\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou. I won\xe2\x80\x99t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x94I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\r\ncommon end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to help you, because I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lift a finger\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing\xe2\x80\x94but you will\r\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\r\nthing that I want of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will watch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help doing that. I am always watching\xe2\x80\x94always hoping I\r\nshall be proved wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we are wrong, well and good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one will be more\r\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\r\nHoward, on whose side are you then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could be hushed up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be no hushing up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Emily herself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is unworthy of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nflung her head up proudly. \xe2\x80\x9c_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\r\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.\xe2\x80\x9d And with these words,\r\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, looking after her, \xe2\x80\x9cgoes a very valuable ally.\r\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstinct is a marvellous thing,\xe2\x80\x9d mused Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can neither be\r\nexplained nor ignored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nobserved coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that _I_ am still in the\r\ndark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Is that so, _mon ami?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Enlighten me, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\r\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, look here, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo is enough for a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\r\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\r\na question of ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, it would be interesting to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly, \xe2\x80\x9c_you_ have no instincts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was intelligence you were requiring just now,\xe2\x80\x9d I pointed out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two often go together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot enigmatically.\r\n\r\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\r\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\r\nimportant discoveries\xe2\x80\x94as no doubt I should\xe2\x80\x94I would keep them to myself,\r\nand surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\r\n\r\nThere are times when it is one\xe2\x80\x99s duty to assert oneself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. DR. BAUERSTEIN\r\n\r\nI had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s message to\r\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\r\ngrudge against my friend\xe2\x80\x99s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\r\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\r\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\r\nOtherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\r\ndid not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\r\nLawrence\xe2\x80\x99s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\r\npart, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for you,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked untruthfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The truth is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a message for you\xe2\x80\x94from Poirot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to wait until I was alone with you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, dropping my\r\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\r\neye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\r\ncreating an atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\r\nany idea of what I was about to say?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the message.\xe2\x80\x9d I dropped my voice still lower. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Find the extra\r\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth does he mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. Do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was compelled to shake my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat extra coffee-cup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\r\ncoffee-cups. It\xe2\x80\x99s their business, not mine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about\r\nthe coffee-cups, except that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some that are never used, which\r\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a connoisseur, are you,\r\nHastings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s pure delight to\r\nhandle it, or even to look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what am I to tell Poirot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. It\xe2\x80\x99s double Dutch to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\xe2\x80\x99 Are you sure\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it means?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him earnestly.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said musingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x94I wish I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\r\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\r\nseated at the table.\r\n\r\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\r\non the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\r\nhad been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\r\nleant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\r\nlittle idea\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clittle ideas\xe2\x80\x9d were becoming a perfect\r\nbyword\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand would like to ask one or two questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf me? Certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\r\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\r\nit was bolted, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it was bolted,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaid so at the inquest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBolted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are sure it was bolted, and not merely\r\nlocked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see what you mean. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I said bolted, meaning that\r\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\r\nwere found bolted on the inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\r\nbeen locked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room, whether that door was bolted or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I believe it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x94never looked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ did,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Lawrence suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI happened to notice\r\nthat it _was_ bolted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that settles it.\xe2\x80\x9d And Poirot looked crestfallen.\r\n\r\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his \xe2\x80\x9clittle ideas\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhad come to naught.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\r\nstiffly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are annoyed, is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked anxiously, as we walked\r\nthrough the park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d I said coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\r\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\r\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave Lawrence your message,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\r\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\r\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\r\n\r\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\r\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\r\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure she would be delighted. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting little place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she go there every day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\r\nThose are her only times off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia is clever\xe2\x80\x94oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\r\nhave very strong poisons there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\r\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\r\nthe key before leaving the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, right the other side of the room. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wondered. That is all. Will you come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had reached the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\r\nthrough the woods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\r\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\r\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\r\nfaint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\r\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\r\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\r\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\r\n\r\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\r\nfar off.\r\n\r\nI yawned again.\r\n\r\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\r\nbad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\r\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\r\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI woke up with a start.\r\n\r\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\r\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\r\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\r\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\r\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, Mary, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s voice came, cool and liquid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave _you_ any right to criticize my actions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\r\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she shrugged her shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cif it is only village gossip that\r\nyou mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nPolish Jew, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she looked\r\nat him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\r\nrose to John\xe2\x80\x99s face in a crimson tide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d Her tone did not change.\r\n\r\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\r\nexpress wishes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou defy me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\r\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _do_ see, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, that _you_ have\r\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d he said unsteadily. He stretched\r\nout his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cMary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\r\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his voice was very quiet now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care you in love with this fellow\r\nBauerstein?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\r\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\r\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\r\n\r\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\r\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\r\n\r\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\r\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\r\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\r\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\r\nworld it is, though!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find it so?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, yes! There\xe2\x80\x99s this terrible business to start with. Scotland\r\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\r\nwhere they won\xe2\x80\x99t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\r\nthe country\xe2\x80\x94damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\r\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\r\nTussaud\xe2\x80\x99s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\r\nPretty thick, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, John!\xe2\x80\x9d I said soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t last for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\r\nhold up our heads again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting morbid on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\r\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworse than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn lowered his voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever thought, Hastings\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a nightmare to me\xe2\x80\x94who did it? I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\r\nBecause\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x94who could have done it? Now Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s out of the\r\nway, there\xe2\x80\x99s no one else; no one, I mean, except\xe2\x80\x94one of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\r\nsurely it must be so, unless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94-\r\n\r\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\r\nlight increased. Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious doings, his hints\xe2\x80\x94they all fitted\r\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\r\nwhat a relief for us all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, John,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of us. How could it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but, still, who else is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you guess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bauerstein!\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what earthly interest could he have in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I don\xe2\x80\x99t see,\xe2\x80\x9d I confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you this: Poirot thinks\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot? Does he? How do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him of Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\r\nBauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said twice: \xe2\x80\x98That alters everything.\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking. You\r\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\r\nwas just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that, as\r\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\r\ninto the coffee in passing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d said John. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been very risky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it was possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink that will wash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I had remembered something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t how it was done. Listen.\xe2\x80\x9d And I then\r\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\r\n\r\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it either until now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou understand? Bauerstein had it analysed\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s just it! If\r\nBauerstein\xe2\x80\x99s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\r\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\r\ntested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\r\ndream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\r\nsample\xe2\x80\x94except Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, with belated recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won\xe2\x80\x99t disguise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s admittedly one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest toxicologists\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest what? Say it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows more about poisons than almost anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nmy idea is, that perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s found some way of making strychnine\r\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\r\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m, yes, that might be,\xe2\x80\x9d said John. \xe2\x80\x9cBut look here, how could he have\r\ngot at the cocoa? That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted reluctantly.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\r\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\r\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\r\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\r\nDr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\r\n\r\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\r\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\r\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\r\nevening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\r\nBauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\r\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\r\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\r\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\r\n\r\nYes, it all fitted in.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested \xe2\x80\x9chushing it up.\xe2\x80\x9d Now I understood\r\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: \xe2\x80\x9cEmily herself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And in my heart I\r\nagreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\r\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\r\nof Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\r\nof his voice made me start guiltily. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething which makes me doubt if\r\nwhat you say can be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\r\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\r\nheart disease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Perhaps he thought it\r\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\r\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\r\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\r\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\r\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s possible,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted John. \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blest if\r\nI can see what his motive could have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI trembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\r\nthis is in confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course\xe2\x80\x94that goes without saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\r\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\r\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\r\n\r\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\r\nand told her of Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s wish to visit the dispensary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! I\xe2\x80\x99d love him to see it. He\xe2\x80\x99d better come to tea there one\r\nday. I must fix it up with him. He\xe2\x80\x99s such a dear little man! But he\r\n_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\r\nput it in again, because he said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite a mania with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\r\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hastings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter tea, I want to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\r\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\r\nto me to wonder about the girl\xe2\x80\x99s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\r\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\r\nprobably insist on her making her home with them\xe2\x80\x94at any rate until the\r\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\r\nto let her go.\r\n\r\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\r\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound those detectives! I can\xe2\x80\x99t think what they\xe2\x80\x99re after! They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen in every room in the house\xe2\x80\x94turning things inside out, and upside\r\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\r\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLot of Paul Prys,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Miss Howard.\r\n\r\nLawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\r\ninto the woods together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\r\nthe leafy screen.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\r\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\r\nto quivering gold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hastings\xe2\x80\x94you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\r\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask your advice. What shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\r\nsuppose she forgot, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t think she was likely to die\xe2\x80\x94anyway, I am\r\n_not_ provided for! And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. Do you think I ought\r\nto go away from here at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, no! They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to part with you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\r\nThen she said: \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHates you?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, astonished.\r\n\r\nCynthia nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but she can\xe2\x80\x99t bear me; and _he_ can\xe2\x80\x99t, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere I know you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d I said warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, John is\r\nvery fond of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes\xe2\x80\x94_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\r\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather horrid when no one loves\r\nyou, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they do, Cynthia dear,\xe2\x80\x9d I said earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you are\r\nmistaken. Look, there is John\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Howard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, John likes me, I think, and of\r\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be unkind to a fly. But\r\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\r\nbring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\r\nher to, but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want me, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\r\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\r\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\r\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\r\nloneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\r\nawkwardly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry me, Cynthia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\r\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was a little annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\r\nmy wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfunny dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly sweet of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got. You don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, that settles it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said stiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nanything to laugh at. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing funny about a proposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cynthia. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody might accept you next time.\r\nGood-bye, you\xe2\x80\x99ve cheered me up _very_ much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\r\nthrough the trees.\r\n\r\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\r\nlook up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\r\nAt the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\r\nhave as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\r\nmy diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApartments\xe2\x80\x9d card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\r\ntapped on the door.\r\n\r\nAn old woman came and opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d I said pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Dr. Bauerstein in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s took.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTook? Dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, took by the perlice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the police!\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean they\xe2\x80\x99ve arrested him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE ARREST\r\n\r\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\r\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\r\n\r\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\r\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\r\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\r\n\r\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\r\nwas uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\r\nall probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\r\nresolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\r\narrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\r\nmyself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\r\nbe a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\r\nsuspicions of her. She could not be implicated\xe2\x80\x94otherwise I should have\r\nheard some hint of it.\r\n\r\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\r\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein\xe2\x80\x99s arrest from her. It would be announced in\r\nevery newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\r\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\r\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\r\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\r\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\r\n\r\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\r\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\r\n\r\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it at the\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\r\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\r\ngenerally known to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn reflected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwe won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything at present. There\r\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\r\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\r\nThere was a column of mere padding about \xe2\x80\x9cThe Styles Poisoning Case,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\r\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\r\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\r\nmight be further arrests to come.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\r\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\r\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Bonjour, mon ami!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\r\ndragged him into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\r\nI have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what you are talking\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Bauerstein\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Bauerstein arrested, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d But, pausing a moment, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\r\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\r\ncoast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coast?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has that got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, it is obvious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\r\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we were\r\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cDr.\r\nBauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\r\nfriend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no one exactly told me,\xe2\x80\x9d I confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he is arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspionage?\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nPoirot placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but I thought you thought so too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\r\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never suspected it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never entered my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\r\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\r\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, of course, a German by birth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\r\nhim as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\r\nyears ago. A very clever man\xe2\x80\x94a Jew, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blackguard!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\r\nlose. I admire the man myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I could not look at it in Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s philosophical way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\r\nall over the country!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Poirot.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\r\nother vagaries of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s passed unobserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you think he never really cared for her?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked eagerly\xe2\x80\x94rather\r\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, of course, I cannot say, but\xe2\x80\x94shall I tell you my own private\r\nopinion, Hastings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\r\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d I could not disguise my pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\r\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\r\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\r\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\r\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\r\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\r\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn top of the wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she hurriedly left the room.\r\n\r\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\r\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial\xe2\x80\x94J. or L.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\r\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\r\nPoirot\xe2\x80\x99s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\r\nParkson\xe2\x80\x99s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\r\nMary, Essex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be T., or it might be L.,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, after studying the thing\r\nfor a minute or two. \xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t a J.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. \xe2\x80\x9cI, also, am of\r\nyour way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did it come from?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked curiously. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it important?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cModerately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\r\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\r\nbeen successful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she mean by \xe2\x80\x98On the top of the wardrobe\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe meant,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot promptly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she found it on top of a\r\nwardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA funny place for a piece of brown paper,\xe2\x80\x9d I mused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\r\npaper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\r\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9chave you made up your mind about this\r\ncrime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\r\ncalling out in French in his excitement: \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Dorcas,\r\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s\xe2\x80\x99il vous pla\xc3\xaet!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Dorcas, I have an idea\xe2\x80\x94a little idea\xe2\x80\x94if it should prove\r\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\r\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\r\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s bell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas looked very surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you came\r\nto hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\r\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\r\nthe morning-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee you, one should not ask for outside proof\xe2\x80\x94no, reason should be\r\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\r\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\r\nleap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\r\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your remarkable little friend doing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a voice behind me,\r\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\r\nI. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\r\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\r\nyou see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ridiculous! He\xe2\x80\x99s going out of the gate. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he coming back\r\nto-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given up trying to guess what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\r\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\r\nin his madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\r\nseemed grave, almost sad.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\r\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\r\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\r\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\r\nof encountering any unkindness from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 But again\r\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\r\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hastings,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I and my husband are happy\r\ntogether?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it is your business or not, I will\r\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\r\n\r\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\r\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\r\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about me, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere I come\r\nfrom, who I was before I married John\xe2\x80\x94anything, in fact? Well, I will\r\ntell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94yes, I am sure you are kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\r\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a\r\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was English,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cavendish, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my mother was a\r\nRussian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I understand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hint of something foreign\xe2\x80\x94different\xe2\x80\x94that there has always been about\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, because I never\r\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\r\nsome tragedy connected with her death\xe2\x80\x94she took an overdose of some\r\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\r\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\r\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\r\nbeen nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life\xe2\x80\x94I loved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\r\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\r\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.\xe2\x80\x9d She shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand\r\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\r\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I met\r\nJohn Cavendish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can imagine that, from my aunts\xe2\x80\x99 point of view, it was a very good\r\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\r\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\r\nmonotony of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\r\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\r\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls \xe2\x80\x98in love\xe2\x80\x99 with\r\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and so\xe2\x80\x94we were married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\r\nShe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\x94I am sure\xe2\x80\x94he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\r\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He\xe2\x80\x94it is not a pleasing\r\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth\xe2\x80\x94tired of me very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d I must\r\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, he\r\ndid! Not that it matters now\xe2\x80\x94now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the parting of the\r\nways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and John are not going to live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn may live here, but I shall not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to leave him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94because I want to be\xe2\x80\x94free!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\r\nof forests, untrodden lands\xe2\x80\x94and a realization of what freedom would\r\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\r\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\r\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, how this hateful place has been prison\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything rash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rash!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice mocked at my prudence.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn was so kind as to break that to me this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the arrest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\r\nhad told John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\r\ncare, or did she not?\r\n\r\nShe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\r\nmoving\xe2\x80\x94thank you, Mr. Hastings.\xe2\x80\x9d And she walked quietly past me out of\r\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\r\n\r\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\r\npart with that icy unconcern.\r\n\r\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\r\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\r\n\r\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence\xe2\x80\x94or rather\r\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\r\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\r\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\r\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\r\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\r\na firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\r\nof Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\r\nof Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\r\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone to London again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. \xe2\x80\x98To see a\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s dispensary,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilly ass!\xe2\x80\x9d I ejaculated. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him Wednesday was the one day she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\r\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\r\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI could go if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything special.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing much, but\xe2\x80\x94well, if you are going, will you tell him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndropped his voice to a whisper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve found the extra\r\ncoffee-cup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s, but now my\r\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\r\n\r\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\r\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\r\n\r\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\r\nWould I mount? I mounted accordingly.\r\n\r\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\r\nsprang up at my entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked solicitously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not ill, I trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether to catch the criminal or not?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked facetiously.\r\n\r\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To speak or not to speak,\xe2\x80\x99 as your so great Shakespeare says, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nis the question.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not serious, Poirot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\r\nthe balance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, _mon ami_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely.\r\n\r\nI did not quite know what to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moment has come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand I do not know\r\nwhat to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\r\nbut I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!\xe2\x80\x9d And he tapped himself proudly\r\non the breast.\r\n\r\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\r\neffect, I gave him Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\r\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\r\nLawrence of yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence; but I\r\nforebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\r\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s days off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\r\nwas most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\r\neverything in the kindest way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\r\nanother day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him about the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI always had hopes of that letter. But\r\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe tapped his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cThese little grey cells. It is \xe2\x80\x98up to them\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nyou say over here.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, suddenly, he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a judge of\r\nfinger-marks, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, rather surprised, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that there are no two\r\nfinger-marks alike, but that\xe2\x80\x99s as far as my science goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\r\nlaid on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI studied the proofs attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady\xe2\x80\x99s; they are\r\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I paused for\r\nsome time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\r\nvery distinctly, are No. 1\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOverlapping the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou recognize them beyond fail?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; they are identical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat as usual, you are not going to explain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\r\nNo. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\r\nmerely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\r\ncomplicated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\r\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\r\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\r\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\r\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\r\ntime. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks\xe2\x80\x94it remains to\r\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on\xe2\x80\x94I am really excited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\r\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\r\nCross Hospital at Tadminster\xe2\x80\x94which sounds like the house that Jack\r\nbuilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what were Lawrence Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\r\nday we were there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, he did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible! We were all together the whole time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\r\nThere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\r\nwould not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\r\njoin you on the balcony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten that,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was only for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong enough for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot\xe2\x80\x99s smile became rather enigmatical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\r\nvery natural interest and curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur eyes met. Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\r\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was in this particular little bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHydro-chloride of strychnine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, over his shoulder, continuing\r\nto hum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\r\nexpected that answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little\xe2\x80\x94only\r\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\r\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\r\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you manage to take this photograph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dropped my hat from the balcony,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Poirot simply. \xe2\x80\x9cVisitors\r\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\r\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s colleague had to go down and fetch it\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you knew what you were going to find?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\r\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\r\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\r\nimportant discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cBut one thing does strike me. No doubt\r\nit has struck you too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\r\nThis is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\r\nMrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\r\ncounter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\r\nhandled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\r\ndo not like confusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\r\nstuck his head in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\r\nwas standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been visiting an old woman in the village,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\r\ncall for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had come to honour me with\r\na visit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will some day, if you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d she promised him, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nstarted ever so slightly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cremember, Papa Poirot is always at your\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\r\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnchanted, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\r\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\r\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\r\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\r\nsome great giant sighing.\r\n\r\nWe walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\r\ncame to us that something was wrong.\r\n\r\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\r\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\r\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, m\xe2\x80\x99am! Oh, m\xe2\x80\x99am! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Dorcas?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cTell us at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s those wicked detectives. They\xe2\x80\x99ve arrested him\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ve arrested\r\nMr. Cavendish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrested Lawrence?\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped.\r\n\r\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcas\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence\xe2\x80\x94Mr. John.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\r\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION\r\n\r\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\r\ntwo months later.\r\n\r\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\r\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\r\npassionately on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s side, scorning the mere idea of his\r\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\r\n\r\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\r\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\r\njealousy have\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJealousy?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\r\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\r\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\r\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\r\nspeak. With his tenderness for \xe2\x80\x9ca woman\xe2\x80\x99s happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d I felt glad that\r\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven now,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\r\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut John! My old friend John!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery murderer is probably somebody\xe2\x80\x99s old friend,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Poirot\r\nphilosophically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot mix up sentiment and reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say I think you might have given me a hint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\r\non to John what I believed to be Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s views concerning Bauerstein.\r\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\r\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\r\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\r\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\r\n\r\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\r\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\r\nlikely to be acquitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Poirot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\r\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\r\nmatter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\r\nevidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\r\nlack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\r\nlink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you first suspect John Cavendish?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after a minute or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not suspect him at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\r\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\r\nat the inquest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\r\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife\xe2\x80\x94and you remember,\r\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest\xe2\x80\x94it must be either Lawrence or\r\nJohn. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was just as\r\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\r\nwas explained quite naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, a light breaking in upon me, \xe2\x80\x9cit was John who quarrelled\r\nwith his mother that afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have known this all along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Mrs. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour could only be explained that\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you say he may be acquitted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\r\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\r\nadvise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\r\ntrial. And\xe2\x80\x94ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\r\nfriend. I must not appear in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\r\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\r\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, that\xe2\x80\x99s playing it a bit low down,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\r\nand we must use any means in our power\xe2\x80\x94otherwise he will slip through\r\nour fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\r\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\r\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsmiled broadly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit will probably be as a witness for the defence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could hardly believe my ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite _en r\xc3\xa8gle_,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cStrangely enough, I can\r\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\r\ndid not destroy that will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\r\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\r\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\r\nduly committed for trial.\r\n\r\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\r\nPoirot being included in the family party.\r\n\r\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\r\nthem continually.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirot\xe2\x80\x99s nerves grew worse and\r\nworse. That \xe2\x80\x9clast link\xe2\x80\x9d he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\r\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\r\nif John were not acquitted?\r\n\r\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\r\nBailey, charged with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\npleaded \xe2\x80\x9cNot Guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\r\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\r\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\r\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\r\nlived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\r\nattention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\r\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\r\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\r\nneighbouring farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife. This having come to his stepmother\xe2\x80\x99s ears,\r\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\r\nensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\r\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop, wearing a\r\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\r\nanother man\xe2\x80\x94to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s husband, of whom he had been\r\nbitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\r\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\r\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\r\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\r\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\r\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\r\nbefore her marriage, but\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\r\nforefinger\xe2\x80\x94the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\r\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\r\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\r\nformer one; or\xe2\x80\x94this seemed to him more likely\xe2\x80\x94she may have had an idea\r\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\r\nconversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\r\nlegal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\r\nfavour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\r\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\r\nnight. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\r\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\r\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\r\nvalid.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\r\nroom, by Detective Inspector Japp\xe2\x80\x94a most brilliant officer\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\r\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\r\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.\r\n\r\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\r\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\r\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\r\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\r\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\r\ncross-examined.\r\n\r\nAlfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\r\nHe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\r\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\r\n\r\nThe gardeners\xe2\x80\x99 evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\r\nand then Dorcas was called.\r\n\r\nDorcas, faithful to her \xe2\x80\x9cyoung gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d denied strenuously that it\r\ncould have been John\xe2\x80\x99s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\r\nteeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\r\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\r\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\r\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\r\ndeny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\r\ngive evidence against her husband.\r\n\r\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\r\nLawrence Cavendish from Parkson\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorcas shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\r\nfrom home part of June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\r\nwould be done with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would either be put in his room or sent on after him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\r\nwho would attend to anything like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\r\nquestioned as to the parcel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can\xe2\x80\x99t remember one special one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\r\nor whether it was put in his room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\r\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\r\npaper?\xe2\x80\x9d He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\r\nin the morning-room at Styles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come to look for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you eventually discover it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the top of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94a wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn top of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I believe so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not find it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must know where you found it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was on the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn assistant from Parkson\xe2\x80\x99s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\r\nJune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\r\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\r\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\r\ntheir books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to \xe2\x80\x9cL. Cavendish,\r\nEsq., Styles Court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was the letter written from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Styles Court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same address to which you sent the parcel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the letter came from there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\r\npostmark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\r\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\r\npostmark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY\xe2\x80\x94es.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\r\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\r\nsignified that he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\r\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\r\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\r\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\r\nslight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\r\nhad seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\r\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\r\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\r\n\r\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\r\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\r\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\r\n\r\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\r\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said consolingly, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be the other way about to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nHastings, you do not think\xe2\x80\x94surely it could not have been Lawrence\xe2\x80\x94Oh,\r\nno, that could not be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\r\nasked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot appreciatively. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a clever man, that Sir\r\nErnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he believes Lawrence guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\r\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\r\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\r\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\r\nagainst John\xe2\x80\x94and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\r\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\r\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cActing on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\r\nsearched the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s room, during his temporary absence from the\r\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\r\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\r\nMr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94these were exhibited\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csecondly, this phial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, a\r\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\r\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: \xe2\x80\x9cStrychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\r\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\r\nhad been found in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s cheque book, and on being reversed\r\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: \xe2\x80\x9c. . . erything of which I die\r\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...\xe2\x80\x9d This placed\r\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\r\nthe deceased lady\xe2\x80\x99s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\r\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\r\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s cross-examination was yet to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat day was it when you searched the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTuesday, the 24th of July.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly a week after the tragedy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\r\ndrawer unlocked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\r\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\r\nto find?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might have stowed them there in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\r\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\r\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\r\nor light?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavyish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\r\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\r\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\r\nunderclothing. Yes, or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\r\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\r\nunaware of their presence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not think it likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\r\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\r\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Raikes\xe2\x80\x94poor Mary, that must have been bitter\r\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\r\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\r\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\r\n\r\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\r\nto Mr. Philips\xe2\x80\x99 questions, he denied having ordered anything from\r\nParkson\xe2\x80\x99s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\r\nWales.\r\n\r\nInstantly, Sir Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson\xe2\x80\x99s on June 29th?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\r\ninherit Styles Court?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s pale face.\r\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\r\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\r\n\r\nHeavywether cared nothing for his client\xe2\x80\x99s anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer my question, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawrence quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by you \xe2\x80\x98suppose\xe2\x80\x99? Your brother has no children. You\r\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Sir Ernest,\xe2\x80\x9d protested the judge, \xe2\x80\x9cthese questions are not\r\nrelevant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\r\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you\xe2\x80\x94while you happened to be alone for a few seconds\xe2\x80\x94unlock the\r\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94may have done so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put it to you that you did do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you examine one bottle in particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\r\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94o\xe2\x80\x94I am sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\r\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you take it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! So poisons \xe2\x80\x98naturally interest\xe2\x80\x99 you, do they? Still, you waited to\r\nbe alone before gratifying that \xe2\x80\x98interest\xe2\x80\x99 of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\r\njust the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, as it happens, the others were not there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\r\nof minutes, and it happened\xe2\x80\x94I say, it happened\xe2\x80\x94to be during those two\r\nminutes that you displayed your \xe2\x80\x98natural interest\xe2\x80\x99 in Hydro-chloride of\r\nStrychnine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\r\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\r\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\r\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\r\nupon for their opinion of the signature of \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\r\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\r\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\r\nit might be the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether\xe2\x80\x99s speech in opening the case for the defence was\r\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\r\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\r\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\r\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\r\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\r\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\r\nprisoner\xe2\x80\x99s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\r\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\r\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\r\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\r\nthe crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\r\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\r\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson\xe2\x80\x99s. The quarrel which\r\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\r\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nHis learned friend\xe2\x80\x94Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\r\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\r\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\r\nthe facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\r\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\r\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s head that\r\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\r\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\r\nquarrels.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\r\nentered the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\r\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\r\nMarston\xe2\x80\x99s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\r\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\r\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\r\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\r\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\r\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\r\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\r\nas evidence.\r\n\r\nAs for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\r\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\r\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\r\nrevoked by his stepmother\xe2\x80\x99s remarriage. He would call evidence to show\r\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\r\nquite a new view of the case.\r\n\r\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\r\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\r\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\r\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\r\n\r\nHe would now call the prisoner.\r\n\r\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\r\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\r\nThe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\r\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\r\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether\xe2\x80\x99s insinuations against my brother. My\r\nbrother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\r\n\r\nThen the cross-examination began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\r\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\r\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\r\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\r\nnot really the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\r\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94fragments which you must have recognized?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not recognize them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour memory must be unusually short!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\r\npaid very little attention to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s actual words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Philips\xe2\x80\x99 incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\r\npassed on to the subject of the note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\r\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\r\nhand-writing\xe2\x80\x94carelessly disguised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\r\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\r\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\r\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\r\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, with\r\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there\xe2\x80\x94and signed the\r\nregister in his name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is absolutely untrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\r\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\r\njury,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\r\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\r\nperjury.\r\n\r\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\r\n\r\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\r\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Poirot?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\r\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary\xe2\x80\x99s offer of\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\r\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\r\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\r\n\r\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\r\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\r\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\r\nneeded that more than now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\r\nup edifice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\r\nhigh, but I cannot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thump\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thump\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c that last link of which I\r\nspoke to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\r\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done\xe2\x80\x94so! By placing\xe2\x80\x94one card\xe2\x80\x94on another\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nmathematical\xe2\x80\x94precision!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\r\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a steady hand you\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen\r\nyour hand shake once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Poirot,\r\nwith great placidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\r\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\r\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\r\nmust say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\r\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\r\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\r\nkeenest agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Poirot!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Are you taken\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\xe2\x80\x94it is\xe2\x80\x94that I have an idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, much relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of your \xe2\x80\x98little ideas\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _ma foi_, no!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis time it is an idea\r\ngigantic! Stupendous! And you\xe2\x80\x94_you_, my friend, have given it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\r\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x98A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\r\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\r\ngesture of despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\r\nround the corner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can be the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\r\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cI expect he will be back before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. THE LAST LINK\r\n\r\nPoirot\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\r\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock a\r\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\r\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\r\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\r\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, I have your permission to hold a little _r\xc3\xa9union_ in the\r\n_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too amiable, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\r\nforward chairs as he did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard\xe2\x80\x94here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\r\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\r\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that man comes into the house, I leave it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\r\n\r\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\r\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\r\n\r\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\r\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\r\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\r\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\r\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\r\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\r\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\r\nbromide powders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\r\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\r\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\r\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\r\nrecognize it for what it was\xe2\x80\x94a piece torn from a green land armlet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land\xe2\x80\x94Mrs.\r\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\r\ndeceased\xe2\x80\x99s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that door was bolted on the inside!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\r\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\r\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\r\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\r\nverifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\r\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\r\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\r\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\r\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\r\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s door. I myself, in company\r\nwith the police, went to the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s room, and whilst there I,\r\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\r\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\r\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\r\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\r\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\r\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s room when the\r\nalarm was given.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\r\nmother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\r\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\r\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\r\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\r\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\r\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nclosing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\r\nservants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\r\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\r\nWhat can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\r\ntrooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\r\narrived with the rest, but\xe2\x80\x94and this is significant\xe2\x80\x94I can find no one\r\nwho saw her come from the other wing.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Mary Cavendish. \xe2\x80\x9cAm\r\nI right, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\r\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\r\nBut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\r\ninnocence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\r\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\r\nsignificance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe will!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lawrence. \xe2\x80\x9cThen it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\r\nwill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one person who could possibly\r\nhave destroyed that will\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Inglethorp herself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had only made it out that very\r\nafternoon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\r\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\r\nthe year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\r\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\r\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\r\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\r\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\r\nwas thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\r\ndocument such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\r\nMrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\r\ndestroy some important document\xe2\x80\x94possibly a will. So the discovery of\r\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\r\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\r\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\r\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\r\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\r\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\r\nI faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Dorcas\r\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: \xe2\x80\x98You need not think that any\r\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\r\naddressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\r\nstandpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to\r\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.\xe2\x80\x99 At four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\r\nwas convinced was correct. The second \xe2\x80\x98scandal\xe2\x80\x99 she spoke of was not\r\nthe same as the first\xe2\x80\x94and it concerned herself!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us reconstruct. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\r\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife\xe2\x80\x94who, by the way,\r\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\r\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\r\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\r\nagitation, with a slip of paper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98a letter,\xe2\x80\x99 Dorcas thinks\xe2\x80\x94in her hand,\r\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\r\nPresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, something has\r\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\r\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\r\nthat something?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\r\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\r\nof sentiment?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\r\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\r\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\r\nstood her husband\xe2\x80\x99s desk\xe2\x80\x94locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\r\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\r\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\r\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else\xe2\x80\x94that slip of\r\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\r\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\r\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\r\nwas a written proof of her own husband\xe2\x80\x99s infidelity. She demanded it\r\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\r\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\r\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\r\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\r\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\r\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\r\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s despatch-case, which had been lost\r\nthat morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\r\nimportant papers in this particular case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\r\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\r\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\nPossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\r\nquite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\r\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\r\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\r\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you were drugged, mademoiselle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrugged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mais, oui!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he addressed us collectively again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat through all the\r\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of\r\ntwo possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned\xe2\x80\x94which I did not\r\nbelieve\xe2\x80\x94or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\r\ncarefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\r\neach cup, and had them analysed\xe2\x80\x94with no result. I had counted the cups\r\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\r\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\r\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\r\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\r\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\r\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\r\nseven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\r\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\r\nusual\xe2\x80\x94or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\r\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\r\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\r\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\r\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\r\n\xe2\x80\x98salt\xe2\x80\x99 on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\r\nsent it to be analysed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawrence\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\r\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\r\nnarcotic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a narcotic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Here is the analyst\xe2\x80\x99s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\r\nbut effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d\xe2\x80\x99heure_ in\r\nconsequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\r\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word \xe2\x80\x98Poison\xe2\x80\x99!\r\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\r\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\r\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s death lay at her door. She\r\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\r\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\r\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\r\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\r\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\r\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\r\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\r\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\r\nI understand now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\r\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see everything now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawrence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe drugged cocoa, taken on top\r\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\r\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d The cry of surprise was universal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\r\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\r\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\r\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\r\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\r\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In\r\nexactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\r\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\r\nplayed her the same trick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\r\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\r\ntable by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\r\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\r\nwith a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\r\ncoffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\r\nbetween seven and nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening. What third medium was\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\r\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?\xe2\x80\x9d Poirot looked round the\r\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. \xe2\x80\x9cHer medicine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\r\ntonic?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no need to introduce it. It was already there\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\r\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\r\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\r\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The following prescription has become famous in text books:\r\n\r\n\r\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\r\n\r\n          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\r\n\r\n          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\r\n\r\n          Fiat Mistura\r\n\r\n\r\n_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\r\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\r\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\r\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\r\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins\xe2\x80\x99 prescription, but\r\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\r\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\r\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\r\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\r\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s medicine was always\r\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\r\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThroughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\r\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\r\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\r\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\r\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\r\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\r\nhome, so that the last\xe2\x80\x94and fatal\xe2\x80\x94dose was actually taken twenty-four\r\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\r\nto that delay that the final proof\xe2\x80\x94the last link of the chain\xe2\x80\x94is now in\r\nmy hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter in the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\r\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\r\nwarned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\r\nbut not the manner of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\r\nclearing his throat, read:\r\n\r\nDearest Evelyn:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right\xe2\x80\x94only it\r\n    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\r\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\r\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\r\n    circumspect. A false step\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\r\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\r\nknow this hand-writing and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou devil! How did you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\r\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Messieurs, mesdames_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, with a flourish, \xe2\x80\x9clet me\r\nintroduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. POIROT EXPLAINS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoirot, you old villain,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve half a mind to strangle you!\r\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\r\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\r\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\r\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\r\n\r\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\r\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that\xe2\x80\x94_enfin_, to\r\nconceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\r\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\r\nwould have\xe2\x80\x94in your so expressive idiom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98smelt a rat\xe2\x80\x99! And then,\r\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d besought Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cI implore you, do not enrage yourself!\r\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\r\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I grumbled, a little mollified. \xe2\x80\x9cI still think you might have\r\ngiven me a hint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\r\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\r\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\r\nacquitted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\r\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\r\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cit was not plain to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen again,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Poirot, \xe2\x80\x9cat the beginning, did I not repeat to\r\nyou several times that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\r\nThat should have conveyed something to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\r\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\r\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\r\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\r\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the ch\xc3\xa2teau, I realized at once\r\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\r\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\r\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s guilt were\r\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\r\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you change your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\r\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\r\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\r\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\r\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\r\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\r\nwas attracted by the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\r\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\r\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\r\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\r\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_\r\nfrom that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\r\narrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why he wished to be arrested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\r\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\r\nwas clever\xe2\x80\x94his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\r\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\r\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\r\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\r\nirreproachable alibi\xe2\x80\x94and, hey presto, he was safe for life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I still don\xe2\x80\x99t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\r\nthe chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\r\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Howard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\r\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\r\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\r\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\r\nThey are a clever pair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\r\ndone,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\r\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\r\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\r\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\r\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\r\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\r\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\r\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\r\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\r\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\r\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s large sized\r\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot\xe2\x80\x99s? The risk is practically\r\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\r\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\r\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\r\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\r\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\r\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\r\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\r\nclever\xe2\x80\x94and that was their undoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\r\nstrychnine at the village chemist\xe2\x80\x99s, and signing the register in his\r\nhand-writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\r\nMonday, therefore, at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\r\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\r\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\r\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\r\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, which she\r\nhad previously studied carefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\r\nhim an anonymous note\xe2\x80\x94still copying his hand-writing\xe2\x80\x94which takes him to\r\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\r\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\r\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\r\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\r\nCavendish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\r\nthat night. The broken bell, Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s absence\xe2\x80\x94arranged by Inglethorp\r\nthrough his wife\xe2\x80\x94all these are wasted. And then\xe2\x80\x94he makes his slip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\r\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\r\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\r\nCaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\r\ndesk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\r\nagain, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\r\nhe could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\r\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\r\nincriminating document.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\r\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\r\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\r\nher mind. She knows that she is in danger\xe2\x80\x94but is ignorant of where the\r\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\r\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\r\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\r\nmade. She keeps the fatal letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\r\nof the despatch-case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\r\nrealized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\r\nnothing to connect him with the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he destroy it at\r\nonce when he got hold of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he did not dare take the biggest risk of all\xe2\x80\x94that of keeping\r\nit on his own person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\r\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it\xe2\x80\x94the five\r\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\r\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\r\npassed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\r\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case\xe2\x80\x94it is locked, and\r\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\r\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\r\nhoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\r\nof that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\r\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\r\non him. He may be seen leaving the room\xe2\x80\x94he may be searched. If the\r\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\r\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\r\nboudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\r\npaper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\r\nare sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\r\ndare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees\xe2\x80\x94what do you think, _mon\r\nami?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\r\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\r\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one would think of looking there,\xe2\x80\x9d Poirot continued. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he will\r\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\r\nof evidence against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom, under our very noses?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend. That is where I discovered my \xe2\x80\x98last link,\xe2\x80\x99 and I owe\r\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\r\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\r\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\r\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\r\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\r\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cso that is the explanation of your\r\nextraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it was a race for time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I still can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\r\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\r\nconfidence on the subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\r\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\r\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\r\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\r\nprevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\r\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\r\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\r\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\r\nthe document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\r\nit in the spill vase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper\xe2\x80\x99s existence. In\r\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\r\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\r\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\r\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\r\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\r\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\r\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\r\nthey would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\r\nhave been able to bring him to justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\r\nHoward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\r\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what was there to lie about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94more or less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\r\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\r\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98July 17th\xe2\x80\x99 is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\r\nthe 7th\xe2\x80\x94the day after Miss Howard\xe2\x80\x99s departure? The \xe2\x80\x981\xe2\x80\x99 was written in\r\nbefore the \xe2\x80\x987\xe2\x80\x99 to turn it into the \xe2\x80\x9817th\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\r\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\r\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\r\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\r\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cafter that, you gave me two reasons\r\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd very good reasons too,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a long time they were\r\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\r\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\r\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\r\ndebar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\r\nover-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\r\nThere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\r\ncame to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\r\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\r\ncleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would\r\nprobably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\r\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\r\nvery different _d\xc3\xa9nouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\r\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\r\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\r\nstrychnine and glasses in John\xe2\x80\x99s room. She puts the beard in the attic.\r\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nremarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\r\nhome to Lawrence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\r\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\r\nthe pair of schemers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis manner was unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\r\nthe crime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\r\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\r\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\r\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\r\nevidence against her than anyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are joking, Poirot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\r\nfirst entered his mother\xe2\x80\x99s room on the fatal night? It was because,\r\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\r\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s room was unbolted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he declared that he saw it bolted!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was just what confirmed my\r\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should he shield her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he is in love with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\r\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that, _mon ami?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCynthia herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said that she did not mind at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she certainly did mind very much,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\nlike that\xe2\x80\x94_les femmes!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\r\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\r\nbrother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\r\nwas in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother\xe2\x80\x99s room, and\r\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\r\ndriven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\r\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\r\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\r\ncontents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\r\nthe theory of \xe2\x80\x98Death from natural causes\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about the \xe2\x80\x98extra coffee-cup\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\r\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\r\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\r\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\r\nAnd he was perfectly right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were, of course, an accusation against her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have explained\r\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\r\nwife are reconciled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean\xe2\x80\x94thanks to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\r\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\r\nloved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\r\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\r\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\r\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\r\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\r\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\r\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\r\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\r\nJohn Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\r\ndecision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I quite understood your distress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\r\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\r\nonce. I could have cleared him\xe2\x80\x94though it might have meant a failure to\r\nconvict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\r\nreal attitude up to the very last moment\xe2\x80\x94which partly accounts for my\r\nsuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\r\nbrought to trial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of \xe2\x80\x98a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness\xe2\x80\x99. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\r\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\r\nlittle man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\r\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poirot, smiling at me. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\r\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\r\ngreatest thing in all the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\r\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\r\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\r\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought him back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d He had stood aside, and as I\r\nwent out I had seen the look in Mary\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as John Cavendish had\r\ncaught his wife in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are right, Poirot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is the\r\ngreatest thing in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, springing up.\r\n\r\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94only wanted to tell you something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\r\nexclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cYou dears!\xe2\x80\x9d kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\r\nout of the room again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, surprised.\r\n\r\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\r\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\r\nher as much as she thought,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poirot philosophically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! Monsieur Lawrence,\xe2\x80\x9d called Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must congratulate you, is\r\nit not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\r\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\r\n\r\nI sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, _mon ami?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are two delightful women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd neither of them is for you?\xe2\x80\x9d finished Poirot. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. Console\r\nyourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Mysterious Affair at Styles, by Agatha Christie\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 863-0.txt or 863-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/6/863/\r\n\r\nProduced by Charles Keller\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
