    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. Mrs. Rachel Lynde is Surprised
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. Rachel Lynde
      lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow,
      fringed with alders and ladies&rsquo; eardrops and traversed by a brook that had
      its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was
      reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through
      those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it
      reached Lynde&rsquo;s Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for
      not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde&rsquo;s door without due
      regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel
      was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed,
      from brooks and children up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out
      of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and
      wherefores thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend
      closely to their neighbor&rsquo;s business by dint of neglecting their own; but
      Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their
      own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a notable
      housewife; her work was always done and well done; she &ldquo;ran&rdquo; the Sewing
      Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop of the
      Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all this Mrs.
      Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window,
      knitting &ldquo;cotton warp&rdquo; quilts&mdash;she had knitted sixteen of them, as
      Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices&mdash;and keeping a
      sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep
      red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula
      jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two sides of it,
      anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and
      so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s all-seeing eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in
      at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house
      was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of
      bees. Thomas Lynde&mdash;a meek little man whom Avonlea people called
      &ldquo;Rachel Lynde&rsquo;s husband&rdquo;&mdash;was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill
      field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his
      on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew
      that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening
      before in William J. Blair&rsquo;s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow
      his turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for
      Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about
      anything in his whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of
      a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he
      wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof
      that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy and the sorrel
      mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance. Now,
      where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this and
      that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions.
      But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing
      and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest man alive and hated to
      have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk.
      Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, was
      something that didn&rsquo;t happen often. Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she might,
      could make nothing of it and her afternoon&rsquo;s enjoyment was spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla
      where he&rsquo;s gone and why,&rdquo; the worthy woman finally concluded. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
      generally go to town this time of year and he <i>never</i> visits; if he&rsquo;d
      run out of turnip seed he wouldn&rsquo;t dress up and take the buggy to go for
      more; he wasn&rsquo;t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor. Yet
      something must have happened since last night to start him off. I&rsquo;m clean
      puzzled, that&rsquo;s what, and I won&rsquo;t know a minute&rsquo;s peace of mind or
      conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea
      today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the big,
      rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant
      quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde&rsquo;s Hollow. To be sure, the long
      lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert&rsquo;s father, as shy and
      silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly could from
      his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded
      his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared
      land and there it was to this day, barely visible from the main road along
      which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel
      Lynde did not call living in such a place <i>living</i> at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just <i>staying</i>, that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; she said as she stepped along the
      deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder
      Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by
      themselves. Trees aren&rsquo;t much company, though dear knows if they were
      there&rsquo;d be enough of them. I&rsquo;d ruther look at people. To be sure, they
      seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they&rsquo;re used to it. A body can
      get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green
      Gables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one
      side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.
      Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have
      seen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla
      Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could
      have eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial peck
      of dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden
      to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment&mdash;or
      would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give
      it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its windows looked
      east and west; through the west one, looking out on the back yard, came a
      flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one, whence you got a glimpse
      of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding, slender
      birches down in the hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of
      vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly
      distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible
      a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously; and here she
      sat now, knitting, and the table behind her was laid for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental
      note of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,
      so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but
      the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves
      and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any
      particular company. Yet what of Matthew&rsquo;s white collar and the sorrel
      mare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about
      quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Rachel,&rdquo; Marilla said briskly. &ldquo;This is a real fine
      evening, isn&rsquo;t it? Won&rsquo;t you sit down? How are all your folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship
      existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,
      in spite of&mdash;or perhaps because of&mdash;their dissimilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark
      hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little
      knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She
      looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she
      was; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had
      been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative of
      a sense of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all pretty well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel. &ldquo;I was kind of afraid <i>you</i>
      weren&rsquo;t, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe he
      was going to the doctor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla&rsquo;s lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs. Rachel up;
      she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably
      would be too much for her neighbor&rsquo;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Matthew went to Bright River. We&rsquo;re getting a little boy from an
      orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he&rsquo;s coming on the train tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a
      kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.
      She was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable that
      Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to
      suppose it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in earnest, Marilla?&rdquo; she demanded when voice returned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums in
      Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated
      Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought
      in exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people
      adopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly
      turning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!
      Nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth put such a notion into your head?&rdquo; she demanded
      disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be
      disapproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for some time&mdash;all winter in
      fact,&rdquo; returned Marilla. &ldquo;Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day
      before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the
      asylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.
      Spencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have
      talked it over off and on ever since. We thought we&rsquo;d get a boy. Matthew
      is getting up in years, you know&mdash;he&rsquo;s sixty&mdash;and he isn&rsquo;t so
      spry as he once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how
      desperate hard it&rsquo;s got to be to get hired help. There&rsquo;s never anybody to
      be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you
      do get one broke into your ways and taught something he&rsquo;s up and off to
      the lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a
      Home boy. But I said &lsquo;no&rsquo; flat to that. &lsquo;They may be all right&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      not saying they&rsquo;re not&mdash;but no London street Arabs for me,&rsquo; I said.
      &lsquo;Give me a native born at least. There&rsquo;ll be a risk, no matter who we get.
      But I&rsquo;ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a
      born Canadian.&rsquo; So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us
      out one when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she
      was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer&rsquo;s folks at Carmody to
      bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that would
      be the best age&mdash;old enough to be of some use in doing chores right
      off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him a good
      home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today&mdash;the
      mail-man brought it from the station&mdash;saying they were coming on the
      five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to meet him.
      Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to White Sands
      station herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to
      speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Marilla, I&rsquo;ll just tell you plain that I think you&rsquo;re doing a
      mighty foolish thing&mdash;a risky thing, that&rsquo;s what. You don&rsquo;t know what
      you&rsquo;re getting. You&rsquo;re bringing a strange child into your house and home
      and you don&rsquo;t know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is
      like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he&rsquo;s likely to turn out. Why,
      it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up west
      of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the
      house at night&mdash;set it <i>on purpose</i>, Marilla&mdash;and nearly
      burnt them to a crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an
      adopted boy used to suck the eggs&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t break him of it. If
      you had asked my advice in the matter&mdash;which you didn&rsquo;t do, Marilla&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      have said for mercy&rsquo;s sake not to think of such a thing, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Job&rsquo;s comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She
      knitted steadily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny there&rsquo;s something in what you say, Rachel. I&rsquo;ve had some
      qualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could see that, so I
      gave in. It&rsquo;s so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he
      does I always feel it&rsquo;s my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there&rsquo;s
      risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There&rsquo;s risks
      in people&rsquo;s having children of their own if it comes to that&mdash;they
      don&rsquo;t always turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the
      Island. It isn&rsquo;t as if we were getting him from England or the States. He
      can&rsquo;t be much different from ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope it will turn out all right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel in a tone that
      plainly indicated her painful doubts. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you if
      he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well&mdash;I heard of
      a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the
      whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl in that
      instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not getting a girl,&rdquo; said Marilla, as if poisoning wells were
      a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a
      boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I wonder at Mrs.
      Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, <i>she</i> wouldn&rsquo;t shrink from
      adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his
      imported orphan. But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least
      before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert Bell&rsquo;s and
      tell the news. It would certainly make a sensation second to none, and
      Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. So she took herself away,
      somewhat to Marilla&rsquo;s relief, for the latter felt her doubts and fears
      reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s pessimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all things that ever were or will be!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Rachel
      when she was safely out in the lane. &ldquo;It does really seem as if I must be
      dreaming. Well, I&rsquo;m sorry for that poor young one and no mistake. Matthew
      and Marilla don&rsquo;t know anything about children and they&rsquo;ll expect him to
      be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather, if so be&rsquo;s he ever had a
      grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think of a child at
      Green Gables somehow; there&rsquo;s never been one there, for Matthew and
      Marilla were grown up when the new house was built&mdash;if they ever <i>were</i>
      children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them. I wouldn&rsquo;t be
      in that orphan&rsquo;s shoes for anything. My, but I pity him, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her
      heart; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at
      the Bright River station at that very moment her pity would have been
      still deeper and more profound.

      CHAPTER II. Matthew Cuthbert is surprised
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ATTHEW Cuthbert
      and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to Bright
      River. It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with
      now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where
      wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. The air was sweet with the breath
      of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to
      horizon mists of pearl and purple; while
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The little birds sang as if it were
     The one day of summer in all the year.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion, except during the moments
      when he met women and had to nod to them&mdash;for in Prince Edward island
      you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you
      know them or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he had an
      uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing
      at him. He may have been quite right in thinking so, for he was an
      odd-looking personage, with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray hair
      that touched his stooping shoulders, and a full, soft brown beard which he
      had worn ever since he was twenty. In fact, he had looked at twenty very
      much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached Bright River there was no sign of any train; he thought he
      was too early, so he tied his horse in the yard of the small Bright River
      hotel and went over to the station house. The long platform was almost
      deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting
      on a pile of shingles at the extreme end. Matthew, barely noting that it
      <i>was</i> a girl, sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking
      at her. Had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense
      rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression. She was sitting
      there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was
      the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and
      main.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office
      preparatory to going home for supper, and asked him if the five-thirty
      train would soon be along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago,&rdquo; answered
      that brisk official. &ldquo;But there was a passenger dropped off for you&mdash;a
      little girl. She&rsquo;s sitting out there on the shingles. I asked her to go
      into the ladies&rsquo; waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she
      preferred to stay outside. &lsquo;There was more scope for imagination,&rsquo; she
      said. She&rsquo;s a case, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expecting a girl,&rdquo; said Matthew blankly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy I&rsquo;ve come
      for. He should be here. Mrs. Alexander Spencer was to bring him over from
      Nova Scotia for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stationmaster whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s some mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Spencer came off the train
      with that girl and gave her into my charge. Said you and your sister were
      adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her
      presently. That&rsquo;s all I know about it&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t got any more
      orphans concealed hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Matthew helplessly, wishing that Marilla was at
      hand to cope with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better question the girl,&rdquo; said the station-master
      carelessly. &ldquo;I dare say she&rsquo;ll be able to explain&mdash;she&rsquo;s got a tongue
      of her own, that&rsquo;s certain. Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you
      wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate Matthew was
      left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den&mdash;walk
      up to a girl&mdash;a strange girl&mdash;an orphan girl&mdash;and demand of
      her why she wasn&rsquo;t a boy. Matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and
      shuffled gently down the platform towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her
      eyes on him now. Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen
      what she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would
      have seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very
      tight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown
      sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids
      of very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin,
      also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked
      green in some lights and moods and gray in others.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen
      that the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes were full
      of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped and expressive;
      that the forehead was broad and full; in short, our discerning
      extraordinary observer might have concluded that no commonplace soul
      inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom shy Matthew Cuthbert
      was so ludicrously afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon as
      she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with one
      thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag; the
      other she held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?&rdquo; she said in a
      peculiarly clear, sweet voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you. I was beginning
      to be afraid you weren&rsquo;t coming for me and I was imagining all the things
      that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up my mind that if you
      didn&rsquo;t come for me to-night I&rsquo;d go down the track to that big wild
      cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild
      cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don&rsquo;t you think? You
      could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn&rsquo;t you? And I was
      quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn&rsquo;t to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and there
      he decided what to do. He could not tell this child with the glowing eyes
      that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and let Marilla do
      that. She couldn&rsquo;t be left at Bright River anyhow, no matter what mistake
      had been made, so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred
      until he was safely back at Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was late,&rdquo; he said shyly. &ldquo;Come along. The horse is over in
      the yard. Give me your bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can carry it,&rdquo; the child responded cheerfully. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t heavy.
      I&rsquo;ve got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn&rsquo;t heavy. And if it isn&rsquo;t
      carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out&mdash;so I&rsquo;d better
      keep it because I know the exact knack of it. It&rsquo;s an extremely old
      carpet-bag. Oh, I&rsquo;m very glad you&rsquo;ve come, even if it would have been nice
      to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We&rsquo;ve got to drive a long piece, haven&rsquo;t
      we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I&rsquo;m glad because I love driving.
      Oh, it seems so wonderful that I&rsquo;m going to live with you and belong to
      you. I&rsquo;ve never belonged to anybody&mdash;not really. But the asylum was
      the worst. I&rsquo;ve only been in it four months, but that was enough. I don&rsquo;t
      suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can&rsquo;t possibly
      understand what it is like. It&rsquo;s worse than anything you could imagine.
      Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that, but I didn&rsquo;t mean
      to be wicked. It&rsquo;s so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isn&rsquo;t it? They
      were good, you know&mdash;the asylum people. But there is so little scope
      for the imagination in an asylum&mdash;only just in the other orphans. It
      was pretty interesting to imagine things about them&mdash;to imagine that
      perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted
      earl, who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel
      nurse who died before she could confess. I used to lie awake at nights and
      imagine things like that, because I didn&rsquo;t have time in the day. I guess
      that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so thin&mdash;I <i>am</i> dreadful thin, ain&rsquo;t I? There
      isn&rsquo;t a pick on my bones. I do love to imagine I&rsquo;m nice and plump, with
      dimples in my elbows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Matthew&rsquo;s companion stopped talking, partly because she was out
      of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another word
      did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep
      little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft
      soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees and slim
      white birches, were several feet above their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that
      brushed against the side of the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank, all
      white and lacy, make you think of?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, a bride, of course&mdash;a bride all in white with a lovely misty
      veil. I&rsquo;ve never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I
      don&rsquo;t ever expect to be a bride myself. I&rsquo;m so homely nobody will ever
      want to marry me&mdash;unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose
      a foreign missionary mightn&rsquo;t be very particular. But I do hope that some
      day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss.
      I just love pretty clothes. And I&rsquo;ve never had a pretty dress in my life
      that I can remember&mdash;but of course it&rsquo;s all the more to look forward
      to, isn&rsquo;t it? And then I can imagine that I&rsquo;m dressed gorgeously. This
      morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear
      this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know.
      A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to
      the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn&rsquo;t sell it, but I&rsquo;d
      rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn&rsquo;t you?
      When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and
      pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most
      beautiful pale blue silk dress&mdash;because when you <i>are</i> imagining
      you might as well imagine something worth while&mdash;and a big hat all
      flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I
      felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my
      might. I wasn&rsquo;t a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs.
      Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn&rsquo;t time to get sick,
      watching to see that I didn&rsquo;t fall overboard. She said she never saw the
      beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from being seasick it&rsquo;s
      a mercy I did prowl, isn&rsquo;t it? And I wanted to see everything that was to
      be seen on that boat, because I didn&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;d ever have another
      opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more cherry-trees all in bloom! This
      Island is the bloomiest place. I just love it already, and I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m
      going to live here. I&rsquo;ve always heard that Prince Edward Island was the
      prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here, but
      I never really expected I would. It&rsquo;s delightful when your imaginations
      come true, isn&rsquo;t it? But those red roads are so funny. When we got into
      the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked
      Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn&rsquo;t know and for
      pity&rsquo;s sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked
      her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find
      out about things if you don&rsquo;t ask questions? And what <i>does</i> make the
      roads red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn&rsquo;t it splendid
      to think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes me
      feel glad to be alive&mdash;it&rsquo;s such an interesting world. It wouldn&rsquo;t be
      half so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There&rsquo;d be
      no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too much?
      People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn&rsquo;t talk? If you
      say so I&rsquo;ll stop. I can <i>stop</i> when I make up my mind to it, although
      it&rsquo;s difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet
      folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking
      themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had
      never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad
      enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the way
      they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they
      expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a
      word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But this
      freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather
      difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental
      processes he thought that he &ldquo;kind of liked her chatter.&rdquo; So he said as
      shyly as usual:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together fine.
      It&rsquo;s such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children
      should be seen and not heard. I&rsquo;ve had that said to me a million times if
      I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big words. But if you
      have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, that seems reasonable,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was named Green
      Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were trees all around
      it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And there weren&rsquo;t any at
      all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny things out in front with
      little whitewashed cagey things about them. They just looked like orphans
      themselves, those trees did. It used to make me want to cry to look at
      them. I used to say to them, &lsquo;Oh, you <i>poor</i> little things! If you
      were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little
      mosses and June bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and
      birds singing in you branches, you could grow, couldn&rsquo;t you? But you can&rsquo;t
      where you are. I know just exactly how you feel, little trees.&rsquo; I felt
      sorry to leave them behind this morning. You do get so attached to things
      like that, don&rsquo;t you? Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I
      forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, yes, there&rsquo;s one right below the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy. It&rsquo;s always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I never
      expected I would, though. Dreams don&rsquo;t often come true, do they? Wouldn&rsquo;t
      it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy.
      I can&rsquo;t feel exactly perfectly happy because&mdash;well, what color would
      you call this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and held
      it up before Matthew&rsquo;s eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on the tints
      of ladies&rsquo; tresses, but in this case there couldn&rsquo;t be much doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s red, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her
      very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s red,&rdquo; she said resignedly. &ldquo;Now you see why I can&rsquo;t be
      perfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don&rsquo;t mind the other
      things so much&mdash;the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I
      can imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf
      complexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I <i>cannot</i> imagine that
      red hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, &lsquo;Now my hair is a glorious
      black, black as the raven&rsquo;s wing.&rsquo; But all the time I <i>know</i> it is
      just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow. I
      read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn&rsquo;t red
      hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow. What
      is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Matthew, who was getting a little
      dizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy had
      enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was
      divinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be
      divinely beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, no, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; confessed Matthew ingenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the choice&mdash;divinely
      beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn&rsquo;t make much real
      difference for it isn&rsquo;t likely I&rsquo;ll ever be either. It&rsquo;s certain I&rsquo;ll
      never be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says&mdash;oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh,
      Mr. Cuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled out
      of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had simply
      rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the &ldquo;Avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Avenue,&rdquo; so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road
      four or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,
      wide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old farmer.
      Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the boughs the
      air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted
      sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the buggy,
      her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to the
      white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving down
      the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with rapt face
      she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw visions trooping
      splendidly across that glowing background. Through Newbridge, a bustling
      little village where dogs barked at them and small boys hooted and curious
      faces peered from the windows, they drove, still in silence. When three
      more miles had dropped away behind them the child had not spoken. She
      could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically as she could talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re feeling pretty tired and hungry,&rdquo; Matthew ventured to say
      at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the only
      reason he could think of. &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t very far to go now&mdash;only
      another mile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the
      dreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that place we came through&mdash;that
      white place&mdash;what was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, you must mean the Avenue,&rdquo; said Matthew after a few moments&rsquo; 
      profound reflection. &ldquo;It is a kind of pretty place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty? Oh, <i>pretty</i> doesn&rsquo;t seem the right word to use. Nor
      beautiful, either. They don&rsquo;t go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful&mdash;wonderful.
      It&rsquo;s the first thing I ever saw that couldn&rsquo;t be improved upon by
      imagination. It just satisfies me here&rdquo;&mdash;she put one hand on her
      breast&mdash;&ldquo;it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache.
      Did you ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I just can&rsquo;t recollect that I ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it lots of time&mdash;whenever I see anything royally beautiful.
      But they shouldn&rsquo;t call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning
      in a name like that. They should call it&mdash;let me see&mdash;the White
      Way of Delight. Isn&rsquo;t that a nice imaginative name? When I don&rsquo;t like the
      name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of
      them so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins,
      but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that
      place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.
      Have we really only another mile to go before we get home? I&rsquo;m glad and
      I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I&rsquo;m
      always sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may come
      after, but you can never be sure. And it&rsquo;s so often the case that it isn&rsquo;t
      pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I&rsquo;m glad to think of
      getting home. You see, I&rsquo;ve never had a real home since I can remember. It
      gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really
      truly home. Oh, isn&rsquo;t that pretty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking
      almost like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it midway
      and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of sand-hills
      shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a glory of many
      shifting hues&mdash;the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and
      ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever
      been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir
      and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering shadows. Here
      and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl
      tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the head of the pond
      came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs. There was a little
      gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and,
      although it was not yet quite dark, a light was shining from one of its
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Barry&rsquo;s pond,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t like that name, either. I shall call it&mdash;let me see&mdash;the
      Lake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I know because
      of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a
      thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew ruminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white
      grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you
      think it can? There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much connection between grubs and
      lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it
      Barry&rsquo;s pond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard Slope&rsquo;s
      the name of his place. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that big bush behind it you could
      see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the bridge and round by
      the road, so it&rsquo;s near half a mile further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Barry any little girls? Well, not so very little either&mdash;about
      my size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got one about eleven. Her name is Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; with a long indrawing of breath. &ldquo;What a perfectly lovely name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno. There&rsquo;s something dreadful heathenish about it, seems
      to me. I&rsquo;d ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that. But when
      Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him
      the naming of her and he called her Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,
      then. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I&rsquo;m going to shut my eyes tight. I&rsquo;m
      always afraid going over bridges. I can&rsquo;t help imagining that perhaps just
      as we get to the middle, they&rsquo;ll crumple up like a jack-knife and nip us.
      So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them for all when I think
      we&rsquo;re getting near the middle. Because, you see, if the bridge <i>did</i>
      crumple up I&rsquo;d want to <i>see</i> it crumple. What a jolly rumble it
      makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn&rsquo;t it splendid there are so
      many things to like in this world? There we&rsquo;re over. Now I&rsquo;ll look back.
      Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say good night to the
      things I love, just as I would to people. I think they like it. That water
      looks as if it was smiling at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pretty near home now. That&rsquo;s Green Gables over&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his
      partially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his
      gesture. &ldquo;Let me guess. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll guess right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a
      hill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still clear
      in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose up against
      a marigold sky. Below was a little valley and beyond a long, gently-rising
      slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one to another the
      child&rsquo;s eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they lingered on one away
      to the left, far back from the road, dimly white with blossoming trees in
      the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it, in the stainless southwest
      sky, a great crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and
      promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew slapped the reins on the sorrel&rsquo;s back delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, you&rsquo;ve guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it so&rsquo;s
      you could tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t&mdash;really she didn&rsquo;t. All she said might just as well
      have been about most of those other places. I hadn&rsquo;t any real idea what it
      looked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it seems
      as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and blue
      from the elbow up, for I&rsquo;ve pinched myself so many times today. Every
      little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I&rsquo;d be so
      afraid it was all a dream. Then I&rsquo;d pinch myself to see if it was real&mdash;until
      suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only a dream I&rsquo;d better
      go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped pinching. But it <i>is</i>
      real and we&rsquo;re nearly home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred
      uneasily. He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would have
      to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was not to be
      hers after all. They drove over Lynde&rsquo;s Hollow, where it was already quite
      dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them from her window
      vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green Gables. By the
      time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from the approaching
      revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was not of Marilla or
      himself he was thinking of the trouble this mistake was probably going to
      make for them, but of the child&rsquo;s disappointment. When he thought of that
      rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had an uncomfortable feeling that
      he was going to assist at murdering something&mdash;much the same feeling
      that came over him when he had to kill a lamb or calf or any other
      innocent little creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were
      rustling silkily all round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,&rdquo; she whispered, as he lifted
      her to the ground. &ldquo;What nice dreams they must have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained &ldquo;all her worldly
      goods,&rdquo; she followed him into the house.

      CHAPTER III. Marilla Cuthbert is Surprised
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA came
      briskly forward as Matthew opened the door. But when her eyes fell on the
      odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the long braids of red
      hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Where is the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any boy,&rdquo; said Matthew wretchedly. &ldquo;There was only <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No boy! But there <i>must</i> have been a boy,&rdquo; insisted Marilla. &ldquo;We
      sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t. She brought <i>her</i>. I asked the station-master. And
      I had to bring her home. She couldn&rsquo;t be left there, no matter where the
      mistake had come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is a pretty piece of business!&rdquo; ejaculated Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from
      one to the other, all the animation fading out of her face. Suddenly she
      seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said. Dropping her
      precious carpet-bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me because I&rsquo;m not a boy!
      I might have expected it. Nobody ever did want me. I might have known it
      was all too beautiful to last. I might have known nobody really did want
      me. Oh, what shall I do? I&rsquo;m going to burst into tears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burst into tears she did. Sitting down on a chair by the table, flinging
      her arms out upon it, and burying her face in them, she proceeded to cry
      stormily. Marilla and Matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across
      the stove. Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally Marilla stepped
      lamely into the breach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, there&rsquo;s no need to cry so about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there <i>is</i> need!&rdquo; The child raised her head quickly, revealing
      a tear-stained face and trembling lips. &ldquo;<i>You</i> would cry, too, if you
      were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home
      and found that they didn&rsquo;t want you because you weren&rsquo;t a boy. Oh, this is
      the most <i>tragical</i> thing that ever happened to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse, mellowed
      Marilla&rsquo;s grim expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t cry any more. We&rsquo;re not going to turn you out-of-doors
      to-night. You&rsquo;ll have to stay here until we investigate this affair.
      What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please call me Cordelia?&rdquo; she said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Call</i> you Cordelia? Is that your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o-o, it&rsquo;s not exactly my name, but I would love to be called Cordelia.
      It&rsquo;s such a perfectly elegant name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what on earth you mean. If Cordelia isn&rsquo;t your name, what
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley,&rdquo; reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name, &ldquo;but,
      oh, please do call me Cordelia. It can&rsquo;t matter much to you what you call
      me if I&rsquo;m only going to be here a little while, can it? And Anne is such
      an unromantic name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unromantic fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said the unsympathetic Marilla. &ldquo;Anne is a real
      good plain sensible name. You&rsquo;ve no need to be ashamed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not ashamed of it,&rdquo; explained Anne, &ldquo;only I like Cordelia better.
      I&rsquo;ve always imagined that my name was Cordelia&mdash;at least, I always
      have of late years. When I was young I used to imagine it was Geraldine,
      but I like Cordelia better now. But if you call me Anne please call me
      Anne spelled with an E.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does it make how it&rsquo;s spelled?&rdquo; asked Marilla with
      another rusty smile as she picked up the teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it makes <i>such</i> a difference. It <i>looks</i> so much nicer.
      When you hear a name pronounced can&rsquo;t you always see it in your mind, just
      as if it was printed out? I can; and A-n-n looks dreadful, but A-n-n-e
      looks so much more distinguished. If you&rsquo;ll only call me Anne spelled with
      an E I shall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this mistake
      came to be made? We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy. Were
      there no boys at the asylum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there was an abundance of them. But Mrs. Spencer said <i>distinctly</i>
      that you wanted a girl about eleven years old. And the matron said she
      thought I would do. You don&rsquo;t know how delighted I was. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep
      all last night for joy. Oh,&rdquo; she added reproachfully, turning to Matthew,
      &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you tell me at the station that you didn&rsquo;t want me and leave
      me there? If I hadn&rsquo;t seen the White Way of Delight and the Lake of
      Shining Waters it wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth does she mean?&rdquo; demanded Marilla, staring at Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s just referring to some conversation we had on the road,&rdquo;
       said Matthew hastily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to put the mare in, Marilla. Have tea
      ready when I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you?&rdquo; continued Marilla when
      Matthew had gone out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She brought Lily Jones for herself. Lily is only five years old and she
      is very beautiful and had nut-brown hair. If I was very beautiful and had
      nut-brown hair would you keep me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of no use
      to us. Take off your hat. I&rsquo;ll lay it and your bag on the hall table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne took off her hat meekly. Matthew came back presently and they sat
      down to supper. But Anne could not eat. In vain she nibbled at the bread
      and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little
      scalloped glass dish by her plate. She did not really make any headway at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not eating anything,&rdquo; said Marilla sharply, eying her as if it
      were a serious shortcoming. Anne sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you are in the
      depths of despair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in the depths of despair, so I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; responded
      Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you? Well, did you ever try to <i>imagine</i> you were in the
      depths of despair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t think you can understand what it&rsquo;s like. It&rsquo;s a very
      uncomfortable feeling indeed. When you try to eat a lump comes right up in
      your throat and you can&rsquo;t swallow anything, not even if it was a chocolate
      caramel. I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply
      delicious. I&rsquo;ve often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate
      caramels, but I always wake up just when I&rsquo;m going to eat them. I do hope
      you won&rsquo;t be offended because I can&rsquo;t eat. Everything is extremely nice,
      but still I cannot eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s tired,&rdquo; said Matthew, who hadn&rsquo;t spoken since his return
      from the barn. &ldquo;Best put her to bed, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla had been wondering where Anne should be put to bed. She had
      prepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy.
      But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the thing to
      put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the question for
      such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable room. Marilla
      lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne spiritlessly did,
      taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as she passed. The hall
      was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in which she presently
      found herself seemed still cleaner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and turned
      down the bedclothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have a nightgown?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They&rsquo;re
      fearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so
      things are always skimpy&mdash;at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate
      skimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as in lovely
      trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that&rsquo;s one consolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I&rsquo;ll come back in a few
      minutes for the candle. I daren&rsquo;t trust you to put it out yourself. You&rsquo;d
      likely set the place on fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed
      walls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache
      over their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round
      braided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In one
      corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark, low-turned
      posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner table adorned
      with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the point of the
      most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight mirror. Midway
      between table and bed was the window, with an icy white muslin frill over
      it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole apartment was of a
      rigidity not to be described in words, but which sent a shiver to the very
      marrow of Anne&rsquo;s bones. With a sob she hastily discarded her garments, put
      on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where she burrowed face
      downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her head. When
      Marilla came up for the light various skimpy articles of raiment scattered
      most untidily over the floor and a certain tempestuous appearance of the
      bed were the only indications of any presence save her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She deliberately picked up Anne&rsquo;s clothes, placed them neatly on a prim
      yellow chair, and then, taking up the candle, went over to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a
      startling suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you call it a <i>good</i> night when you know it must be the very
      worst night I&rsquo;ve ever had?&rdquo; she said reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she dived down into invisibility again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper
      dishes. Matthew was smoking&mdash;a sure sign of perturbation of mind. He
      seldom smoked, for Marilla set her face against it as a filthy habit; but
      at certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and them Marilla winked
      at the practice, realizing that a mere man must have some vent for his
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is a pretty kettle of fish,&rdquo; she said wrathfully. &ldquo;This is
      what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. Richard Spencer&rsquo;s
      folks have twisted that message somehow. One of us will have to drive over
      and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow, that&rsquo;s certain. This girl will have to be
      sent back to the asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Matthew reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>suppose</i> so! Don&rsquo;t you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, she&rsquo;s a real nice little thing, Marilla. It&rsquo;s kind of a pity to
      send her back when she&rsquo;s so set on staying here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, you don&rsquo;t mean to say you think we ought to keep her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla&rsquo;s astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had
      expressed a predilection for standing on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, no, I suppose not&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; stammered Matthew,
      uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. &ldquo;I suppose&mdash;we
      could hardly be expected to keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not. What good would she be to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might be some good to her,&rdquo; said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you! I can see as
      plain as plain that you want to keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, she&rsquo;s a real interesting little thing,&rdquo; persisted Matthew. &ldquo;You
      should have heard her talk coming from the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she can talk fast enough. I saw that at once. It&rsquo;s nothing in her
      favour, either. I don&rsquo;t like children who have so much to say. I don&rsquo;t
      want an orphan girl and if I did she isn&rsquo;t the style I&rsquo;d pick out. There&rsquo;s
      something I don&rsquo;t understand about her. No, she&rsquo;s got to be despatched
      straight-way back to where she came from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could hire a French boy to help me,&rdquo; said Matthew, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;d be
      company for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suffering for company,&rdquo; said Marilla shortly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not going
      to keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, it&rsquo;s just as you say, of course, Marilla,&rdquo; said Matthew rising
      and putting his pipe away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To bed went Matthew. And to bed, when she had put her dishes away, went
      Marilla, frowning most resolutely. And up-stairs, in the east gable, a
      lonely, heart-hungry, friendless child cried herself to sleep.

      CHAPTER IV. Morning at Green Gables
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was broad
      daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the
      window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of
      which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she could not remember where she was. First came a delightful
      thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible remembrance. This was
      Green Gables and they didn&rsquo;t want her because she wasn&rsquo;t a boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside of
      her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor. She
      pushed up the sash&mdash;it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn&rsquo;t
      been opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight
      that nothing was needed to hold it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes
      glistening with delight. Oh, wasn&rsquo;t it beautiful? Wasn&rsquo;t it a lovely
      place? Suppose she wasn&rsquo;t really going to stay here! She would imagine she
      was. There was scope for imagination here.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against
      the house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to
      be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of apple-trees
      and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms; and their grass
      was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below were lilac-trees
      purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the
      window on the morning wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow
      where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew, upspringing
      airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in
      ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it was a hill, green
      and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in it where the gray
      gable end of the little house she had seen from the other side of the Lake
      of Shining Waters was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over green,
      low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily
      in. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child; but
      this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until
      she was startled by a hand on her shoulder. Marilla had come in unheard by
      the small dreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you were dressed,&rdquo; she said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her
      uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne stood up and drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo; she said, waving her hand comprehensively at the
      good world outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big tree,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;and it blooms great, but the fruit don&rsquo;t
      amount to much never&mdash;small and wormy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean just the tree; of course it&rsquo;s lovely&mdash;yes, it&rsquo;s <i>radiantly</i>
      lovely&mdash;it blooms as if it meant it&mdash;but I meant everything, the
      garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods, the whole big dear
      world. Don&rsquo;t you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like
      this? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here. Have you ever
      noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They&rsquo;re always laughing. Even in
      winter-time I&rsquo;ve heard them under the ice. I&rsquo;m so glad there&rsquo;s a brook
      near Green Gables. Perhaps you think it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to me
      when you&rsquo;re not going to keep me, but it does. I shall always like to
      remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it
      again. If there wasn&rsquo;t a brook I&rsquo;d be <i>haunted</i> by the uncomfortable
      feeling that there ought to be one. I&rsquo;m not in the depths of despair this
      morning. I never can be in the morning. Isn&rsquo;t it a splendid thing that
      there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I&rsquo;ve just been imagining that it
      was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever
      and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted. But the worst of
      imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that
      hurts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your
      imaginings,&rdquo; said Marilla as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.
      &ldquo;Breakfast is waiting. Wash your face and comb your hair. Leave the window
      up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed. Be as smart as
      you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down-stairs in
      ten minutes&rsquo; time, with her clothes neatly on, her hair brushed and
      braided, her face washed, and a comfortable consciousness pervading her
      soul that she had fulfilled all Marilla&rsquo;s requirements. As a matter of
      fact, however, she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty hungry this morning,&rdquo; she announced as she slipped into the
      chair Marilla placed for her. &ldquo;The world doesn&rsquo;t seem such a howling
      wilderness as it did last night. I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s a sunshiny morning. But
      I like rainy mornings real well, too. All sorts of mornings are
      interesting, don&rsquo;t you think? You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen
      through the day, and there&rsquo;s so much scope for imagination. But I&rsquo;m glad
      it&rsquo;s not rainy today because it&rsquo;s easier to be cheerful and bear up under
      affliction on a sunshiny day. I feel that I have a good deal to bear up
      under. It&rsquo;s all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself
      living through them heroically, but it&rsquo;s not so nice when you really come
      to have them, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;You talk entirely too
      much for a little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her
      continued silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of
      something not exactly natural. Matthew also held his tongue,&mdash;but
      this was natural,&mdash;so that the meal was a very silent one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating
      mechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the
      sky outside the window. This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she had
      an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child&rsquo;s body might be there
      at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland, borne
      aloft on the wings of imagination. Who would want such a child about the
      place?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Matthew wished to keep her, of all unaccountable things! Marilla felt
      that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night before,
      and that he would go on wanting it. That was Matthew&rsquo;s way&mdash;take a
      whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent
      persistency&mdash;a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its
      very silence than if he had talked it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meal was ended Anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash
      the dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you wash dishes right?&rdquo; asked Marilla distrustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well. I&rsquo;m better at looking after children, though. I&rsquo;ve had so
      much experience at that. It&rsquo;s such a pity you haven&rsquo;t any here for me to
      look after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I&rsquo;ve got
      at present. <i>You&rsquo;re</i> problem enough in all conscience. What&rsquo;s to be
      done with you I don&rsquo;t know. Matthew is a most ridiculous man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s lovely,&rdquo; said Anne reproachfully. &ldquo;He is so very
      sympathetic. He didn&rsquo;t mind how much I talked&mdash;he seemed to like it.
      I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re both queer enough, if that&rsquo;s what you mean by kindred spirits,&rdquo;
       said Marilla with a sniff. &ldquo;Yes, you may wash the dishes. Take plenty of
      hot water, and be sure you dry them well. I&rsquo;ve got enough to attend to
      this morning for I&rsquo;ll have to drive over to White Sands in the afternoon
      and see Mrs. Spencer. You&rsquo;ll come with me and we&rsquo;ll settle what&rsquo;s to be
      done with you. After you&rsquo;ve finished the dishes go up-stairs and make your
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne washed the dishes deftly enough, as Marilla who kept a sharp eye on
      the process, discerned. Later on she made her bed less successfully, for
      she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick. But is was
      done somehow and smoothed down; and then Marilla, to get rid of her, told
      her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold
      she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table,
      light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an
      extinguisher on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; demanded Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare go out,&rdquo; said Anne, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing
      all earthly joys. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t stay here there is no use in my loving Green
      Gables. And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those trees and
      flowers and the orchard and the brook I&rsquo;ll not be able to help loving it.
      It&rsquo;s hard enough now, so I won&rsquo;t make it any harder. I want to go out so
      much&mdash;everything seems to be calling to me, &lsquo;Anne, Anne, come out to
      us. Anne, Anne, we want a playmate&rsquo;&mdash;but it&rsquo;s better not. There is no
      use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is there? And it&rsquo;s
      so hard to keep from loving things, isn&rsquo;t it? That was why I was so glad
      when I thought I was going to live here. I thought I&rsquo;d have so many things
      to love and nothing to hinder me. But that brief dream is over. I am
      resigned to my fate now, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go out for fear I&rsquo;ll get
      unresigned again. What is the name of that geranium on the window-sill,
      please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the apple-scented geranium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that sort of a name. I mean just a name you gave it
      yourself. Didn&rsquo;t you give it a name? May I give it one then? May I call it&mdash;let
      me see&mdash;Bonny would do&mdash;may I call it Bonny while I&rsquo;m here? Oh,
      do let me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness, I don&rsquo;t care. But where on earth is the sense of naming a
      geranium?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums. It
      makes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a
      geranium&rsquo;s feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You
      wouldn&rsquo;t like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I shall
      call it Bonny. I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window this
      morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white. Of course, it
      won&rsquo;t always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can&rsquo;t one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her,&rdquo; muttered
      Marilla, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes. &ldquo;She is kind
      of interesting as Matthew says. I can feel already that I&rsquo;m wondering what
      on earth she&rsquo;ll say next. She&rsquo;ll be casting a spell over me, too. She&rsquo;s
      cast it over Matthew. That look he gave me when he went out said
      everything he said or hinted last night over again. I wish he was like
      other men and would talk things out. A body could answer back then and
      argue him into reason. But what&rsquo;s to be done with a man who just <i>looks?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes on
      the sky, when Marilla returned from her cellar pilgrimage. There Marilla
      left her until the early dinner was on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, Matthew?&rdquo; said
      Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew nodded and looked wistfully at Anne. Marilla intercepted the look
      and said grimly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing. I&rsquo;ll take
      Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send her
      back to Nova Scotia at once. I&rsquo;ll set your tea out for you and I&rsquo;ll be
      home in time to milk the cows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Matthew said nothing and Marilla had a sense of having wasted words
      and breath. There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won&rsquo;t talk
      back&mdash;unless it is a woman who won&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and Marilla and Anne
      set off. Matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove slowly
      through, he said, to nobody in particular as it seemed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning, and I told him I
      guessed I&rsquo;d hire him for the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla made no reply, but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious clip
      with the whip that the fat mare, unused to such treatment, whizzed
      indignantly down the lane at an alarming pace. Marilla looked back once as
      the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating Matthew leaning over the
      gate, looking wistfully after them.

      CHAPTER V. Anne&rsquo;s History
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>O you know,&rdquo; said
      Anne confidentially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to enjoy this drive. It&rsquo;s been
      my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your
      mind firmly that you will. Of course, you must make it up <i>firmly</i>. I
      am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we&rsquo;re having
      our drive. I&rsquo;m just going to think about the drive. Oh, look, there&rsquo;s one
      little early wild rose out! Isn&rsquo;t it lovely? Don&rsquo;t you think it must be
      glad to be a rose? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if roses could talk? I&rsquo;m sure they
      could tell us such lovely things. And isn&rsquo;t pink the most bewitching color
      in the world? I love it, but I can&rsquo;t wear it. Redheaded people can&rsquo;t wear
      pink, not even in imagination. Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was
      red when she was young, but got to be another color when she grew up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know as I ever did,&rdquo; said Marilla mercilessly, &ldquo;and I
      shouldn&rsquo;t think it likely to happen in your case either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is another hope gone. &lsquo;My life is a perfect graveyard of
      buried hopes.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it over
      to comfort myself whenever I&rsquo;m disappointed in anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where the comforting comes in myself,&rdquo; said Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because it sounds so nice and romantic, just as if I were a heroine
      in a book, you know. I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full
      of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isn&rsquo;t it?
      I&rsquo;m rather glad I have one. Are we going across the Lake of Shining Waters
      today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going over Barry&rsquo;s pond, if that&rsquo;s what you mean by your Lake
      of Shining Waters. We&rsquo;re going by the shore road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore road sounds nice,&rdquo; said Anne dreamily. &ldquo;Is it as nice as it sounds?
      Just when you said &lsquo;shore road&rsquo; I saw it in a picture in my mind, as quick
      as that! And White Sands is a pretty name, too; but I don&rsquo;t like it as
      well as Avonlea. Avonlea is a lovely name. It just sounds like music. How
      far is it to White Sands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s five miles; and as you&rsquo;re evidently bent on talking you might as
      well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what I <i>know</i> about myself isn&rsquo;t really worth telling,&rdquo; said
      Anne eagerly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll only let me tell you what I <i>imagine</i> about
      myself you&rsquo;ll think it ever so much more interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want any of your imaginings. Just you stick to bald facts.
      Begin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was eleven last March,&rdquo; said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts with
      a little sigh. &ldquo;And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia. My father&rsquo;s
      name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High
      School. My mother&rsquo;s name was Bertha Shirley. Aren&rsquo;t Walter and Bertha
      lovely names? I&rsquo;m so glad my parents had nice names. It would be a real
      disgrace to have a father named&mdash;well, say Jedediah, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter what a person&rsquo;s name is as long as he behaves
      himself,&rdquo; said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good
      and useful moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Anne looked thoughtful. &ldquo;I read in a book once that
      a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to
      believe it. I don&rsquo;t believe a rose <i>would</i> be as nice if it was
      called a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been a
      good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I&rsquo;m sure it would have
      been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school, too, but
      when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A husband was
      enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were a pair of babies
      and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a weeny-teeny little
      yellow house in Bolingbroke. I&rsquo;ve never seen that house, but I&rsquo;ve imagined
      it thousands of times. I think it must have had honeysuckle over the
      parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just
      inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in all the windows. Muslin
      curtains give a house such an air. I was born in that house. Mrs. Thomas
      said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I was so scrawny and tiny and
      nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful. I
      should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came
      in to scrub, wouldn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m glad she was satisfied with me anyhow, I
      would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her&mdash;because
      she didn&rsquo;t live very long after that, you see. She died of fever when I
      was just three months old. I do wish she&rsquo;d lived long enough for me to
      remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say &lsquo;mother,&rsquo; 
      don&rsquo;t you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left
      me an orphan and folks were at their wits&rsquo; end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what
      to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my
      fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well
      known they hadn&rsquo;t any relatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she&rsquo;d
      take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up
      by hand. Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that
      ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people?
      Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be
      such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand&mdash;reproachful-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I
      lived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the
      Thomas children&mdash;there were four of them younger than me&mdash;and I
      can tell you they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed
      falling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the
      children, but she didn&rsquo;t want me. Mrs. Thomas was at <i>her</i> wits&rsquo; end,
      so she said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came
      down and said she&rsquo;d take me, seeing I was handy with children, and I went
      up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps. It
      was a very lonesome place. I&rsquo;m sure I could never have lived there if I
      hadn&rsquo;t had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little sawmill up there,
      and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She had twins three times. I like
      babies in moderation, but twins three times in succession is <i>too much</i>.
      I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last pair came. I used to get so
      dreadfully tired carrying them about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond
      died and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children
      among her relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum at
      Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn&rsquo;t want me at the asylum,
      either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had to take
      me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. Evidently she did
      not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever go to school?&rdquo; demanded Marilla, turning the sorrel mare
      down the shore road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a great deal. I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs.
      Thomas. When I went up river we were so far from a school that I couldn&rsquo;t
      walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer, so I could only go
      in the spring and fall. But of course I went while I was at the asylum. I
      can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart&mdash;&lsquo;The
      Battle of Hohenlinden&rsquo; and &lsquo;Edinburgh after Flodden,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bingen of the
      Rhine,&rsquo; and most of the &lsquo;Lady of the Lake&rsquo; and most of &lsquo;The Seasons&rsquo; by
      James Thompson. Don&rsquo;t you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly
      feeling up and down your back? There is a piece in the Fifth Reader&mdash;&lsquo;The
      Downfall of Poland&rsquo;&mdash;that is just full of thrills. Of course, I
      wasn&rsquo;t in the Fifth Reader&mdash;I was only in the Fourth&mdash;but the
      big girls used to lend me theirs to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were those women&mdash;Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond&mdash;good to you?&rdquo;
       asked Marilla, looking at Anne out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-o-h,&rdquo; faltered Anne. Her sensitive little face suddenly flushed
      scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow. &ldquo;Oh, they <i>meant</i> to be&mdash;I
      know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible. And when people
      mean to be good to you, you don&rsquo;t mind very much when they&rsquo;re not quite&mdash;always.
      They had a good deal to worry them, you know. It&rsquo;s a very trying to have a
      drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to have twins three
      times in succession, don&rsquo;t you think? But I feel sure they meant to be
      good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla asked no more questions. Anne gave herself up to a silent rapture
      over the shore road and Marilla guided the sorrel abstractedly while she
      pondered deeply. Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child.
      What a starved, unloved life she had had&mdash;a life of drudgery and
      poverty and neglect; for Marilla was shrewd enough to read between the
      lines of Anne&rsquo;s history and divine the truth. No wonder she had been so
      delighted at the prospect of a real home. It was a pity she had to be sent
      back. What if she, Marilla, should indulge Matthew&rsquo;s unaccountable whim
      and let her stay? He was set on it; and the child seemed a nice, teachable
      little thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got too much to say,&rdquo; thought Marilla, &ldquo;but she might be trained
      out of that. And there&rsquo;s nothing rude or slangy in what she does say.
      She&rsquo;s ladylike. It&rsquo;s likely her people were nice folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shore road was &ldquo;woodsy and wild and lonesome.&rdquo; On the right hand,
      scrub firs, their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with the
      gulf winds, grew thickly. On the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs,
      so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel
      might have tried the nerves of the people behind her. Down at the base of
      the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with
      pebbles as with ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea, shimmering and blue, and
      over it soared the gulls, their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the sea wonderful?&rdquo; said Anne, rousing from a long, wide-eyed
      silence. &ldquo;Once, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an express
      wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away. I
      enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the children
      all the time. I lived it over in happy dreams for years. But this shore is
      nicer than the Marysville shore. Aren&rsquo;t those gulls splendid? Would you
      like to be a gull? I think I would&mdash;that is, if I couldn&rsquo;t be a human
      girl. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop
      down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day; and then
      at night to fly back to one&rsquo;s nest? Oh, I can just imagine myself doing
      it. What big house is that just ahead, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the White Sands Hotel. Mr. Kirke runs it, but the season hasn&rsquo;t
      begun yet. There are heaps of Americans come there for the summer. They
      think this shore is just about right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid it might be Mrs. Spencer&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; said Anne mournfully. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want to get there. Somehow, it will seem like the end of
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VI. Marilla Makes Up Her Mind
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>ET there they did,
      however, in due season. Mrs. Spencer lived in a big yellow house at White
      Sands Cove, and she came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on
      her benevolent face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the last folks I was looking for
      today, but I&rsquo;m real glad to see you. You&rsquo;ll put your horse in? And how are
      you, Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as well as can be expected, thank you,&rdquo; said Anne smilelessly. A
      blight seemed to have descended on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll stay a little while to rest the mare,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;but
      I promised Matthew I&rsquo;d be home early. The fact is, Mrs. Spencer, there&rsquo;s
      been a queer mistake somewhere, and I&rsquo;ve come over to see where it is. We
      send word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy from the asylum. We
      told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or eleven years
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla Cuthbert, you don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; said Mrs. Spencer in distress. &ldquo;Why,
      Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you wanted a girl&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
      she Flora Jane?&rdquo; appealing to her daughter who had come out to the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She certainly did, Miss Cuthbert,&rdquo; corroborated Flora Jane earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadful sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Spencer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad; but it certainly
      wasn&rsquo;t my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. I did the best I could and I
      thought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty
      thing. I&rsquo;ve often had to scold her well for her heedlessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was our own fault,&rdquo; said Marilla resignedly. &ldquo;We should have come to
      you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word
      of mouth in that fashion. Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the only
      thing to do is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the asylum?
      I suppose they&rsquo;ll take her back, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it will
      be necessary to send her back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here yesterday,
      and she was saying to me how much she wished she&rsquo;d sent by me for a little
      girl to help her. Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know, and she finds
      it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for you. I call it
      positively providential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with the
      matter. Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome orphan
      off her hands, and she did not even feel grateful for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced woman
      without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones. But she had heard of
      her. &ldquo;A terrible worker and driver,&rdquo; Mrs. Peter was said to be; and
      discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and stinginess,
      and her family of pert, quarrelsome children. Marilla felt a qualm of
      conscience at the thought of handing Anne over to her tender mercies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go in and we&rsquo;ll talk the matter over,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there isn&rsquo;t Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mrs. Spencer, bustling her guests through the hall into the
      parlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been
      strained so long through dark green, closely drawn blinds that it had lost
      every particle of warmth it had ever possessed. &ldquo;That is real lucky, for
      we can settle the matter right away. Take the armchair, Miss Cuthbert.
      Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don&rsquo;t wiggle. Let me take your hats.
      Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good afternoon, Mrs. Blewett. We
      were just saying how fortunate it was you happened along. Let me introduce
      you two ladies. Mrs. Blewett, Miss Cuthbert. Please excuse me for just a
      moment. I forgot to tell Flora Jane to take the buns out of the oven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. Anne sitting
      mutely on the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared
      at Mrs Blewett as one fascinated. Was she to be given into the keeping of
      this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? She felt a lump coming up in her
      throat and her eyes smarted painfully. She was beginning to be afraid she
      couldn&rsquo;t keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed and
      beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,
      mental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems there&rsquo;s been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted a
      little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems it was a boy
      they wanted. So if you&rsquo;re still of the same mind you were yesterday, I
      think she&rsquo;ll be just the thing for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you and what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley,&rdquo; faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any
      stipulations regarding the spelling thereof, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m eleven years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You don&rsquo;t look as if there was much to you. But you&rsquo;re wiry. I
      don&rsquo;t know but the wiry ones are the best after all. Well, if I take you
      you&rsquo;ll have to be a good girl, you know&mdash;good and smart and
      respectful. I&rsquo;ll expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake about that.
      Yes, I suppose I might as well take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert. The
      baby&rsquo;s awful fractious, and I&rsquo;m clean worn out attending to him. If you
      like I can take her right home now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child&rsquo;s pale face with
      its look of mute misery&mdash;the misery of a helpless little creature who
      finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.
      Marilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal of
      that look, it would haunt her to her dying day. More-over, she did not
      fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, &ldquo;highstrung&rdquo; child over to such a
      woman! No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that Matthew and I
      had absolutely decided that we wouldn&rsquo;t keep her. In fact I may say that
      Matthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to find out how the
      mistake had occurred. I think I&rsquo;d better take her home again and talk it
      over with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn&rsquo;t to decide on anything without
      consulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we&rsquo;ll bring or send
      her over to you tomorrow night. If we don&rsquo;t you may know that she is going
      to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blewett ungraciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Marilla&rsquo;s speech a sunrise had been dawning on Anne&rsquo;s face. First
      the look of despair faded out; then came a faint flush of hope; her eyes
      grew deep and bright as morning stars. The child was quite transfigured;
      and, a moment later, when Mrs. Spencer and Mrs. Blewett went out in quest
      of a recipe the latter had come to borrow she sprang up and flew across
      the room to Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay
      at Green Gables?&rdquo; she said, in a breathless whisper, as if speaking aloud
      might shatter the glorious possibility. &ldquo;Did you really say it? Or did I
      only imagine that you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better learn to control that imagination of yours, Anne, if
      you can&rsquo;t distinguish between what is real and what isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Marilla
      crossly. &ldquo;Yes, you did hear me say just that and no more. It isn&rsquo;t decided
      yet and perhaps we will conclude to let Mrs. Blewett take you after all.
      She certainly needs you much more than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her,&rdquo; said Anne
      passionately. &ldquo;She looks exactly like a&mdash;like a gimlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla smothered a smile under the conviction that Anne must be reproved
      for such a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and a
      stranger,&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;Go back and sit down quietly and hold your
      tongue and behave as a good girl should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to do and be anything you want me, if you&rsquo;ll only keep me,&rdquo; said
      Anne, returning meekly to her ottoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived back at Green Gables that evening Matthew met them in
      the lane. Marilla from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed
      his motive. She was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he
      saw that she had at least brought back Anne back with her. But she said
      nothing, to him, relative to the affair, until they were both out in the
      yard behind the barn milking the cows. Then she briefly told him Anne&rsquo;s
      history and the result of the interview with Mrs. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman,&rdquo; said Matthew with
      unusual vim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy her style myself,&rdquo; admitted Marilla, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s that or
      keeping her ourselves, Matthew. And since you seem to want her, I suppose
      I&rsquo;m willing&mdash;or have to be. I&rsquo;ve been thinking over the idea until
      I&rsquo;ve got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty. I&rsquo;ve never brought
      up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I&rsquo;ll make a terrible mess of
      it. But I&rsquo;ll do my best. So far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Matthew, she may stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew&rsquo;s shy face was a glow of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I reckoned you&rsquo;d come to see it in that light, Marilla,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s such an interesting little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little
      thing,&rdquo; retorted Marilla, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll make it my business to see she&rsquo;s
      trained to be that. And mind, Matthew, you&rsquo;re not to go interfering with
      my methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn&rsquo;t know much about bringing up a
      child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you just leave
      me to manage her. When I fail it&rsquo;ll be time enough to put your oar in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,&rdquo; said Matthew
      reassuringly. &ldquo;Only be as good and kind to her as you can without spoiling
      her. I kind of think she&rsquo;s one of the sort you can do anything with if you
      only get her to love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla sniffed, to express her contempt for Matthew&rsquo;s opinions concerning
      anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the pails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell her tonight that she can stay,&rdquo; she reflected, as she
      strained the milk into the creamers. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be so excited that she
      wouldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink. Marilla Cuthbert, you&rsquo;re fairly in for it. Did you
      ever suppose you&rsquo;d see the day when you&rsquo;d be adopting an orphan girl? It&rsquo;s
      surprising enough; but not so surprising as that Matthew should be at the
      bottom of it, him that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little
      girls. Anyhow, we&rsquo;ve decided on the experiment and goodness only knows
      what will come of it.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VII. Anne Says Her Prayers
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Marilla took
      Anne up to bed that night she said stiffly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Anne, I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the
      floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can&rsquo;t
      allow it at all. As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it
      neatly and place it on the chair. I haven&rsquo;t any use at all for little
      girls who aren&rsquo;t neat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn&rsquo;t think about my
      clothes at all,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fold them nicely tonight. They always
      made us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I&rsquo;d forget, I&rsquo;d be
      in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to remember a little better if you stay here,&rdquo; admonished
      Marilla. &ldquo;There, that looks something like. Say your prayers now and get
      into bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never say any prayers,&rdquo; announced Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla looked horrified astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?
      God always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don&rsquo;t you know who God
      is, Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His being,
      wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,&rsquo;&rdquo; responded Anne
      promptly and glibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla looked rather relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you do know something then, thank goodness! You&rsquo;re not quite a
      heathen. Where did you learn that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole catechism.
      I liked it pretty well. There&rsquo;s something splendid about some of the
      words. &lsquo;Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that grand? It has such
      a roll to it&mdash;just like a big organ playing. You couldn&rsquo;t quite call
      it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not talking about poetry, Anne&mdash;we are talking about saying
      your prayers. Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s a terrible wicked thing not to say your
      prayers every night? I&rsquo;m afraid you are a very bad little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,&rdquo; said Anne
      reproachfully. &ldquo;People who haven&rsquo;t red hair don&rsquo;t know what trouble is.
      Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red <i>on purpose</i>, and I&rsquo;ve
      never cared about Him since. And anyhow I&rsquo;d always be too tired at night
      to bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can&rsquo;t be
      expected to say their prayers. Now, do you honestly think they can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla decided that Anne&rsquo;s religious training must be begun at once.
      Plainly there was no time to be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, if you want me to,&rdquo; assented Anne cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do
      anything to oblige you. But you&rsquo;ll have to tell me what to say for this
      once. After I get into bed I&rsquo;ll imagine out a real nice prayer to say
      always. I believe that it will be quite interesting, now that I come to
      think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must kneel down,&rdquo; said Marilla in embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne knelt at Marilla&rsquo;s knee and looked up gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I&rsquo;ll tell
      you what I&rsquo;d do. I&rsquo;d go out into a great big field all alone or into the
      deep, deep, woods, and I&rsquo;d look up into the sky&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;into
      that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness.
      And then I&rsquo;d just <i>feel</i> a prayer. Well, I&rsquo;m ready. What am I to
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla felt more embarrassed than ever. She had intended to teach Anne
      the childish classic, &ldquo;Now I lay me down to sleep.&rdquo; But she had, as I have
      told you, the glimmerings of a sense of humor&mdash;which is simply
      another name for a sense of fitness of things; and it suddenly occurred to
      her that that simple little prayer, sacred to white-robed childhood
      lisping at motherly knees, was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of
      a girl who knew and cared nothing about God&rsquo;s love, since she had never
      had it translated to her through the medium of human love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re old enough to pray for yourself, Anne,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;Just
      thank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the things you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; promised Anne, burying her face in Marilla&rsquo;s lap.
      &ldquo;Gracious heavenly Father&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way the ministers say it in
      church, so I suppose it&rsquo;s all right in private prayer, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
      interjected, lifting her head for a moment.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Gracious heavenly Father, I thank Thee for the White
   Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters and Bonny
   and the Snow Queen. I&rsquo;m really extremely grateful for
   them. And that&rsquo;s all the blessings I can think of just
   now to thank Thee for. As for the things I want,
   they&rsquo;re so numerous that it would take a great deal of
   time to name them all so I will only mention the two
   most important. Please let me stay at Green Gables;
   and please let me be good-looking when I grow up.
   I remain,
                    &ldquo;Yours respectfully,
                       Anne Shirley.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, did I do all right?&rdquo; she asked eagerly, getting up. &ldquo;I could have
      made it much more flowery if I&rsquo;d had a little more time to think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering that
      it was not irreverence, but simply spiritual ignorance on the part of Anne
      that was responsible for this extraordinary petition. She tucked the child
      up in bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer the very
      next day, and was leaving the room with the light when Anne called her
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just thought of it now. I should have said, &lsquo;Amen&rsquo; in place of
      &lsquo;yours respectfully,&rsquo; shouldn&rsquo;t I?&mdash;the way the ministers do. I&rsquo;d
      forgotten it, but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so I
      put in the other. Do you suppose it will make any difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose it will,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;Go to sleep now like a
      good child. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience,&rdquo; said Anne,
      cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table, and
      glared at Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, it&rsquo;s about time somebody adopted that child and taught
      her something. She&rsquo;s next door to a perfect heathen. Will you believe that
      she never said a prayer in her life till tonight? I&rsquo;ll send her to the
      manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.
      And she shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can get some suitable
      clothes made for her. I foresee that I shall have my hands full. Well,
      well, we can&rsquo;t get through this world without our share of trouble. I&rsquo;ve
      had a pretty easy life of it so far, but my time has come at last and I
      suppose I&rsquo;ll just have to make the best of it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. Anne&rsquo;s Bringing-up Is Begun
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR reasons best
      known to herself, Marilla did not tell Anne that she was to stay at Green
      Gables until the next afternoon. During the forenoon she kept the child
      busy with various tasks and watched over her with a keen eye while she did
      them. By noon she had concluded that Anne was smart and obedient, willing
      to work and quick to learn; her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a
      tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all
      about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a
      reprimand or a catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted
      Marilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to learn
      the worst. Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her face
      flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she clasped her
      hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won&rsquo;t you tell me if you are going to send me
      away or not? I&rsquo;ve tried to be patient all the morning, but I really feel
      that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It&rsquo;s a dreadful feeling. Please
      tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to
      do,&rdquo; said Marilla immovably. &ldquo;Just go and do it before you ask any more
      questions, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla and
      fastened imploring eyes of the latter&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marilla, unable
      to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, &ldquo;I suppose I
      might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep you&mdash;that
      is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful.
      Why, child, whatever is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crying,&rdquo; said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why. I&rsquo;m
      glad as glad can be. Oh, <i>glad</i> doesn&rsquo;t seem the right word at all. I
      was glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms&mdash;but this! Oh,
      it&rsquo;s something more than glad. I&rsquo;m so happy. I&rsquo;ll try to be so good. It
      will be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was
      desperately wicked. However, I&rsquo;ll do my very best. But can you tell me why
      I&rsquo;m crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re all excited and worked up,&rdquo; said Marilla
      disapprovingly. &ldquo;Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. I&rsquo;m
      afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. Yes, you can stay here and
      we will try to do right by you. You must go to school; but it&rsquo;s only a
      fortnight till vacation so it isn&rsquo;t worth while for you to start before it
      opens again in September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to call you?&rdquo; asked Anne. &ldquo;Shall I always say Miss Cuthbert?
      Can I call you Aunt Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;ll call me just plain Marilla. I&rsquo;m not used to being called Miss
      Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,&rdquo; protested Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;ll be nothing disrespectful in it if you&rsquo;re careful to
      speak respectfully. Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me Marilla
      except the minister. He says Miss Cuthbert&mdash;when he thinks of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to call you Aunt Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne wistfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had
      an aunt or any relation at all&mdash;not even a grandmother. It would make
      me feel as if I really belonged to you. Can&rsquo;t I call you Aunt Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not your aunt and I don&rsquo;t believe in calling people names that
      don&rsquo;t belong to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we could imagine you were my aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Marilla grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?&rdquo; asked
      Anne wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Anne drew a long breath. &ldquo;Oh, Miss&mdash;Marilla, how much you
      miss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in imagining things different from what they really are,&rdquo;
       retorted Marilla. &ldquo;When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He
      doesn&rsquo;t mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me. Go into the
      sitting room, Anne&mdash;be sure your feet are clean and don&rsquo;t let any
      flies in&mdash;and bring me out the illustrated card that&rsquo;s on the
      mantelpiece. The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is on it and you&rsquo;ll devote your spare time
      this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There&rsquo;s to be no more of such
      praying as I heard last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I was very awkward,&rdquo; said Anne apologetically, &ldquo;but then, you
      see, I&rsquo;d never had any practice. You couldn&rsquo;t really expect a person to
      pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a
      splendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would. It
      was nearly as long as a minister&rsquo;s and so poetical. But would you believe
      it? I couldn&rsquo;t remember one word when I woke up this morning. And I&rsquo;m
      afraid I&rsquo;ll never be able to think out another one as good. Somehow,
      things never are so good when they&rsquo;re thought out a second time. Have you
      ever noticed that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do a thing
      I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and discourse
      about it. Just you go and do as I bid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed to
      return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting and
      marched after her with a grim expression. She found Anne standing
      motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows,
      with her eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained
      through apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little
      figure with a half-unearthly radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, whatever are you thinking of?&rdquo; demanded Marilla sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne came back to earth with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the picture&mdash;a rather vivid chromo
      entitled, &ldquo;Christ Blessing Little Children&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and I was just
      imagining I was one of them&mdash;that I was the little girl in the blue
      dress, standing off by herself in the corner as if she didn&rsquo;t belong to
      anybody, like me. She looks lonely and sad, don&rsquo;t you think? I guess she
      hadn&rsquo;t any father or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too,
      so she just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody
      would notice her&mdash;except Him. I&rsquo;m sure I know just how she felt. Her
      heart must have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when
      I asked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn&rsquo;t notice her. But
      it&rsquo;s likely He did, don&rsquo;t you think? I&rsquo;ve been trying to imagine it all
      out&mdash;her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite
      close to Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair
      and oh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her! But I wish the artist
      hadn&rsquo;t painted Him so sorrowful looking. All His pictures are like that,
      if you&rsquo;ve noticed. But I don&rsquo;t believe He could really have looked so sad
      or the children would have been afraid of Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this speech
      long before, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t talk that way. It&rsquo;s irreverent&mdash;positively
      irreverent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s eyes marveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t mean to be
      irreverent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t suppose you did&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t sound right to talk so
      familiarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I send you
      after something you&rsquo;re to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and
      imagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come right to
      the kitchen. Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had brought
      in to decorate the dinner-table&mdash;Marilla had eyed that decoration
      askance, but had said nothing&mdash;propped her chin on her hands, and
      fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like this,&rdquo; she announced at length. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful. I&rsquo;ve heard it
      before&mdash;I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it
      over once. But I didn&rsquo;t like it then. He had such a cracked voice and he
      prayed it so mournfully. I really felt sure he thought praying was a
      disagreeable duty. This isn&rsquo;t poetry, but it makes me feel just the same
      way poetry does. &lsquo;Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name.&rsquo; That
      is just like a line of music. Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you thought of making me
      learn this, Miss&mdash;Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, learn it and hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Marilla shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss
      on a pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla,&rdquo; she demanded presently, &ldquo;do you think that I shall ever have a
      bosom friend in Avonlea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a what kind of friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bosom friend&mdash;an intimate friend, you know&mdash;a really kindred
      spirit to whom I can confide my inmost soul. I&rsquo;ve dreamed of meeting her
      all my life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest
      dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do you
      think it&rsquo;s possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she&rsquo;s about your age. She&rsquo;s a
      very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when she
      comes home. She&rsquo;s visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You&rsquo;ll have
      to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a very
      particular woman. She won&rsquo;t let Diana play with any little girl who isn&rsquo;t
      nice and good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Diana like? Her hair isn&rsquo;t red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It&rsquo;s bad
      enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn&rsquo;t endure it in a
      bosom friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and rosy
      cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was firmly
      convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a child who
      was being brought up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the
      delightful possibilities before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad she&rsquo;s pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s impossible in my case&mdash;it would be best to have a beautiful
      bosom friend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her
      sitting room with glass doors. There weren&rsquo;t any books in it; Mrs. Thomas
      kept her best china and her preserves there&mdash;when she had any
      preserves to keep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one
      night when he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used
      to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in
      it. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to talk
      to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything. Katie
      was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend that the
      bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I could open the
      door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice lived, instead of
      into Mrs. Thomas&rsquo; shelves of preserves and china. And then Katie Maurice
      would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place, all
      flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have lived there happy for
      ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond it just broke my heart
      to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully, too, I know she did, for
      she was crying when she kissed me good-bye through the bookcase door.
      There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond&rsquo;s. But just up the river a little
      way from the house there was a long green little valley, and the loveliest
      echo lived there. It echoed back every word you said, even if you didn&rsquo;t
      talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it was a little girl called Violetta
      and we were great friends and I loved her almost as well as I loved Katie
      Maurice&mdash;not quite, but almost, you know. The night before I went to
      the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta, and oh, her good-bye came back to
      me in such sad, sad tones. I had become so attached to her that I hadn&rsquo;t
      the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum, even if there had been
      any scope for imagination there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just as well there wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Marilla drily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own imaginations.
      It will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense
      out of your head. But don&rsquo;t let Mrs. Barry hear you talking about your
      Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she&rsquo;ll think you tell stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t talk of them to everybody&mdash;their memories
      are too sacred for that. But I thought I&rsquo;d like to have you know about
      them. Oh, look, here&rsquo;s a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom.
      Just think what a lovely place to live&mdash;in an apple blossom! Fancy
      going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it. If I wasn&rsquo;t a human
      girl I think I&rsquo;d like to be a bee and live among the flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull,&rdquo; sniffed Marilla. &ldquo;I think you are
      very fickle minded. I told you to learn that prayer and not talk. But it
      seems impossible for you to stop talking if you&rsquo;ve got anybody that will
      listen to you. So go up to your room and learn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it pretty nearly all now&mdash;all but just the last line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind, do as I tell you. Go to your room and finish learning
      it well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?&rdquo; pleaded Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you don&rsquo;t want your room cluttered up with flowers. You should have
      left them on the tree in the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did feel a little that way, too,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I kind of felt I
      shouldn&rsquo;t shorten their lovely lives by picking them&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t want
      to be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation was <i>irresistible</i>.
      What do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming
      upstairs. Now I&rsquo;m going to imagine things into this room so that they&rsquo;ll
      always stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with
      pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows.
      The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The furniture is
      mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound <i>so</i> luxurious.
      This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions, pink and blue
      and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it. I can see my
      reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall. I am tall and
      regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a pearl cross on my
      breast and pearls in my hair. My hair is of midnight darkness and my skin
      is a clear ivory pallor. My name is the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. No, it
      isn&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t make <i>that</i> seem real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her pointed
      freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only Anne of Green Gables,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;and I see you,
      just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I&rsquo;m the Lady
      Cordelia. But it&rsquo;s a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than
      Anne of nowhere in particular, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent forward, kissed her reflection affectionately, and betook herself
      to the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Snow Queen, good afternoon. And good afternoon dear birches down in
      the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I wonder
      if Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall love her
      very much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice and Violetta. They
      would feel so hurt if I did and I&rsquo;d hate to hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelings, even
      a little bookcase girl&rsquo;s or a little echo girl&rsquo;s. I must be careful to
      remember them and send them a kiss every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry
      blossoms and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out on
      a sea of daydreams.

      CHAPTER IX. Mrs. Rachel Lynde Is Properly Horrified
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE had been a
      fortnight at Green Gables before Mrs. Lynde arrived to inspect her. Mrs.
      Rachel, to do her justice, was not to blame for this. A severe and
      unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady to her house
      ever since the occasion of her last visit to Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel was
      not often sick and had a well-defined contempt for people who were; but
      grippe, she asserted, was like no other illness on earth and could only be
      interpreted as one of the special visitations of Providence. As soon as
      her doctor allowed her to put her foot out-of-doors she hurried up to
      Green Gables, bursting with curiosity to see Matthew and Marilla&rsquo;s orphan,
      concerning whom all sorts of stories and suppositions had gone abroad in
      Avonlea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight. Already
      she was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place. She had
      discovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up
      through a belt of woodland; and she had explored it to its furthest end in
      all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge, fir coppice and wild
      cherry arch, corners thick with fern, and branching byways of maple and
      mountain ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made friends with the spring down in the hollow&mdash;that
      wonderful deep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red
      sandstones and rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and
      beyond it was a log bridge over the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      That bridge led Anne&rsquo;s dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond, where
      perpetual twilight reigned under the straight, thick-growing firs and
      spruces; the only flowers there were myriads of delicate &ldquo;June bells,&rdquo;
       those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms, and a few pale, aerial
      starflowers, like the spirits of last year&rsquo;s blossoms. Gossamers glimmered
      like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and tassels
      seemed to utter friendly speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hours
      which she was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and Marilla
      half-deaf over her discoveries. Not that Matthew complained, to be sure;
      he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his face;
      Marilla permitted the &ldquo;chatter&rdquo; until she found herself becoming too
      interested in it, whereupon she always promptly quenched Anne by a curt
      command to hold her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was out in the orchard when Mrs. Rachel came, wandering at her own
      sweet will through the lush, tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy evening
      sunshine; so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk her illness
      fully over, describing every ache and pulse beat with such evident
      enjoyment that Marilla thought even grippe must bring its compensations.
      When details were exhausted Mrs. Rachel introduced the real reason of her
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself,&rdquo; said
      Marilla. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting over my surprise now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was too bad there was such a mistake,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel
      sympathetically. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have sent her back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her.
      And I must say I like her myself&mdash;although I admit she has her
      faults. The house seems a different place already. She&rsquo;s a real bright
      little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she
      read disapproval in Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great responsibility you&rsquo;ve taken on yourself,&rdquo; said that lady
      gloomily, &ldquo;especially when you&rsquo;ve never had any experience with children.
      You don&rsquo;t know much about her or her real disposition, I suppose, and
      there&rsquo;s no guessing how a child like that will turn out. But I don&rsquo;t want
      to discourage you I&rsquo;m sure, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not feeling discouraged,&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s dry response, &ldquo;when I make up
      my mind to do a thing it stays made up. I suppose you&rsquo;d like to see Anne.
      I&rsquo;ll call her in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of her
      orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in the
      unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside the door.
      She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short tight wincey
      dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin legs seemed
      ungracefully long. Her freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than
      ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into over-brilliant disorder;
      it had never looked redder than at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they didn&rsquo;t pick you for your looks, that&rsquo;s sure and certain,&rdquo; was
      Mrs. Rachel Lynde&rsquo;s emphatic comment. Mrs. Rachel was one of those
      delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their mind
      without fear or favor. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s terrible skinny and homely, Marilla. Come
      here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart, did any one ever
      see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! Come here, child, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne &ldquo;came there,&rdquo; but not exactly as Mrs. Rachel expected. With one bound
      she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before Mrs. Rachel, her face
      scarlet with anger, her lips quivering, and her whole slender form
      trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; she cried in a choked voice, stamping her foot on the floor.
      &ldquo;I hate you&mdash;I hate you&mdash;I hate you&mdash;&rdquo; a louder stamp with
      each assertion of hatred. &ldquo;How dare you call me skinny and ugly? How dare
      you say I&rsquo;m freckled and redheaded? You are a rude, impolite, unfeeling
      woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne!&rdquo; exclaimed Marilla in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anne continued to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes blazing,
      hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her like an
      atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you say such things about me?&rdquo; she repeated vehemently. &ldquo;How
      would you like to have such things said about you? How would you like to
      be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn&rsquo;t a spark of
      imagination in you? I don&rsquo;t care if I do hurt your feelings by saying so!
      I hope I hurt them. You have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt
      before even by Mrs. Thomas&rsquo; intoxicated husband. And I&rsquo;ll <i>never</i>
      forgive you for it, never, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stamp! Stamp!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did anybody ever see such a temper!&rdquo; exclaimed the horrified Mrs. Rachel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne go to your room and stay there until I come up,&rdquo; said Marilla,
      recovering her powers of speech with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne, bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the
      tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the
      hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that
      the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t envy you your job bringing <i>that</i> up, Marilla,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Rachel with unspeakable solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or
      deprecation. What she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have twitted her about her looks, Rachel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla Cuthbert, you don&rsquo;t mean to say that you are upholding her in
      such a terrible display of temper as we&rsquo;ve just seen?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
      Rachel indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Marilla slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to excuse her. She&rsquo;s been very
      naughty and I&rsquo;ll have to give her a talking to about it. But we must make
      allowances for her. She&rsquo;s never been taught what is right. And you <i>were</i>
      too hard on her, Rachel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla could not help tacking on that last sentence, although she was
      again surprised at herself for doing it. Mrs. Rachel got up with an air of
      offended dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see that I&rsquo;ll have to be very careful what I say after this,
      Marilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness knows
      where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not vexed&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      worry yourself. I&rsquo;m too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my
      mind. You&rsquo;ll have your own troubles with that child. But if you&rsquo;ll take my
      advice&mdash;which I suppose you won&rsquo;t do, although I&rsquo;ve brought up ten
      children and buried two&mdash;you&rsquo;ll do that &lsquo;talking to&rsquo; you mention with
      a fair-sized birch switch. I should think <i>that</i> would be the most
      effective language for that kind of a child. Her temper matches her hair I
      guess. Well, good evening, Marilla. I hope you&rsquo;ll come down to see me
      often as usual. But you can&rsquo;t expect me to visit here again in a hurry, if
      I&rsquo;m liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It&rsquo;s something
      new in <i>my</i> experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away&mdash;if a fat woman who always
      waddled <i>could</i> be said to sweep away&mdash;and Marilla with a very
      solemn face betook herself to the east gable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do. She
      felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted. How
      unfortunate that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs. Rachel
      Lynde, of all people! Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an
      uncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation
      over this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect in
      Anne&rsquo;s disposition. And how was she to punish her? The amiable suggestion
      of the birch switch&mdash;to the efficiency of which all of Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s
      own children could have borne smarting testimony&mdash;did not appeal to
      Marilla. She did not believe she could whip a child. No, some other method
      of punishment must be found to bring Anne to a proper realization of the
      enormity of her offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla found Anne face downward on her bed, crying bitterly, quite
      oblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; she said not ungently.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; with greater severity, &ldquo;get off that bed this minute and listen to
      what I have to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it, her face
      swollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a nice way for you to behave. Anne! Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t any right to call me ugly and redheaded,&rdquo; retorted Anne,
      evasive and defiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to
      her, Anne. I was ashamed of you&mdash;thoroughly ashamed of you. I wanted
      you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have disgraced
      me. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why you should lose your temper like that just
      because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You say it
      yourself often enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but there&rsquo;s such a difference between saying a thing yourself and
      hearing other people say it,&rdquo; wailed Anne. &ldquo;You may know a thing is so,
      but you can&rsquo;t help hoping other people don&rsquo;t quite think it is. I suppose
      you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. When she said
      those things something just rose right up in me and choked me. I <i>had</i>
      to fly out at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say. Mrs. Lynde will
      have a nice story to tell about you everywhere&mdash;and she&rsquo;ll tell it,
      too. It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that
      you were skinny and ugly,&rdquo; pleaded Anne tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla. She had been a very
      small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, &ldquo;What a
      pity she is such a dark, homely little thing.&rdquo; Marilla was every day of
      fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what she
      did to you, Anne,&rdquo; she admitted in a softer tone. &ldquo;Rachel is too
      outspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She was a
      stranger and an elderly person and my visitor&mdash;all three very good
      reasons why you should have been respectful to her. You were rude and
      saucy and&rdquo;&mdash;Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment&mdash;&ldquo;you
      must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask
      her to forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never do that,&rdquo; said Anne determinedly and darkly. &ldquo;You can punish
      me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark, damp
      dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water
      and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,&rdquo; said
      Marilla drily, &ldquo;especially as they&rsquo;re rather scarce in Avonlea. But
      apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you&rsquo;ll stay here in your
      room until you can tell me you&rsquo;re willing to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to stay here forever then,&rdquo; said Anne mournfully, &ldquo;because I
      can&rsquo;t tell Mrs. Lynde I&rsquo;m sorry I said those things to her. How can I? I&rsquo;m
      <i>not</i> sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve vexed you; but I&rsquo;m <i>glad</i> I told her
      just what I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry when
      I&rsquo;m not, can I? I can&rsquo;t even <i>imagine</i> I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning,&rdquo;
       said Marilla, rising to depart. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the night to think over your
      conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You said you would try to
      be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but I must say it
      hasn&rsquo;t seemed very much like it this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne&rsquo;s stormy bosom, Marilla
      descended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in soul.
      She was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she recalled
      Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with amusement and
      she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. Anne&rsquo;s Apology
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA said
      nothing to Matthew about the affair that evening; but when Anne proved
      still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be made to account
      for her absence from the breakfast table. Marilla told Matthew the whole
      story, taking pains to impress him with a due sense of the enormity of
      Anne&rsquo;s behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she&rsquo;s a meddlesome old
      gossip,&rdquo; was Matthew&rsquo;s consolatory rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, I&rsquo;m astonished at you. You know that Anne&rsquo;s behavior
      was dreadful, and yet you take her part! I suppose you&rsquo;ll be saying next
      thing that she oughtn&rsquo;t to be punished at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now&mdash;no&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; said Matthew uneasily. &ldquo;I reckon
      she ought to be punished a little. But don&rsquo;t be too hard on her, Marilla.
      Recollect she hasn&rsquo;t ever had anyone to teach her right. You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      going to give her something to eat, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?&rdquo;
       demanded Marilla indignantly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have her meals regular, and I&rsquo;ll
      carry them up to her myself. But she&rsquo;ll stay up there until she&rsquo;s willing
      to apologize to Mrs. Lynde, and that&rsquo;s final, Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast, dinner, and supper were very silent meals&mdash;for Anne still
      remained obdurate. After each meal Marilla carried a well-filled tray to
      the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted.
      Matthew eyed its last descent with a troubled eye. Had Anne eaten anything
      at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back
      pasture, Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching,
      slipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs. As a
      general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little
      bedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured
      uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to
      tea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he
      helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the door
      of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his fingers
      and then open the door to peep in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out
      into the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew&rsquo;s heart
      smote him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, &ldquo;how are you making
      it, Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne smiled wanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of
      course, it&rsquo;s rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary imprisonment
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without loss
      of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. &ldquo;Well now, Anne, don&rsquo;t you think
      you&rsquo;d better do it and have it over with?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be
      done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla&rsquo;s a dreadful deter-mined woman&mdash;dreadful
      determined, Anne. Do it right off, I say, and have it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;apologize&mdash;that&rsquo;s the very word,&rdquo; said Matthew eagerly.
      &ldquo;Just smooth it over so to speak. That&rsquo;s what I was trying to get at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I could do it to oblige you,&rdquo; said Anne thoughtfully. &ldquo;It would
      be true enough to say I am sorry, because I <i>am</i> sorry now. I wasn&rsquo;t
      a bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all
      night. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just furious
      every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn&rsquo;t in a temper anymore&mdash;and
      it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed of myself. But
      I just couldn&rsquo;t think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde so. It would be so
      humiliating. I made up my mind I&rsquo;d stay shut up here forever rather than
      do that. But still&mdash;I&rsquo;d do anything for you&mdash;if you really want
      me to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, of course I do. It&rsquo;s terrible lonesome downstairs without you.
      Just go and smooth things over&mdash;that&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Anne resignedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Marilla as soon as she comes
      in I&rsquo;ve repented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s right, Anne. But don&rsquo;t tell Marilla I said
      anything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I promised
      not to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wild horses won&rsquo;t drag the secret from me,&rdquo; promised Anne solemnly. &ldquo;How
      would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Matthew was gone, scared at his own success. He fled hastily to the
      remotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what he
      had been up to. Marilla herself, upon her return to the house, was
      agreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling, &ldquo;Marilla&rdquo; over the
      banisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, going into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I lost my temper and said rude things, and I&rsquo;m willing to go
      and tell Mrs. Lynde so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Marilla&rsquo;s crispness gave no sign of her relief. She had been
      wondering what under the canopy she should do if Anne did not give in.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you down after milking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, after milking, behold Marilla and Anne walking down the lane,
      the former erect and triumphant, the latter drooping and dejected. But
      halfway down Anne&rsquo;s dejection vanished as if by enchantment. She lifted
      her head and stepped lightly along, her eyes fixed on the sunset sky and
      an air of subdued exhilaration about her. Marilla beheld the change
      disapprovingly. This was no meek penitent such as it behooved her to take
      into the presence of the offended Mrs. Lynde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of, Anne?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde,&rdquo; answered Anne dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was satisfactory&mdash;or should have been so. But Marilla could not
      rid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was
      going askew. Anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapt and radiant Anne continued until they were in the very presence of
      Mrs. Lynde, who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window. Then the
      radiance vanished. Mournful penitence appeared on every feature. Before a
      word was spoken Anne suddenly went down on her knees before the astonished
      Mrs. Rachel and held out her hands beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry,&rdquo; she said with a quiver in her
      voice. &ldquo;I could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up a whole
      dictionary. You must just imagine it. I behaved terribly to you&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ve disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have let me stay
      at Green Gables although I&rsquo;m not a boy. I&rsquo;m a dreadfully wicked and
      ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable
      people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you
      told me the truth. It <i>was</i> the truth; every word you said was true.
      My hair is red and I&rsquo;m freckled and skinny and ugly. What I said to you
      was true, too, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have said it. Oh, Mrs. Lynde, please,
      please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor
      little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a dreadful temper? Oh, I am
      sure you wouldn&rsquo;t. Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne clasped her hands together, bowed her head, and waited for the word
      of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking her sincerity&mdash;it breathed in every tone of
      her voice. Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring.
      But the former under-stood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying her
      valley of humiliation&mdash;was reveling in the thoroughness of her
      abasement. Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla, had
      plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see this.
      She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and all
      resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, get up, child,&rdquo; she said heartily. &ldquo;Of course I forgive
      you. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I&rsquo;m such an
      outspoken person. You just mustn&rsquo;t mind me, that&rsquo;s what. It can&rsquo;t be
      denied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once&mdash;went to
      school with her, in fact&mdash;whose hair was every mite as red as yours
      when she was young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome
      auburn. I wouldn&rsquo;t be a mite surprised if yours did, too&mdash;not a
      mite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Lynde!&rdquo; Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet. &ldquo;You
      have given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh, I
      could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn
      when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one&rsquo;s hair was a
      handsome auburn, don&rsquo;t you think? And now may I go out into your garden
      and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and Marilla are
      talking? There is so much more scope for imagination out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws, yes, run along, child. And you can pick a bouquet of them white
      June lilies over in the corner if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed behind Anne Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla; it&rsquo;s easier than
      the one you&rsquo;ve got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit on. Yes, she
      certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of taking about her
      after all. I don&rsquo;t feel so surprised at you and Matthew keeping her as I
      did&mdash;nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn out all right. Of
      course, she has a queer way of expressing herself&mdash;a little too&mdash;well,
      too kind of forcible, you know; but she&rsquo;ll likely get over that now that
      she&rsquo;s come to live among civilized folks. And then, her temper&rsquo;s pretty
      quick, I guess; but there&rsquo;s one comfort, a child that has a quick temper,
      just blaze up and cool down, ain&rsquo;t never likely to be sly or deceitful.
      Preserve me from a sly child, that&rsquo;s what. On the whole, Marilla, I kind
      of like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the
      orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologized pretty well, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she said proudly as they went down
      the lane. &ldquo;I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it
      thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did it thoroughly, all right enough,&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s comment. Marilla
      was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the recollection.
      She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold Anne for
      apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She compromised with
      her conscience by saying severely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope
      you&rsquo;ll try to control your temper now, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard if people wouldn&rsquo;t twit me about my looks,&rdquo; said
      Anne with a sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get cross about other things; but I&rsquo;m <i>so</i>
      tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right over.
      Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I grow up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t think so much about your looks, Anne. I&rsquo;m afraid you are a
      very vain little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I be vain when I know I&rsquo;m homely?&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;I love pretty
      things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that isn&rsquo;t
      pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful&mdash;just as I feel when I look at
      any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn&rsquo;t beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome is as handsome does,&rdquo; quoted Marilla. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had that said to me
      before, but I have my doubts about it,&rdquo; remarked skeptical Anne, sniffing
      at her narcissi. &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t these flowers sweet! It was lovely of Mrs.
      Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs. Lynde now.
      It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven,
      doesn&rsquo;t it? Aren&rsquo;t the stars bright tonight? If you could live in a star,
      which one would you pick? I&rsquo;d like that lovely clear big one away over
      there above that dark hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, do hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to
      follow the gyrations of Anne&rsquo;s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy
      wind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young
      dew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through
      the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came close to
      Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman&rsquo;s hard palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely to be going home and know it&rsquo;s home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I love Green
      Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever seemed
      like home. Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;m so happy. I could pray right now and not find
      it a bit hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla&rsquo;s heart at touch of that
      thin little hand in her own&mdash;a throb of the maternity she had missed,
      perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her. She
      hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a
      moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be a good girl you&rsquo;ll always be happy, Anne. And you should
      never find it hard to say your prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saying one&rsquo;s prayers isn&rsquo;t exactly the same thing as praying,&rdquo; said Anne
      meditatively. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to imagine that I&rsquo;m the wind that is blowing
      up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I&rsquo;ll imagine
      I&rsquo;m gently waving down here in the ferns&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll fly over to
      Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s garden and set the flowers dancing&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll go
      with one great swoop over the clover field&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll blow over
      the Lake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling
      waves. Oh, there&rsquo;s so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I&rsquo;ll not
      talk any more just now, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks be to goodness for that,&rdquo; breathed Marilla in devout relief.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. Anne&rsquo;s Impressions of Sunday-School
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, how do you
      like them?&rdquo; said Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new dresses
      spread out on the bed. One was of snuffy colored gingham which Marilla had
      been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked
      so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered sateen which she had
      picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and one was a stiff print of
      an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that week at a Carmody store.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made them up herself, and they were all made alike&mdash;plain
      skirts fulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and
      skirt and tight as sleeves could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll imagine that I like them,&rdquo; said Anne soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to imagine it,&rdquo; said Marilla, offended. &ldquo;Oh, I can see
      you don&rsquo;t like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren&rsquo;t they neat
      and clean and new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you like them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re&mdash;they&rsquo;re not&mdash;pretty,&rdquo; said Anne reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo; Marilla sniffed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t trouble my head about getting pretty
      dresses for you. I don&rsquo;t believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I&rsquo;ll tell you
      that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable dresses,
      without any frills or furbelows about them, and they&rsquo;re all you&rsquo;ll get
      this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school
      when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday school. I&rsquo;ll
      expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them. I should
      think you&rsquo;d be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey
      things you&rsquo;ve been wearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i> grateful,&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d be ever so much
      gratefuller if&mdash;if you&rsquo;d made just one of them with puffed sleeves.
      Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill,
      Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to do without your thrill. I hadn&rsquo;t any material to
      waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things
      anyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and
      sensible all by myself,&rdquo; persisted Anne mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your closet,
      and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got a quarterly
      from Mr. Bell for you and you&rsquo;ll go to Sunday school tomorrow,&rdquo; said
      Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,&rdquo; she whispered
      disconsolately. &ldquo;I prayed for one, but I didn&rsquo;t much expect it on that
      account. I didn&rsquo;t suppose God would have time to bother about a little
      orphan girl&rsquo;s dress. I knew I&rsquo;d just have to depend on Marilla for it.
      Well, fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of snow-white muslin
      with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented Marilla from going
      to Sunday-school with Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde, Anne,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
      see that you get into the right class. Now, mind you behave yourself
      properly. Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to show you our
      pew. Here&rsquo;s a cent for collection. Don&rsquo;t stare at people and don&rsquo;t fidget.
      I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white
      sateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to
      the charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of
      her thin figure. Her hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the
      extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed Anne, who had
      permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers. The latter,
      however, were supplied before Anne reached the main road, for being
      confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred
      buttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and liberally
      garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them. Whatever other people might
      have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped gaily down
      the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow
      very proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had reached Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s house she found that lady gone. Nothing
      daunted, Anne proceeded onward to the church alone. In the porch she found
      a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in whites and
      blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in
      their midst, with her extraordinary head adornment. Avonlea little girls
      had already heard queer stories about Anne. Mrs. Lynde said she had an
      awful temper; Jerry Buote, the hired boy at Green Gables, said she talked
      all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers like a crazy girl.
      They looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies.
      Nobody made any friendly advances, then or later on when the opening
      exercises were over and Anne found herself in Miss Rogerson&rsquo;s class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class
      for twenty years. Her method of teaching was to ask the printed questions
      from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little
      girl she thought ought to answer the question. She looked very often at
      Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla&rsquo;s drilling, answered promptly; but it
      may be questioned if she understood very much about either question or
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable;
      every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that
      life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did you like Sunday school?&rdquo; Marilla wanted to know when Anne
      came home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane, so
      Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it a bit. It was horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley!&rdquo; said Marilla rebukingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny&rsquo;s
      leaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might have been lonesome while I was away,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And now
      about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs. Lynde
      was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with a lot
      of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window
      while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer.
      I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if I hadn&rsquo;t been
      sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining
      Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done anything of the sort. You should have listened to
      Mr. Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he wasn&rsquo;t talking to me,&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;He was talking to God and
      he didn&rsquo;t seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think he
      thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white birches
      hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them, &lsquo;way, &lsquo;way
      down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a beautiful dream! It
      gave me a thrill and I just said, &lsquo;Thank you for it, God,&rsquo; two or three
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not out loud, I hope,&rdquo; said Marilla anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last and
      they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson&rsquo;s class. There
      were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried to
      imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn&rsquo;t. Why couldn&rsquo;t I? It was as
      easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in the east
      gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly
      puffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school. You
      should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so
      many. I don&rsquo;t think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were
      lots I wanted to ask her, but I didn&rsquo;t like to because I didn&rsquo;t think she
      was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a
      paraphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn&rsquo;t, but I could
      recite, &lsquo;The Dog at His Master&rsquo;s Grave&rsquo; if she liked. That&rsquo;s in the Third
      Royal Reader. It isn&rsquo;t a really truly religious piece of poetry, but it&rsquo;s
      so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it wouldn&rsquo;t do
      and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday. I read
      it over in church afterwards and it&rsquo;s splendid. There are two lines in
      particular that just thrill me.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;&lsquo;Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell
   In Midian&rsquo;s evil day.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;squadrons&rsquo; means nor &lsquo;Midian,&rsquo; either, but it sounds
      <i>so</i> tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it. I&rsquo;ll
      practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss Rogerson&mdash;because
      Mrs. Lynde was too far away&mdash;to show me your pew. I sat just as still
      as I could and the text was Revelations, third chapter, second and third
      verses. It was a very long text. If I was a minister I&rsquo;d pick the short,
      snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long, too. I suppose the minister had
      to match it to the text. I didn&rsquo;t think he was a bit interesting. The
      trouble with him seems to be that he hasn&rsquo;t enough imagination. I didn&rsquo;t
      listen to him very much. I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the
      most surprising things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but she
      was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had said,
      especially about the minister&rsquo;s sermons and Mr. Bell&rsquo;s prayers, were what
      she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for years, but had
      never given expression to. It almost seemed to her that those secret,
      unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape
      and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. A Solemn Vow and Promise
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was not until
      the next Friday that Marilla heard the story of the flower-wreathed hat.
      She came home from Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s and called Anne to account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, Mrs. Rachel says you went to church last Sunday with your hat
      rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups. What on earth put you up
      to such a caper? A pretty-looking object you must have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. I know pink and yellow aren&rsquo;t becoming to me,&rdquo; began Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Becoming fiddlesticks! It was putting flowers on your hat at all, no
      matter what color they were, that was ridiculous. You are the most
      aggravating child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat than
      on your dress,&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;Lots of little girls there had bouquets
      pinned on their dresses. What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of
      the abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer me back like that, Anne. It was very silly of you to do such
      a thing. Never let me catch you at such a trick again. Mrs. Rachel says
      she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come in all
      rigged out like that. She couldn&rsquo;t get near enough to tell you to take
      them off till it was too late. She says people talked about it something
      dreadful. Of course they would think I had no better sense than to let you
      go decked out like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Anne, tears welling into her eyes. &ldquo;I never
      thought you&rsquo;d mind. The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty I
      thought they&rsquo;d look lovely on my hat. Lots of the little girls had
      artificial flowers on their hats. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to be a dreadful
      trial to you. Maybe you&rsquo;d better send me back to the asylum. That would be
      terrible; I don&rsquo;t think I could endure it; most likely I would go into
      consumption; I&rsquo;m so thin as it is, you see. But that would be better than
      being a trial to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child cry.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to send you back to the asylum, I&rsquo;m sure. All I want is that
      you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself
      ridiculous. Don&rsquo;t cry any more. I&rsquo;ve got some news for you. Diana Barry
      came home this afternoon. I&rsquo;m going up to see if I can borrow a skirt
      pattern from Mrs. Barry, and if you like you can come with me and get
      acquainted with Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne rose to her feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on
      her cheeks; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;m frightened&mdash;now that it has come I&rsquo;m actually
      frightened. What if she shouldn&rsquo;t like me! It would be the most tragical
      disappointment of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get into a fluster. And I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t use such long
      words. It sounds so funny in a little girl. I guess Diana &lsquo;ll like you
      well enough. It&rsquo;s her mother you&rsquo;ve got to reckon with. If she doesn&rsquo;t
      like you it won&rsquo;t matter how much Diana does. If she has heard about your
      outburst to Mrs. Lynde and going to church with buttercups round your hat
      I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;ll think of you. You must be polite and well
      behaved, and don&rsquo;t make any of your startling speeches. For pity&rsquo;s sake,
      if the child isn&rsquo;t actually trembling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne <i>was</i> trembling. Her face was pale and tense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, you&rsquo;d be excited, too, if you were going to meet a little
      girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn&rsquo;t like
      you,&rdquo; she said as she hastened to get her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went over to Orchard Slope by the short cut across the brook and up
      the firry hill grove. Mrs. Barry came to the kitchen door in answer to
      Marilla&rsquo;s knock. She was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a
      very resolute mouth. She had the reputation of being very strict with her
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Marilla?&rdquo; she said cordially. &ldquo;Come in. And this is the
      little girl you have adopted, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this is Anne Shirley,&rdquo; said Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spelled with an E,&rdquo; gasped Anne, who, tremulous and excited as she was,
      was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and said
      kindly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit, thank you
      ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Anne gravely. Then aside to Marilla in an audible whisper,
      &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anything startling in that, was there, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the
      callers entered. She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother&rsquo;s
      black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was
      her inheritance from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my little girl Diana,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barry. &ldquo;Diana, you might take
      Anne out into the garden and show her your flowers. It will be better for
      you than straining your eyes over that book. She reads entirely too much&mdash;&rdquo;
       this to Marilla as the little girls went out&mdash;&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t prevent
      her, for her father aids and abets her. She&rsquo;s always poring over a book.
      I&rsquo;m glad she has the prospect of a playmate&mdash;perhaps it will take her
      more out-of-doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside in the garden, which was full of mellow sunset light streaming
      through the dark old firs to the west of it, stood Anne and Diana, gazing
      bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have
      delighted Anne&rsquo;s heart at any time less fraught with destiny. It was
      encircled by huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished
      flowers that loved the shade. Prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered
      with clamshells, intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds
      between old-fashioned flowers ran riot. There were rosy bleeding-hearts
      and great splendid crimson peonies; white, fragrant narcissi and thorny,
      sweet Scotch roses; pink and blue and white columbines and lilac-tinted
      Bouncing Bets; clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint; purple
      Adam-and-Eve, daffodils, and masses of sweet clover white with its
      delicate, fragrant, feathery sprays; scarlet lightning that shot its fiery
      lances over prim white musk-flowers; a garden it was where sunshine
      lingered and bees hummed, and winds, beguiled into loitering, purred and
      rustled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana,&rdquo; said Anne at last, clasping her hands and speaking almost in
      a whisper, &ldquo;oh, do you think you can like me a little&mdash;enough to be
      my bosom friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana laughed. Diana always laughed before she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I guess so,&rdquo; she said frankly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad you&rsquo;ve come to live
      at Green Gables. It will be jolly to have somebody to play with. There
      isn&rsquo;t any other girl who lives near enough to play with, and I&rsquo;ve no
      sisters big enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever?&rdquo; demanded Anne eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diana looked shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s dreadfully wicked to swear,&rdquo; she said rebukingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, not my kind of swearing. There are two kinds, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of but one kind,&rdquo; said Diana doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There really is another. Oh, it isn&rsquo;t wicked at all. It just means vowing
      and promising solemnly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind doing that,&rdquo; agreed Diana, relieved. &ldquo;How do you do
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must join hands&mdash;so,&rdquo; said Anne gravely. &ldquo;It ought to be over
      running water. We&rsquo;ll just imagine this path is running water. I&rsquo;ll repeat
      the oath first. I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend, Diana
      Barry, as long as the sun and moon shall endure. Now you say it and put my
      name in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana repeated the &ldquo;oath&rdquo; with a laugh fore and aft. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer girl, Anne. I heard before that you were queer. But I
      believe I&rsquo;m going to like you real well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Marilla and Anne went home Diana went with them as far as the log
      bridge. The two little girls walked with their arms about each other. At
      the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?&rdquo; asked Marilla as they went up
      through the garden of Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on Marilla&rsquo;s
      part. &ldquo;Oh Marilla, I&rsquo;m the happiest girl on Prince Edward Island this very
      moment. I assure you I&rsquo;ll say my prayers with a right good-will tonight.
      Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr. William Bell&rsquo;s birch
      grove tomorrow. Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in
      the woodshed? Diana&rsquo;s birthday is in February and mine is in March. Don&rsquo;t
      you think that is a very strange coincidence? Diana is going to lend me a
      book to read. She says it&rsquo;s perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting.
      She&rsquo;s going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow.
      Don&rsquo;t you think Diana has got very soulful eyes? I wish I had soulful
      eyes. Diana is going to teach me to sing a song called &lsquo;Nelly in the Hazel
      Dell.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s going to give me a picture to put up in my room; it&rsquo;s a
      perfectly beautiful picture, she says&mdash;a lovely lady in a pale blue
      silk dress. A sewing-machine agent gave it to her. I wish I had something
      to give Diana. I&rsquo;m an inch taller than Diana, but she is ever so much
      fatter; she says she&rsquo;d like to be thin because it&rsquo;s so much more graceful,
      but I&rsquo;m afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings. We&rsquo;re going to the
      shore some day to gather shells. We have agreed to call the spring down by
      the log bridge the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble. Isn&rsquo;t that a perfectly elegant name? I
      read a story once about a spring called that. A dryad is sort of a
      grown-up fairy, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all I hope is you won&rsquo;t talk Diana to death,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;But
      remember this in all your planning, Anne. You&rsquo;re not going to play all the
      time nor most of it. You&rsquo;ll have your work to do and it&rsquo;ll have to be done
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow. He
      had just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody, and he sheepishly
      produced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to Anne, with a
      deprecatory look at Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; sniffed Marilla. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll ruin her teeth and stomach. There, there,
      child, don&rsquo;t look so dismal. You can eat those, since Matthew has gone and
      got them. He&rsquo;d better have brought you peppermints. They&rsquo;re wholesomer.
      Don&rsquo;t sicken yourself eating all them at once now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, indeed, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just eat one tonight,
      Marilla. And I can give Diana half of them, can&rsquo;t I? The other half will
      taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her. It&rsquo;s delightful to think
      I have something to give her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say it for the child,&rdquo; said Marilla when Anne had gone to her
      gable, &ldquo;she isn&rsquo;t stingy. I&rsquo;m glad, for of all faults I detest stinginess
      in a child. Dear me, it&rsquo;s only three weeks since she came, and it seems as
      if she&rsquo;d been here always. I can&rsquo;t imagine the place without her. Now,
      don&rsquo;t be looking I told-you-so, Matthew. That&rsquo;s bad enough in a woman, but
      it isn&rsquo;t to be endured in a man. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to own up that I&rsquo;m
      glad I consented to keep the child and that I&rsquo;m getting fond of her, but
      don&rsquo;t you rub it in, Matthew Cuthbert.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII. The Delights of Anticipation
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T&rsquo;S time Anne was
      in to do her sewing,&rdquo; said Marilla, glancing at the clock and then out
      into the yellow August afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat.
      &ldquo;She stayed playing with Diana more than half an hour more &lsquo;n I gave her
      leave to; and now she&rsquo;s perched out there on the woodpile talking to
      Matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she knows perfectly well she ought to
      be at her work. And of course he&rsquo;s listening to her like a perfect ninny.
      I never saw such an infatuated man. The more she talks and the odder the
      things she says, the more he&rsquo;s delighted evidently. Anne Shirley, you come
      right in here this minute, do you hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A series of staccato taps on the west window brought Anne flying in from
      the yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided hair
      streaming behind her in a torrent of brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; she exclaimed breathlessly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s going to be a
      Sunday-school picnic next week&mdash;in Mr. Harmon Andrews&rsquo;s field, right
      near the lake of Shining Waters. And Mrs. Superintendent Bell and Mrs.
      Rachel Lynde are going to make ice cream&mdash;think of it, Marilla&mdash;<i>ice
      cream!</i> And, oh, Marilla, can I go to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look at the clock, if you please, Anne. What time did I tell you to
      come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;but isn&rsquo;t it splendid about the picnic, Marilla? Please
      can I go? Oh, I&rsquo;ve never been to a picnic&mdash;I&rsquo;ve dreamed of picnics,
      but I&rsquo;ve never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I told you to come at two o&rsquo;clock. And it&rsquo;s a quarter to three. I&rsquo;d
      like to know why you didn&rsquo;t obey me, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I meant to, Marilla, as much as could be. But you have no idea how
      fascinating Idlewild is. And then, of course, I had to tell Matthew about
      the picnic. Matthew is such a sympathetic listener. Please can I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to learn to resist the fascination of
      Idle-whatever-you-call-it. When I tell you to come in at a certain time I
      mean that time and not half an hour later. And you needn&rsquo;t stop to
      discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way, either. As for the
      picnic, of course you can go. You&rsquo;re a Sunday-school scholar, and it&rsquo;s not
      likely I&rsquo;d refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; faltered Anne, &ldquo;Diana says that everybody must take a
      basket of things to eat. I can&rsquo;t cook, as you know, Marilla, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much, but I&rsquo;d feel
      terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket. It&rsquo;s been preying on
      my mind ever since Diana told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it needn&rsquo;t prey any longer. I&rsquo;ll bake you a basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you dear good Marilla. Oh, you are so kind to me. Oh, I&rsquo;m so much
      obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Getting through with her &ldquo;ohs&rdquo; Anne cast herself into Marilla&rsquo;s arms and
      rapturously kissed her sallow cheek. It was the first time in her whole
      life that childish lips had voluntarily touched Marilla&rsquo;s face. Again that
      sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her. She was secretly
      vastly pleased at Anne&rsquo;s impulsive caress, which was probably the reason
      why she said brusquely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I&rsquo;d sooner see you doing
      strictly as you&rsquo;re told. As for cooking, I mean to begin giving you
      lessons in that some of these days. But you&rsquo;re so featherbrained, Anne,
      I&rsquo;ve been waiting to see if you&rsquo;d sober down a little and learn to be
      steady before I begin. You&rsquo;ve got to keep your wits about you in cooking
      and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over
      creation. Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done before
      teatime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do <i>not</i> like patchwork,&rdquo; said Anne dolefully, hunting out her
      workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds
      with a sigh. &ldquo;I think some kinds of sewing would be nice; but there&rsquo;s no
      scope for imagination in patchwork. It&rsquo;s just one little seam after
      another and you never seem to be getting anywhere. But of course I&rsquo;d
      rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any other
      place with nothing to do but play. I wish time went as quick sewing
      patches as it does when I&rsquo;m playing with Diana, though. Oh, we do have
      such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the imagination,
      but I&rsquo;m well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in every other way.
      You know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between
      our farm and Mr. Barry&rsquo;s. It belongs to Mr. William Bell, and right in the
      corner there is a little ring of white birch trees&mdash;the most romantic
      spot, Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse there. We call it Idlewild.
      Isn&rsquo;t that a poetical name? I assure you it took me some time to think it
      out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it. Then, just
      as I was dropping off to sleep, it came like an inspiration. Diana was <i>enraptured</i>
      when she heard it. We have got our house fixed up elegantly. You must come
      and see it, Marilla&mdash;won&rsquo;t you? We have great big stones, all covered
      with moss, for seats, and boards from tree to tree for shelves. And we
      have all our dishes on them. Of course, they&rsquo;re all broken but it&rsquo;s the
      easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole. There&rsquo;s a piece
      of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially
      beautiful. We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there,
      too. The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the
      woods behind their chicken house. It&rsquo;s all full of rainbows&mdash;just
      little young rainbows that haven&rsquo;t grown big yet&mdash;and Diana&rsquo;s mother
      told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had. But it&rsquo;s nice to
      imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it
      the fairy glass. Matthew is going to make us a table. Oh, we have named
      that little round pool over in Mr. Barry&rsquo;s field Willowmere. I got that
      name out of the book Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla.
      The heroine had five lovers. I&rsquo;d be satisfied with one, wouldn&rsquo;t you? She
      was very handsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint
      as easy as anything. I&rsquo;d love to be able to faint, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Marilla?
      It&rsquo;s so romantic. But I&rsquo;m really very healthy for all I&rsquo;m so thin. I
      believe I&rsquo;m getting fatter, though. Don&rsquo;t you think I am? I look at my
      elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming. Diana
      is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to wear it to
      the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I don&rsquo;t feel
      that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me
      from getting to the picnic. I suppose I&rsquo;d live through it, but I&rsquo;m certain
      it would be a lifelong sorrow. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter if I got to a hundred
      picnics in after years; they wouldn&rsquo;t make up for missing this one.
      They&rsquo;re going to have boats on the Lake of Shining Waters&mdash;and ice
      cream, as I told you. I have never tasted ice cream. Diana tried to
      explain what it was like, but I guess ice cream is one of those things
      that are beyond imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock,&rdquo; said
      Marilla. &ldquo;Now, just for curiosity&rsquo;s sake, see if you can hold your tongue
      for the same length of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne held her tongue as desired. But for the rest of the week she talked
      picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic. On Saturday it rained and
      she worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on
      raining until and over Wednesday that Marilla made her sew an extra
      patchwork square by way of steadying her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday Anne confided to Marilla on the way home from church that she
      grew actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced
      the picnic from the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a thrill as went up and down my back, Marilla! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
      ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a
      picnic. I couldn&rsquo;t help fearing I&rsquo;d only imagined it. But when a minister
      says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You set your heart too much on things, Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla, with a sigh.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;ll be a great many disappointments in store for you
      through life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Anne. &ldquo;You mayn&rsquo;t get the things themselves; but nothing can
      prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them. Mrs. Lynde
      says, &lsquo;Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be
      disappointed.&rsquo; But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be
      disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual. Marilla
      always wore her amethyst brooch to church. She would have thought it
      rather sacrilegious to leave it off&mdash;as bad as forgetting her Bible
      or her collection dime. That amethyst brooch was Marilla&rsquo;s most treasured
      possession. A seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had
      bequeathed it to Marilla. It was an old-fashioned oval, containing a braid
      of her mother&rsquo;s hair, surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts.
      Marilla knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the
      amethysts actually were; but she thought them very beautiful and was
      always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat, above
      her good brown satin dress, even although she could not see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that
      brooch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, it&rsquo;s a perfectly elegant brooch. I don&rsquo;t know how you can
      pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on. I
      couldn&rsquo;t, I know. I think amethysts are just sweet. They are what I used
      to think diamonds were like. Long ago, before I had ever seen a diamond, I
      read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like. I thought
      they would be lovely glimmering purple stones. When I saw a real diamond
      in a lady&rsquo;s ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of course, it was
      very lovely but it wasn&rsquo;t my idea of a diamond. Will you let me hold the
      brooch for one minute, Marilla? Do you think amethysts can be the souls of
      good violets?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV. Anne&rsquo;s Confession
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the Monday
      evening before the picnic Marilla came down from her room with a troubled
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the
      spotless table and singing, &ldquo;Nelly of the Hazel Dell&rdquo; with a vigor and
      expression that did credit to Diana&rsquo;s teaching, &ldquo;did you see anything of
      my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home
      from church yesterday evening, but I can&rsquo;t find it anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,&rdquo;
       said Anne, a little slowly. &ldquo;I was passing your door when I saw it on the
      cushion, so I went in to look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you touch it?&rdquo; said Marilla sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-e-e-s,&rdquo; admitted Anne, &ldquo;I took it up and I pinned it on my breast just
      to see how it would look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no business to do anything of the sort. It&rsquo;s very wrong in a
      little girl to meddle. You shouldn&rsquo;t have gone into my room in the first
      place and you shouldn&rsquo;t have touched a brooch that didn&rsquo;t belong to you in
      the second. Where did you put it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn&rsquo;t it on a minute. Truly, I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn&rsquo;t think about its being wrong to go in and
      try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I&rsquo;ll never do it again.
      That&rsquo;s one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty thing twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t put it back,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;That brooch isn&rsquo;t anywhere on the
      bureau. You&rsquo;ve taken it out or something, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did put it back,&rdquo; said Anne quickly&mdash;pertly, Marilla thought. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the
      china tray. But I&rsquo;m perfectly certain I put it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and have another look,&rdquo; said Marilla, determining to be just. &ldquo;If
      you put that brooch back it&rsquo;s there still. If it isn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll know you
      didn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the
      bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be.
      It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last person
      to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth at once.
      Did you take it out and lose it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla&rsquo;s angry gaze squarely.
      &ldquo;I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth, if I was
      to be led to the block for it&mdash;although I&rsquo;m not very certain what a
      block is. So there, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s &ldquo;so there&rdquo; was only intended to emphasize her assertion, but
      Marilla took it as a display of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;I
      know you are. There now, don&rsquo;t say anything more unless you are prepared
      to tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are
      ready to confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I take the peas with me?&rdquo; said Anne meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Anne had gone Marilla went about her evening tasks in a very
      disturbed state of mind. She was worried about her valuable brooch. What
      if Anne had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it,
      when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I wouldn&rsquo;t sooner have had happen,&rdquo; thought Marilla, as
      she nervously shelled the peas. &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t suppose she meant to
      steal it or anything like that. She&rsquo;s just taken it to play with or help
      along that imagination of hers. She must have taken it, that&rsquo;s clear, for
      there hasn&rsquo;t been a soul in that room since she was in it, by her own
      story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there&rsquo;s nothing
      surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she&rsquo;ll
      be punished. It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods. It&rsquo;s a
      far worse thing than her fit of temper. It&rsquo;s a fearful responsibility to
      have a child in your house you can&rsquo;t trust. Slyness and untruthfulness&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what she has displayed. I declare I feel worse about that than about the
      brooch. If she&rsquo;d only have told the truth about it I wouldn&rsquo;t mind so
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched
      for the brooch, without finding it. A bedtime visit to the east gable
      produced no result. Anne persisted in denying that she knew anything about
      the brooch but Marilla was only the more firmly convinced that she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told Matthew the story the next morning. Matthew was confounded and
      puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but he had to admit
      that circumstances were against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it hasn&rsquo;t fell down behind the bureau?&rdquo; was the only
      suggestion he could offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve moved the bureau and I&rsquo;ve taken out the drawers and I&rsquo;ve looked in
      every crack and cranny&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s positive answer. &ldquo;The brooch is gone
      and that child has taken it and lied about it. That&rsquo;s the plain, ugly
      truth, Matthew Cuthbert, and we might as well look it in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, what are you going to do about it?&rdquo; Matthew asked forlornly,
      feeling secretly thankful that Marilla and not he had to deal with the
      situation. He felt no desire to put his oar in this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll stay in her room until she confesses,&rdquo; said Marilla grimly,
      remembering the success of this method in the former case. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll
      see. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll be able to find the brooch if she&rsquo;ll only tell where
      she took it; but in any case she&rsquo;ll have to be severely punished,
      Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, you&rsquo;ll have to punish her,&rdquo; said Matthew, reaching for his hat.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with it, remember. You warned me off yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla felt deserted by everyone. She could not even go to Mrs. Lynde for
      advice. She went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it
      with a face more serious still. Anne steadfastly refused to confess. She
      persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch. The child had
      evidently been crying and Marilla felt a pang of pity which she sternly
      repressed. By night she was, as she expressed it, &ldquo;beat out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay in this room until you confess, Anne. You can make up your
      mind to that,&rdquo; she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the picnic is tomorrow, Marilla,&rdquo; cried Anne. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t keep me from
      going to that, will you? You&rsquo;ll just let me out for the afternoon, won&rsquo;t
      you? Then I&rsquo;ll stay here as long as you like <i>afterwards</i> cheerfully.
      But I <i>must</i> go to the picnic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you&rsquo;ve confessed, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; gasped Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Marilla had gone out and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order
      for the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies in the
      garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at
      every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits
      of benediction. The birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if
      watching for Anne&rsquo;s usual morning greeting from the east gable. But Anne
      was not at her window. When Marilla took her breakfast up to her she found
      the child sitting primly on her bed, pale and resolute, with tight-shut
      lips and gleaming eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla, I&rsquo;m ready to confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Marilla laid down her tray. Once again her method had succeeded; but
      her success was very bitter to her. &ldquo;Let me hear what you have to say
      then, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the amethyst brooch,&rdquo; said Anne, as if repeating a lesson she had
      learned. &ldquo;I took it just as you said. I didn&rsquo;t mean to take it when I went
      in. But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on my breast
      that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how
      perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was the
      Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. It would be so much easier to imagine I was the
      Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and I make
      necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts?
      So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before you came home.
      I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time. When I was
      going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch
      off to have another look at it. Oh, how it did shine in the sunlight! And
      then, when I was leaning over the bridge, it just slipped through my
      fingers&mdash;so&mdash;and went down&mdash;down&mdash;down, all
      purply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining Waters.
      And that&rsquo;s the best I can do at confessing, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla felt hot anger surge up into her heart again. This child had taken
      and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting
      the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, this is terrible,&rdquo; she said, trying to speak calmly. &ldquo;You are the
      very wickedest girl I ever heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I am,&rdquo; agreed Anne tranquilly. &ldquo;And I know I&rsquo;ll have to be
      punished. It&rsquo;ll be your duty to punish me, Marilla. Won&rsquo;t you please get
      it over right off because I&rsquo;d like to go to the picnic with nothing on my
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Picnic, indeed! You&rsquo;ll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley. That shall be
      your punishment. And it isn&rsquo;t half severe enough either for what you&rsquo;ve
      done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not go to the picnic!&rdquo; Anne sprang to her feet and clutched Marilla&rsquo;s
      hand. &ldquo;But you <i>promised</i> me I might! Oh, Marilla, I must go to the
      picnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that. Oh,
      Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice cream!
      For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla disengaged Anne&rsquo;s clinging hands stonily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t plead, Anne. You are not going to the picnic and that&rsquo;s
      final. No, not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne realized that Marilla was not to be moved. She clasped her hands
      together, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face downward on
      the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; gasped Marilla, hastening from the room. &ldquo;I believe
      the child is crazy. No child in her senses would behave as she does. If
      she isn&rsquo;t she&rsquo;s utterly bad. Oh dear, I&rsquo;m afraid Rachel was right from the
      first. But I&rsquo;ve put my hand to the plow and I won&rsquo;t look back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a dismal morning. Marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch
      floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do.
      Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it&mdash;but Marilla did. Then
      she went out and raked the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Anne. A
      tear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down to your dinner, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner, Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne, sobbingly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t eat
      anything. My heart is broken. You&rsquo;ll feel remorse of conscience someday, I
      expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you. Remember when the
      time comes that I forgive you. But please don&rsquo;t ask me to eat anything,
      especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are so
      unromantic when one is in affliction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Exasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of
      woe to Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful
      sympathy with Anne, was a miserable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, she shouldn&rsquo;t have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told stories
      about it,&rdquo; he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic
      pork and greens as if he, like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to crises
      of feeling, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s such a little thing&mdash;such an interesting
      little thing. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s pretty rough not to let her go to the
      picnic when she&rsquo;s so set on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew Cuthbert, I&rsquo;m amazed at you. I think I&rsquo;ve let her off entirely
      too easy. And she doesn&rsquo;t appear to realize how wicked she&rsquo;s been at all&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what worries me most. If she&rsquo;d really felt sorry it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad.
      And you don&rsquo;t seem to realize it, neither; you&rsquo;re making excuses for her
      all the time to yourself&mdash;I can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, she&rsquo;s such a little thing,&rdquo; feebly reiterated Matthew. &ldquo;And
      there should be allowances made, Marilla. You know she&rsquo;s never had any
      bringing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s having it now&rdquo; retorted Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him. That dinner was a
      very dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote, the
      hired boy, and Marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed
      Marilla remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black
      lace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from
      the Ladies&rsquo; Aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would go and mend it. The shawl was in a box in her trunk. As Marilla
      lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that clustered
      thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the shawl&mdash;something
      that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light. Marilla snatched at
      it with a gasp. It was the amethyst brooch, hanging to a thread of the
      lace by its catch!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear life and heart,&rdquo; said Marilla blankly, &ldquo;what does this mean? Here&rsquo;s
      my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of Barry&rsquo;s pond.
      Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it? I declare I
      believe Green Gables is bewitched. I remember now that when I took off my
      shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute. I suppose the
      brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Anne had cried
      herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley,&rdquo; said Marilla solemnly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just found my brooch hanging
      to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me
      this morning meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you said you&rsquo;d keep me here until I confessed,&rdquo; returned Anne
      wearily, &ldquo;and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the
      picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made
      it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I
      wouldn&rsquo;t forget it. But you wouldn&rsquo;t let me go to the picnic after all, so
      all my trouble was wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, you do beat all! But I was wrong&mdash;I see that now. I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have doubted your word when I&rsquo;d never known you to tell a story. Of
      course, it wasn&rsquo;t right for you to confess to a thing you hadn&rsquo;t done&mdash;it
      was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So if you&rsquo;ll forgive me,
      Anne, I&rsquo;ll forgive you and we&rsquo;ll start square again. And now get yourself
      ready for the picnic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne flew up like a rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, isn&rsquo;t it too late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only two o&rsquo;clock. They won&rsquo;t be more than well gathered yet and
      it&rsquo;ll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your hair
      and put on your gingham. I&rsquo;ll fill a basket for you. There&rsquo;s plenty of
      stuff baked in the house. And I&rsquo;ll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel and
      drive you down to the picnic ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, flying to the washstand. &ldquo;Five minutes ago
      I was so miserable I was wishing I&rsquo;d never been born and now I wouldn&rsquo;t
      change places with an angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Anne returned to Green
      Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;ve had a perfectly scrumptious time. Scrumptious is a new
      word I learned today. I heard Mary Alice Bell use it. Isn&rsquo;t it very
      expressive? Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr.
      Harmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters&mdash;six
      of us at a time. And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard. She was leaning
      out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn&rsquo;t caught her by her sash
      just in the nick of time she&rsquo;d fallen in and prob&rsquo;ly been drowned. I wish
      it had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to have been
      nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the
      ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. Marilla, I assure you
      it was sublime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Marilla told the whole story to Matthew over her stocking
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to own up that I made a mistake,&rdquo; she concluded candidly,
      &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve learned a lesson. I have to laugh when I think of Anne&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;confession,&rsquo; although I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t for it really was a
      falsehood. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem as bad as the other would have been,
      somehow, and anyhow I&rsquo;m responsible for it. That child is hard to
      understand in some respects. But I believe she&rsquo;ll turn out all right yet.
      And there&rsquo;s one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that she&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV. A Tempest in the School Teapot
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT a splendid
      day!&rdquo; said Anne, drawing a long breath. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it good just to be alive on
      a day like this? I pity the people who aren&rsquo;t born yet for missing it.
      They may have good days, of course, but they can never have this one. And
      it&rsquo;s splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty and hot,&rdquo;
       said Diana practically, peeping into her dinner basket and mentally
      calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts reposing there
      were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and to eat
      three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with one&rsquo;s best
      chum would have forever and ever branded as &ldquo;awful mean&rdquo; the girl who did
      it. And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls you just got
      enough to tantalize you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way Anne and Diana went to school <i>was</i> a pretty one. Anne
      thought those walks to and from school with Diana couldn&rsquo;t be improved
      upon even by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so
      unromantic; but to go by Lover&rsquo;s Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and
      the Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lover&rsquo;s Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched
      far up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by
      which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in
      winter. Anne had named it Lover&rsquo;s Lane before she had been a month at
      Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that lovers ever really walk there,&rdquo; she explained to Marilla, &ldquo;but
      Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there&rsquo;s a Lover&rsquo;s
      Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And it&rsquo;s a very pretty name,
      don&rsquo;t you think? So romantic! We can&rsquo;t imagine the lovers into it, you
      know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without people
      calling you crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover&rsquo;s Lane as far as
      the brook. Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on up the
      lane under the leafy arch of maples&mdash;&ldquo;maples are such sociable
      trees,&rdquo; said Anne; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re always rustling and whispering to you&rdquo;&mdash;until
      they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane and walked through
      Mr. Barry&rsquo;s back field and past Willowmere. Beyond Willowmere came Violet
      Vale&mdash;a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr. Andrew Bell&rsquo;s big
      woods. &ldquo;Of course there are no violets there now,&rdquo; Anne told Marilla, &ldquo;but
      Diana says there are millions of them in spring. Oh, Marilla, can&rsquo;t you
      just imagine you see them? It actually takes away my breath. I named it
      Violet Vale. Diana says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy
      names for places. It&rsquo;s nice to be clever at something, isn&rsquo;t it? But Diana
      named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so I let her; but I&rsquo;m sure I could
      have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path. Anybody can
      think of a name like that. But the Birch Path is one of the prettiest
      places in the world, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was. Other people besides Anne thought so when they stumbled on it. It
      was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill straight
      through Mr. Bell&rsquo;s woods, where the light came down sifted through so many
      emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond. It was
      fringed in all its length with slim young birches, white stemmed and
      lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild lilies-of-the-valley and
      scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly along it; and always there was
      a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur
      and laugh of wood winds in the trees overhead. Now and then you might see
      a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet&mdash;which, with Anne
      and Diana, happened about once in a blue moon. Down in the valley the path
      came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and wide
      in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial
      old-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their
      lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school
      children. The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a
      dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of
      milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September
      with many secret misgivings. Anne was such an odd girl. How would she get
      on with the other children? And how on earth would she ever manage to hold
      her tongue during school hours?
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went better than Marilla feared, however. Anne came home that
      evening in high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to like school here,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      much of the master, through. He&rsquo;s all the time curling his mustache and
      making eyes at Prissy Andrews. Prissy is grown up, you know. She&rsquo;s sixteen
      and she&rsquo;s studying for the entrance examination into Queen&rsquo;s Academy at
      Charlottetown next year. Tillie Boulter says the master is <i>dead gone</i>
      on her. She&rsquo;s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does
      it up so elegantly. She sits in the long seat at the back and he sits
      there, too, most of the time&mdash;to explain her lessons, he says. But
      Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate and when
      Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and Ruby Gillis
      says she doesn&rsquo;t believe it had anything to do with the lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, don&rsquo;t let me hear you talking about your teacher in that
      way again,&rdquo; said Marilla sharply. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go to school to criticize the
      master. I guess he can teach <i>you</i> something, and it&rsquo;s your business
      to learn. And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come
      home telling tales about him. That is something I won&rsquo;t encourage. I hope
      you were a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I was,&rdquo; said Anne comfortably. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so hard as you might
      imagine, either. I sit with Diana. Our seat is right by the window and we
      can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of nice girls
      in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. It&rsquo;s so nice
      to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like Diana
      best and always will. I <i>adore</i> Diana. I&rsquo;m dreadfully far behind the
      others. They&rsquo;re all in the fifth book and I&rsquo;m only in the fourth. I feel
      that it&rsquo;s kind of a disgrace. But there&rsquo;s not one of them has such an
      imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and
      geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my
      spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could
      see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have been
      politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia
      Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with &lsquo;May I see you home?&rsquo; on it. I&rsquo;m to
      give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring
      all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old
      pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Marilla, Jane
      Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy
      Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose. Marilla, that is
      the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can&rsquo;t imagine what
      a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? I know
      you&rsquo;ll tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nose is well enough,&rdquo; said Marilla shortly. Secretly she thought
      Anne&rsquo;s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of
      telling her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this
      crisp September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the
      Birch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
      visiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came
      home Saturday night. He&rsquo;s <i>aw&rsquo;fly</i> handsome, Anne. And he teases the
      girls something terrible. He just torments our lives out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana&rsquo;s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented
      out than not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe?&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t his name that&rsquo;s written up on the
      porch wall with Julia Bell&rsquo;s and a big &lsquo;Take Notice&rsquo; over them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Diana, tossing her head, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t like Julia
      Bell so very much. I&rsquo;ve heard him say he studied the multiplication table
      by her freckles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak about freckles to me,&rdquo; implored Anne. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t delicate
      when I&rsquo;ve got so many. But I do think that writing take-notices up on the
      wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. I should just like to
      see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy&rsquo;s. Not, of course,&rdquo; she
      hastened to add, &ldquo;that anybody would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne sighed. She didn&rsquo;t want her name written up. But it was a little
      humiliating to know that there was no danger of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played
      such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured on
      the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only meant as a joke.
      And don&rsquo;t you be too sure your name won&rsquo;t ever be written up. Charlie
      Sloane is <i>dead gone</i> on you. He told his mother&mdash;his <i>mother</i>,
      mind you&mdash;that you were the smartest girl in school. That&rsquo;s better
      than being good looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne, feminine to the core. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be pretty
      than clever. And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can&rsquo;t bear a boy with goggle
      eyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his I&rsquo;d never <i>get</i> over it,
      Diana Barry. But it <i>is</i> nice to keep head of your class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have Gilbert in your class after this,&rdquo; said Diana, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s used
      to being head of his class, I can tell you. He&rsquo;s only in the fourth book
      although he&rsquo;s nearly fourteen. Four years ago his father was sick and had
      to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him. They were
      there three years and Gil didn&rsquo;t go to school hardly any until they came
      back. You won&rsquo;t find it so easy to keep head after this, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; said Anne quickly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t really feel proud of keeping
      head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got up yesterday
      spelling &lsquo;ebullition.&rsquo; Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she peeped in her
      book. Mr. Phillips didn&rsquo;t see her&mdash;he was looking at Prissy Andrews&mdash;but
      I did. I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a
      beet and spelled it wrong after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those Pye girls are cheats all round,&rdquo; said Diana indignantly, as they
      climbed the fence of the main road. &ldquo;Gertie Pye actually went and put her
      milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I don&rsquo;t
      speak to her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews&rsquo;s
      Latin, Diana whispered to Anne, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gilbert Blythe sitting right
      across the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him and see if you don&rsquo;t
      think he&rsquo;s handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said
      Gilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of
      Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He was a
      tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth twisted
      into a teasing smile. Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take a sum to
      the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek, believing
      that her hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at her and Mr.
      Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry. Gilbert had whisked the
      pin out of sight and was studying his history with the soberest face in
      the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at Anne and winked
      with inexpressible drollery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your Gilbert Blythe <i>is</i> handsome,&rdquo; confided Anne to Diana,
      &ldquo;but I think he&rsquo;s very bold. It isn&rsquo;t good manners to wink at a strange
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to
      Prissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they
      pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their slates,
      and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle. Gilbert
      Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing utterly,
      because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only to the very
      existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in Avonlea school
      itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes fixed on the blue
      glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west window afforded, she
      was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her
      own wonderful visions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Blythe wasn&rsquo;t used to putting himself out to make a girl look at
      him and meeting with failure. She <i>should</i> look at him, that
      red-haired Shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that
      weren&rsquo;t like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne&rsquo;s long red
      braid, held it out at arm&rsquo;s length and said in a piercing whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carrots! Carrots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Anne looked at him with a vengeance!
    </p>
    <p>
      She did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies fallen
      into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert from eyes
      whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, hateful boy!&rdquo; she exclaimed passionately. &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert&rsquo;s head
      and cracked it&mdash;slate not head&mdash;clear across.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable
      one. Everybody said &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby Gillis,
      who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy Sloane let his team
      of crickets escape him altogether while he stared open-mouthed at the
      tableau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, what does this mean?&rdquo; he said angrily. Anne returned no
      answer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell
      before the whole school that she had been called &ldquo;carrots.&rdquo; Gilbert it was
      who spoke up stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a
      vindictive spirit,&rdquo; he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of being
      a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts of
      small imperfect mortals. &ldquo;Anne, go and stand on the platform in front of
      the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under
      which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white, set
      face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the
      blackboard above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control her
      temper,&rdquo; and then read it out loud so that even the primer class, who
      couldn&rsquo;t read writing, should understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her. She
      did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart for
      that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With
      resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana&rsquo;s
      sympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane&rsquo;s indignant nods and Josie Pye&rsquo;s
      malicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.
      She would <i>never</i> look at him again! She would never speak to him!!
    </p>
    <p>
      When school was dismissed Anne marched out with her red head held high.
      Gilbert Blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Anne,&rdquo; he whispered
      contritely. &ldquo;Honest I am. Don&rsquo;t be mad for keeps, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. &ldquo;Oh how could
      you, Anne?&rdquo; breathed Diana as they went down the road half reproachfully,
      half admiringly. Diana felt that <i>she</i> could never have resisted
      Gilbert&rsquo;s plea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe,&rdquo; said Anne firmly. &ldquo;And Mr.
      Phillips spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered into my
      soul, Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana hadn&rsquo;t the least idea what Anne meant but she understood it was
      something terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind Gilbert making fun of your hair,&rdquo; she said soothingly.
      &ldquo;Why, he makes fun of all the girls. He laughs at mine because it&rsquo;s so
      black. He&rsquo;s called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him
      apologize for anything before, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being
      called carrots,&rdquo; said Anne with dignity. &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe has hurt my
      feelings <i>excruciatingly</i>, Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation
      if nothing else had happened. But when things begin to happen they are apt
      to keep on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell&rsquo;s spruce
      grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they
      could keep an eye on Eben Wright&rsquo;s house, where the master boarded. When
      they saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse; but
      the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright&rsquo;s lane they
      were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three minutes
      too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic
      fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should
      expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone
      who came in late would be punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell&rsquo;s spruce grove as
      usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to &ldquo;pick a chew.&rdquo; But
      spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they picked
      and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that recalled them
      to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting from the top of
      a patriarchal old spruce &ldquo;Master&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the
      schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to
      wriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not
      been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the
      grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a
      wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the
      shadowy places, was latest of all. Anne could run like a deer, however;
      run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys at the door
      and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr. Phillips was in
      the act of hanging up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips&rsquo;s brief reforming energy was over; he didn&rsquo;t want the bother
      of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something to save
      his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in Anne, who had
      dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a forgotten lily wreath
      hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and
      disheveled appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys&rsquo; company we shall
      indulge your taste for it this afternoon,&rdquo; he said sarcastically. &ldquo;Take
      those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boys snickered. Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the
      wreath from Anne&rsquo;s hair and squeezed her hand. Anne stared at the master
      as if turned to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what I said, Anne?&rdquo; queried Mr. Phillips sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Anne slowly &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t suppose you really meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I did&rdquo;&mdash;still with the sarcastic inflection which all
      the children, and Anne especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. &ldquo;Obey me
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey. Then, realizing that
      there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the aisle,
      sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms on the
      desk. Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down, told the
      others going home from school that she&rsquo;d &ldquo;acksually never seen anything
      like it&mdash;it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Anne, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be
      singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it was
      worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be
      Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly
      unbearable. Anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use
      to try. Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.
      But as Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if
      his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned to
      their own tasks and Anne was forgotten. When Mr. Phillips called the
      history class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and Mr.
      Phillips, who had been writing some verses &ldquo;To Priscilla&rdquo; before he called
      the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed
      her. Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk a little
      pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, &ldquo;You are sweet,&rdquo; and slipped it
      under the curve of Anne&rsquo;s arm. Whereupon Anne arose, took the pink heart
      gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground
      it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position without deigning
      to bestow a glance on Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      When school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out
      everything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and
      arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?&rdquo; Diana wanted to
      know, as soon as they were out on the road. She had not dared to ask the
      question before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not coming back to school any more,&rdquo; said Anne. Diana gasped and
      stared at Anne to see if she meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Marilla let you stay home?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> go to school to that man
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anne!&rdquo; Diana looked as if she were ready to cry. &ldquo;I do think you&rsquo;re
      mean. What shall I do? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid
      Gertie Pye&mdash;I know he will because she is sitting alone. Do come
      back, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do almost anything in the world for you, Diana,&rdquo; said Anne sadly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I
      can&rsquo;t do this, so please don&rsquo;t ask it. You harrow up my very soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of all the fun you will miss,&rdquo; mourned Diana. &ldquo;We are going to
      build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we&rsquo;ll be playing ball
      next week and you&rsquo;ve never played ball, Anne. It&rsquo;s tremendously exciting.
      And we&rsquo;re going to learn a new song&mdash;Jane Andrews is practicing it up
      now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy book next week and
      we&rsquo;re all going to read it out loud, chapter about, down by the brook. And
      you know you are so fond of reading out loud, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing moved Anne in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go to
      school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t nonsense at all,&rdquo; said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn,
      reproachful eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, Marilla? I&rsquo;ve been insulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insulted fiddlesticks! You&rsquo;ll go to school tomorrow as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; Anne shook her head gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back, Marilla. I&rsquo;ll
      learn my lessons at home and I&rsquo;ll be as good as I can be and hold my
      tongue all the time if it&rsquo;s possible at all. But I will not go back to
      school, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out
      of Anne&rsquo;s small face. She understood that she would have trouble in
      overcoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,&rdquo; she thought.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use reasoning with Anne now. She&rsquo;s too worked up and I&rsquo;ve an
      idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can make
      out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a rather
      high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I&rsquo;ll just talk it over
      with Rachel. She&rsquo;s sent ten children to school and she ought to know
      something about it. She&rsquo;ll have heard the whole story, too, by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully
      as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know what I&rsquo;ve come about,&rdquo; she said, a little
      shamefacedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Anne&rsquo;s fuss in school, I reckon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tillie Boulter was in
      on her way home from school and told me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do with her,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;She declares she won&rsquo;t
      go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I&rsquo;ve been expecting
      trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were going too
      smooth to last. She&rsquo;s so high strung. What would you advise, Rachel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;ve asked my advice, Marilla,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde amiably&mdash;Mrs.
      Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just humor her a
      little at first, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do. It&rsquo;s my belief that Mr. Phillips was
      in the wrong. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t do to say so to the children, you
      know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to
      temper. But today it was different. The others who were late should have
      been punished as well as Anne, that&rsquo;s what. And I don&rsquo;t believe in making
      the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It isn&rsquo;t modest. Tillie
      Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne&rsquo;s part right through and said
      all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular among them, somehow. I
      never thought she&rsquo;d take with them so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really think I&rsquo;d better let her stay home,&rdquo; said Marilla in
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is I wouldn&rsquo;t say school to her again until she said it
      herself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she&rsquo;ll cool off in a week or so and be
      ready enough to go back of her own accord, that&rsquo;s what, while, if you were
      to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum she&rsquo;d take
      next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the better, in my
      opinion. She won&rsquo;t miss much by not going to school, as far as <i>that</i>
      goes. Mr. Phillips isn&rsquo;t any good at all as a teacher. The order he keeps
      is scandalous, that&rsquo;s what, and he neglects the young fry and puts all his
      time on those big scholars he&rsquo;s getting ready for Queen&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d never have
      got the school for another year if his uncle hadn&rsquo;t been a trustee&mdash;<i>the</i>
      trustee, for he just leads the other two around by the nose, that&rsquo;s what.
      I declare, I don&rsquo;t know what education in this Island is coming to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the head
      of the educational system of the Province things would be much better
      managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla took Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s advice and not another word was said to Anne
      about going back to school. She learned her lessons at home, did her
      chores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights; but
      when she met Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him in Sunday
      school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by
      his evident desire to appease her. Even Diana&rsquo;s efforts as a peacemaker
      were of no avail. Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert
      Blythe to the end of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the
      love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and
      dislikes. One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket of
      apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight,
      crying bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s the matter now, Anne?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Diana,&rdquo; sobbed Anne luxuriously. &ldquo;I love Diana so, Marilla. I
      cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up that
      Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall I do?
      I hate her husband&mdash;I just hate him furiously. I&rsquo;ve been imagining it
      all out&mdash;the wedding and everything&mdash;Diana dressed in snowy
      garments, with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and
      me the bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a
      breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Diana
      goodbye-e-e&mdash;&rdquo; Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no use;
      she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and
      unusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted
      in amazement. When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Anne Shirley,&rdquo; said Marilla as soon as she could speak, &ldquo;if you
      must borrow trouble, for pity&rsquo;s sake borrow it handier home. I should
      think you had an imagination, sure enough.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI. Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>CTOBER was a
      beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as
      golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson
      and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of
      dark red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned themselves in
      aftermaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne reveled in the world of color about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with
      her arms full of gorgeous boughs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I live in a world where
      there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September
      to November, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Look at these maple branches. Don&rsquo;t they give
      you a thrill&mdash;several thrills? I&rsquo;m going to decorate my room with
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messy things,&rdquo; said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably
      developed. &ldquo;You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors
      stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, and dream in too, Marilla. And you know one can dream so much better
      in a room where there are pretty things. I&rsquo;m going to put these boughs in
      the old blue jug and set them on my table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t drop leaves all over the stairs then. I&rsquo;m going on a
      meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I won&rsquo;t
      likely be home before dark. You&rsquo;ll have to get Matthew and Jerry their
      supper, so mind you don&rsquo;t forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down
      at the table as you did last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was dreadful of me to forget,&rdquo; said Anne apologetically, &ldquo;but that was
      the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it
      crowded other things out. Matthew was so good. He never scolded a bit. He
      put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not. And
      I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he didn&rsquo;t find
      the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story, Marilla. I forgot
      the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and Matthew said he
      couldn&rsquo;t tell where the join came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up
      and have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about
      you this time. And&mdash;I don&rsquo;t really know if I&rsquo;m doing right&mdash;it
      may make you more addlepated than ever&mdash;but you can ask Diana to come
      over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla!&rdquo; Anne clasped her hands. &ldquo;How perfectly lovely! You <i>are</i>
      able to imagine things after all or else you&rsquo;d never have understood how
      I&rsquo;ve longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and grown-uppish. No
      fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company. Oh,
      Marilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! The rosebud tea set! Well, what next? You know I never use
      that except for the minister or the Aids. You&rsquo;ll put down the old brown
      tea set. But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves.
      It&rsquo;s time it was being used anyhow&mdash;I believe it&rsquo;s beginning to work.
      And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and
      pouring out the tea,&rdquo; said Anne, shutting her eyes ecstatically. &ldquo;And
      asking Diana if she takes sugar! I know she doesn&rsquo;t but of course I&rsquo;ll ask
      her just as if I didn&rsquo;t know. And then pressing her to take another piece
      of fruit cake and another helping of preserves. Oh, Marilla, it&rsquo;s a
      wonderful sensation just to think of it. Can I take her into the spare
      room to lay off her hat when she comes? And then into the parlor to sit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The sitting room will do for you and your company. But there&rsquo;s a
      bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church
      social the other night. It&rsquo;s on the second shelf of the sitting-room
      closet and you and Diana can have it if you like, and a cooky to eat with
      it along in the afternoon, for I daresay Matthew &lsquo;ll be late coming in to
      tea since he&rsquo;s hauling potatoes to the vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne flew down to the hollow, past the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble and up the spruce
      path to Orchard Slope, to ask Diana to tea. As a result just after Marilla
      had driven off to Carmody, Diana came over, dressed in <i>her</i>
      second-best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked
      out to tea. At other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without
      knocking; but now she knocked primly at the front door. And when Anne,
      dressed in her second best, as primly opened it, both little girls shook
      hands as gravely as if they had never met before. This unnatural solemnity
      lasted until after Diana had been taken to the east gable to lay off her
      hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room, toes in
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is your mother?&rdquo; inquired Anne politely, just as if she had not seen
      Mrs. Barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very well, thank you. I suppose Mr. Cuthbert is hauling potatoes
      to the <i>lily sands</i> this afternoon, is he?&rdquo; said Diana, who had
      ridden down to Mr. Harmon Andrews&rsquo;s that morning in Matthew&rsquo;s cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Our potato crop is very good this year. I hope your father&rsquo;s crop is
      good too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fairly good, thank you. Have you picked many of your apples yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ever so many,&rdquo; said Anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up
      quickly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings,
      Diana. Marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree. Marilla is
      a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and cherry
      preserves for tea. But it isn&rsquo;t good manners to tell your company what you
      are going to give them to eat, so I won&rsquo;t tell you what she said we could
      have to drink. Only it begins with an R and a C and it&rsquo;s bright red color.
      I love bright red drinks, don&rsquo;t you? They taste twice as good as any other
      color.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with
      fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the
      afternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the
      green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples and
      talking as hard as they could. Diana had much to tell Anne of what went on
      in school. She had to sit with Gertie Pye and she hated it; Gertie
      squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made her&mdash;Diana&rsquo;s&mdash;blood
      run cold; Ruby Gillis had charmed all her warts away, true&rsquo;s you live,
      with a magic pebble that old Mary Joe from the Creek gave her. You had to
      rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left
      shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go. Charlie
      Sloane&rsquo;s name was written up with Em White&rsquo;s on the porch wall and Em
      White was <i>awful mad</i> about it; Sam Boulter had &ldquo;sassed&rdquo; Mr. Phillips
      in class and Mr. Phillips whipped him and Sam&rsquo;s father came down to the
      school and dared Mr. Phillips to lay a hand on one of his children again;
      and Mattie Andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on
      it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening; and Lizzie
      Wright didn&rsquo;t speak to Mamie Wilson because Mamie Wilson&rsquo;s grown-up sister
      had cut out Lizzie Wright&rsquo;s grown-up sister with her beau; and everybody
      missed Anne so and wished she&rsquo;s come to school again; and Gilbert Blythe&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anne didn&rsquo;t want to hear about Gilbert Blythe. She jumped up hurriedly
      and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle
      of raspberry cordial there. Search revealed it away back on the top shelf.
      Anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, please help yourself, Diana,&rdquo; she said politely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
      I&rsquo;ll have any just now. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I wanted any after all those
      apples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue
      admiringly, and then sipped it daintily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfully nice raspberry cordial, Anne,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
      raspberry cordial was so nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real glad you like it. Take as much as you want. I&rsquo;m going to run out
      and stir the fire up. There are so many responsibilities on a person&rsquo;s
      mind when they&rsquo;re keeping house, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Anne came back from the kitchen Diana was drinking her second
      glassful of cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Anne, she offered no
      particular objection to the drinking of a third. The tumblerfuls were
      generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nicest I ever drank,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ever so much nicer than Mrs.
      Lynde&rsquo;s, although she brags of hers so much. It doesn&rsquo;t taste a bit like
      hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think Marilla&rsquo;s raspberry cordial would prob&rsquo;ly be much nicer
      than Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Anne loyally. &ldquo;Marilla is a famous cook. She is
      trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work.
      There&rsquo;s so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go by
      rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I was
      thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you were
      desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I went
      boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took the
      smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the
      graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your
      tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed
      her life for you. Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Diana. The tears just
      rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But I forgot the flour
      and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so essential to cakes, you
      know. Marilla was very cross and I don&rsquo;t wonder. I&rsquo;m a great trial to her.
      She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week. We had a
      plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a
      pitcherful of sauce left over. Marilla said there was enough for another
      dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it. I meant to
      cover it just as much as could be, Diana, but when I carried it in I was
      imagining I was a nun&mdash;of course I&rsquo;m a Protestant but I imagined I
      was a Catholic&mdash;taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered
      seclusion; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce. I thought of
      it next morning and ran to the pantry. Diana, fancy if you can my extreme
      horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce! I lifted the
      mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the
      spoon in three waters. Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask
      her when she came in if I&rsquo;d give the sauce to the pigs; but when she did
      come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods
      turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be, so I never
      thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick
      apples. Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that
      morning. You know they are very stylish people, especially Mrs. Chester
      Ross. When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at
      the table. I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be, for I
      wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I
      wasn&rsquo;t pretty. Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the
      plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce <i>warmed up</i>,
      in the other. Diana, that was a terrible moment. I remembered everything
      and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out &lsquo;Marilla, you mustn&rsquo;t use
      that pudding sauce. There was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you
      before.&rsquo; Oh, Diana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be
      a hundred. Mrs. Chester Ross just <i>looked</i> at me and I thought I
      would sink through the floor with mortification. She is such a perfect
      housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us. Marilla turned red
      as fire but she never said a word&mdash;then. She just carried that sauce
      and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves. She even offered
      me some, but I couldn&rsquo;t swallow a mouthful. It was like heaping coals of
      fire on my head. After Mrs. Chester Ross went away, Marilla gave me a
      dreadful scolding. Why, Diana, what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her
      hands to her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m awful sick,&rdquo; she said, a little thickly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;must
      go right home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t dream of going home without your tea,&rdquo; cried Anne in
      distress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it right off&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go and put the tea down this
      very minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go home,&rdquo; repeated Diana, stupidly but determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get you a lunch anyhow,&rdquo; implored Anne. &ldquo;Let me give you a bit of
      fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa for a
      little while and you&rsquo;ll be better. Where do you feel bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go home,&rdquo; said Diana, and that was all she would say. In vain Anne
      pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of company going home without tea,&rdquo; she mourned. &ldquo;Oh,
      Diana, do you suppose that it&rsquo;s possible you&rsquo;re really taking the
      smallpox? If you are I&rsquo;ll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. I&rsquo;ll
      never forsake you. But I do wish you&rsquo;d stay till after tea. Where do you
      feel bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful dizzy,&rdquo; said Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, she walked very dizzily. Anne, with tears of disappointment in
      her eyes, got Diana&rsquo;s hat and went with her as far as the Barry yard
      fence. Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she
      sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the
      pantry and got tea ready for Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone out
      of the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn
      till dusk Anne did not stir abroad from Green Gables. Monday afternoon
      Marilla sent her down to Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s on an errand. In a very short space
      of time Anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her
      cheeks. Into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the
      sofa in an agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?&rdquo; queried Marilla in doubt and dismay.
      &ldquo;I do hope you haven&rsquo;t gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered. Sit right
      up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne sat up, tragedy personified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an awful
      state,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;She says that I set Diana <i>drunk</i> Saturday and
      sent her home in a disgraceful condition. And she says I must be a
      thoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she&rsquo;s never, never going to let
      Diana play with me again. Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;m just overcome with woe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla stared in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set Diana drunk!&rdquo; she said when she found her voice. &ldquo;Anne are you or
      Mrs. Barry crazy? What on earth did you give her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing but raspberry cordial,&rdquo; sobbed Anne. &ldquo;I never thought
      raspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla&mdash;not even if they
      drank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did. Oh, it sounds so&mdash;so&mdash;like
      Mrs. Thomas&rsquo;s husband! But I didn&rsquo;t mean to set her drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drunk fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said Marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry.
      There on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one
      containing some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which she
      was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort, Mrs.
      Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. And at the same time Marilla
      recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the
      cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. Her face
      was twitching in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. You went and
      gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. Didn&rsquo;t you know the
      difference yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never tasted it,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I thought it was the cordial. I meant to
      be so&mdash;so&mdash;hospitable. Diana got awfully sick and had to go
      home. Mrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk. She just
      laughed silly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went
      to sleep and slept for hours. Her mother smelled her breath and knew she
      was drunk. She had a fearful headache all day yesterday. Mrs. Barry is so
      indignant. She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to
      drink three glassfuls of anything,&rdquo; said Marilla shortly. &ldquo;Why, three of
      those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been
      cordial. Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so
      down on me for making currant wine, although I haven&rsquo;t made any for three
      years ever since I found out that the minister didn&rsquo;t approve. I just kept
      that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don&rsquo;t cry. I can&rsquo;t see as
      you were to blame although I&rsquo;m sorry it happened so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must cry,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;My heart is broken. The stars in their courses
      fight against me, Marilla. Diana and I are parted forever. Oh, Marilla, I
      little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Anne. Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she finds
      you&rsquo;re not to blame. I suppose she thinks you&rsquo;ve done it for a silly joke
      or something of that sort. You&rsquo;d best go up this evening and tell her how
      it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana&rsquo;s injured mother,&rdquo;
       sighed Anne. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d go, Marilla. You&rsquo;re so much more dignified than
      I am. Likely she&rsquo;d listen to you quicker than to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will,&rdquo; said Marilla, reflecting that it would probably be the
      wiser course. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry any more, Anne. It will be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got
      back from Orchard Slope. Anne was watching for her coming and flew to the
      porch door to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, I know by your face that it&rsquo;s been no use,&rdquo; she said
      sorrowfully. &ldquo;Mrs. Barry won&rsquo;t forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Barry indeed!&rdquo; snapped Marilla. &ldquo;Of all the unreasonable women I
      ever saw she&rsquo;s the worst. I told her it was all a mistake and you weren&rsquo;t
      to blame, but she just simply didn&rsquo;t believe me. And she rubbed it well in
      about my currant wine and how I&rsquo;d always said it couldn&rsquo;t have the least
      effect on anybody. I just told her plainly that currant wine wasn&rsquo;t meant
      to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child I had to do
      with was so greedy I&rsquo;d sober her up with a right good spanking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very
      much distracted little soul in the porch behind her. Presently Anne
      stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and
      steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the log
      bridge and up through the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little moon
      hanging low over the western woods. Mrs. Barry, coming to the door in
      answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on the
      doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face hardened. Mrs. Barry was a woman of strong prejudices and
      dislikes, and her anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always
      hardest to overcome. To do her justice, she really believed Anne had made
      Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she was honestly anxious to
      preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy
      with such a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she said stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me. I did not mean to&mdash;to&mdash;intoxicate
      Diana. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl
      that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the
      world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? I thought it was
      only raspberry cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial.
      Oh, please don&rsquo;t say that you won&rsquo;t let Diana play with me any more. If
      you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech which would have softened good Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s heart in a
      twinkling, had no effect on Mrs. Barry except to irritate her still more.
      She was suspicious of Anne&rsquo;s big words and dramatic gestures and imagined
      that the child was making fun of her. So she said, coldly and cruelly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with.
      You&rsquo;d better go home and behave yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s lips quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me see Diana just once to say farewell?&rdquo; she implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana has gone over to Carmody with her father,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barry, going
      in and shutting the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne went back to Green Gables calm with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My last hope is gone,&rdquo; she told Marilla. &ldquo;I went up and saw Mrs. Barry
      myself and she treated me very insultingly. Marilla, I do <i>not</i> think
      she is a well-bred woman. There is nothing more to do except to pray and I
      haven&rsquo;t much hope that that&rsquo;ll do much good because, Marilla, I do not
      believe that God Himself can do very much with such an obstinate person as
      Mrs. Barry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, you shouldn&rsquo;t say such things&rdquo; rebuked Marilla, striving to
      overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find
      growing upon her. And indeed, when she told the whole story to Matthew
      that night, she did laugh heartily over Anne&rsquo;s tribulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found
      that Anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little soul,&rdquo; she murmured, lifting a loose curl of hair from the
      child&rsquo;s tear-stained face. Then she bent down and kissed the flushed cheek
      on the pillow.

      CHAPTER XVII. A New Interest in Life
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next afternoon
      Anne, bending over her patchwork at the kitchen window, happened to glance
      out and beheld Diana down by the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble beckoning mysteriously. In
      a trice Anne was out of the house and flying down to the hollow,
      astonishment and hope struggling in her expressive eyes. But the hope
      faded when she saw Diana&rsquo;s dejected countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother hasn&rsquo;t relented?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diana shook her head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and oh, Anne, she says I&rsquo;m never to play with you again. I&rsquo;ve cried
      and cried and I told her it wasn&rsquo;t your fault, but it wasn&rsquo;t any use. I
      had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to
      you. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she&rsquo;s timing me by the
      clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes isn&rsquo;t very long to say an eternal farewell in,&rdquo; said Anne
      tearfully. &ldquo;Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget me, the
      friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; sobbed Diana, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll never have another bosom friend&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t want to have. I couldn&rsquo;t love anybody as I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana,&rdquo; cried Anne, clasping her hands, &ldquo;do you <i>love</i> me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I do. Didn&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Anne drew a long breath. &ldquo;I thought you <i>liked</i> me of course
      but I never hoped you <i>loved</i> me. Why, Diana, I didn&rsquo;t think anybody
      could love me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is
      wonderful! It&rsquo;s a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of
      a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you devotedly, Anne,&rdquo; said Diana stanchly, &ldquo;and I always will, you
      may be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will always love thee, Diana,&rdquo; said Anne, solemnly extending her
      hand. &ldquo;In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my
      lonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt thou
      give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure
      forevermore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got anything to cut it with?&rdquo; queried Diana, wiping away the
      tears which Anne&rsquo;s affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and
      returning to practicalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,&rdquo; said
      Anne. She solemnly clipped one of Diana&rsquo;s curls. &ldquo;Fare thee well, my
      beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side by
      side. But my heart will ever be faithful to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her hand to
      the latter whenever she turned to look back. Then she returned to the
      house, not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all over,&rdquo; she informed Marilla. &ldquo;I shall never have another
      friend. I&rsquo;m really worse off than ever before, for I haven&rsquo;t Katie Maurice
      and Violetta now. And even if I had it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same. Somehow,
      little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend. Diana and I had
      such an affecting farewell down by the spring. It will be sacred in my
      memory forever. I used the most pathetic language I could think of and
      said &lsquo;thou&rsquo; and &lsquo;thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou&rsquo; and &lsquo;thee&rsquo; seem so much more romantic than
      &lsquo;you.&rsquo; Diana gave me a lock of her hair and I&rsquo;m going to sew it up in a
      little bag and wear it around my neck all my life. Please see that it is
      buried with me, for I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll live very long. Perhaps when she
      sees me lying cold and dead before her Mrs. Barry may feel remorse for
      what she has done and will let Diana come to my funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you
      can talk, Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla unsympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Monday Anne surprised Marilla by coming down from her room
      with her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into a
      line of determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to school,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;That is all there is left in
      life for me, now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me. In
      school I can look at her and muse over days departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better muse over your lessons and sums,&rdquo; said Marilla, concealing
      her delight at this development of the situation. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going back to
      school I hope we&rsquo;ll hear no more of breaking slates over people&rsquo;s heads
      and such carryings on. Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be a model pupil,&rdquo; agreed Anne dolefully. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be
      much fun in it, I expect. Mr. Phillips said Minnie Andrews was a model
      pupil and there isn&rsquo;t a spark of imagination or life in her. She is just
      dull and poky and never seems to have a good time. But I feel so depressed
      that perhaps it will come easy to me now. I&rsquo;m going round by the road. I
      couldn&rsquo;t bear to go by the Birch Path all alone. I should weep bitter
      tears if I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne was welcomed back to school with open arms. Her imagination had been
      sorely missed in games, her voice in the singing and her dramatic ability
      in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour. Ruby Gillis smuggled three
      blue plums over to her during testament reading; Ella May MacPherson gave
      her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue&mdash;a
      species of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea school. Sophia Sloane
      offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace, so nice
      for trimming aprons. Katie Boulter gave her a perfume bottle to keep slate
      water in, and Julia Bell copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper
      scalloped on the edges the following effusion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When twilight drops her curtain down
  And pins it with a star
  Remember that you have a friend
  Though she may wander far.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice to be appreciated,&rdquo; sighed Anne rapturously to Marilla that
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls were not the only scholars who &ldquo;appreciated&rdquo; her. When Anne went
      to her seat after dinner hour&mdash;she had been told by Mr. Phillips to
      sit with the model Minnie Andrews&mdash;she found on her desk a big
      luscious &ldquo;strawberry apple.&rdquo; Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite
      when she remembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples
      grew was in the old Blythe orchard on the other side of the Lake of
      Shining Waters. Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and
      ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief. The apple lay
      untouched on her desk until the next morning, when little Timothy Andrews,
      who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one of his
      perquisites. Charlie Sloane&rsquo;s slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened with
      striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary pencils
      cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met with a more
      favorable reception. Anne was graciously pleased to accept it and rewarded
      the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated youth straightway
      into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to make such fearful
      errors in his dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him in after school to
      rewrite it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The Caesar&rsquo;s pageant shorn of Brutus&rsquo; bust
  Did but of Rome&rsquo;s best son remind her more,
</pre>
    <p>
      so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from Diana Barry who
      was sitting with Gertie Pye embittered Anne&rsquo;s little triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana might just have smiled at me once, I think,&rdquo; she mourned to Marilla
      that night. But the next morning a note most fearfully and wonderfully
      twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Anne (ran the former)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother says I&rsquo;m not to play with you or talk to you even in school. It
      isn&rsquo;t my fault and don&rsquo;t be cross at me, because I love you as much as
      ever. I miss you awfully to tell all my secrets to and I don&rsquo;t like Gertie
      Pye one bit. I made you one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue
      paper. They are awfully fashionable now and only three girls in school
      know how to make them. When you look at it remember
    </p>
    <p>
      Your true friend
    </p>
    <p>
      Diana Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply
      back to the other side of the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own darling Diana:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother. Our
      spirits can commune. I shall keep your lovely present forever. Minnie
      Andrews is a very nice little girl&mdash;although she has no imagination&mdash;but
      after having been Diana&rsquo;s busum friend I cannot be Minnie&rsquo;s. Please excuse
      mistakes because my spelling isn&rsquo;t very good yet, although much improoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours until death us do part
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne or Cordelia Shirley.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S. I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight. A. <i>or</i>
      C.S.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since Anne had again begun
      to go to school. But none developed. Perhaps Anne caught something of the
      &ldquo;model&rdquo; spirit from Minnie Andrews; at least she got on very well with Mr.
      Phillips thenceforth. She flung herself into her studies heart and soul,
      determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe. The rivalry
      between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured on Gilbert&rsquo;s
      side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of
      Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges.
      She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. She would not stoop to
      admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork, because that would
      have been to acknowledge his existence which Anne persistently ignored;
      but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated between them. Now Gilbert
      was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with a toss of her long red
      braids, spelled him down. One morning Gilbert had all his sums done
      correctly and had his name written on the blackboard on the roll of honor;
      the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with decimals the entire
      evening before, would be first. One awful day they were ties and their
      names were written up together. It was almost as bad as a take-notice and
      Anne&rsquo;s mortification was as evident as Gilbert&rsquo;s satisfaction. When the
      written examinations at the end of each month were held the suspense was
      terrible. The first month Gilbert came out three marks ahead. The second
      Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was marred by the fact that Gilbert
      congratulated her heartily before the whole school. It would have been
      ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly
      determined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress
      under any kind of teacher. By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were
      both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the
      elements of &ldquo;the branches&rdquo;&mdash;by which Latin, geometry, French, and
      algebra were meant. In geometry Anne met her Waterloo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly awful stuff, Marilla,&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll never
      be able to make head or tail of it. There is no scope for imagination in
      it at all. Mr. Phillips says I&rsquo;m the worst dunce he ever saw at it. And
      Gil&mdash;I mean some of the others are so smart at it. It is extremely
      mortifying, Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even Diana gets along better than I do. But I don&rsquo;t mind being beaten by
      Diana. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with an <i>inextinguishable</i>
      love. It makes me very sad at times to think about her. But really,
      Marilla, one can&rsquo;t stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can
      one?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII. Anne to the Rescue
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL things great
      are wound up with all things little. At first glance it might not seem
      that the decision of a certain Canadian Premier to include Prince Edward
      Island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the
      fortunes of little Anne Shirley at Green Gables. But it had.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a January the Premier came, to address his loyal supporters and
      such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass
      meeting held in Charlottetown. Most of the Avonlea people were on
      Premier&rsquo;s side of politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly all
      the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty miles
      away. Mrs. Rachel Lynde had gone too. Mrs. Rachel Lynde was a red-hot
      politician and couldn&rsquo;t have believed that the political rally could be
      carried through without her, although she was on the opposite side of
      politics. So she went to town and took her husband&mdash;Thomas would be
      useful in looking after the horse&mdash;and Marilla Cuthbert with her.
      Marilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself, and as she thought it
      might be her only chance to see a real live Premier, she promptly took it,
      leaving Anne and Matthew to keep house until her return the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely at
      the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green
      Gables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned
      Waterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the
      windowpanes. Matthew nodded over a <i>Farmers&rsquo; Advocate</i> on the sofa
      and Anne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite
      sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that Jane
      Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was warranted
      to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and Anne&rsquo;s
      fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert Blythe&rsquo;s
      triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf and tried
      to imagine it wasn&rsquo;t there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, no, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had,&rdquo; sighed Anne, &ldquo;because then you&rsquo;d be able to sympathize
      with me. You can&rsquo;t sympathize properly if you&rsquo;ve never studied it. It is
      casting a cloud over my whole life. I&rsquo;m such a dunce at it, Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno,&rdquo; said Matthew soothingly. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re all right at
      anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair&rsquo;s store at Carmody that
      you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress.
      &lsquo;Rapid progress&rsquo; was his very words. There&rsquo;s them as runs down Teddy
      Phillips and says he ain&rsquo;t much of a teacher, but I guess he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was &ldquo;all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d get on better with geometry if only he wouldn&rsquo;t change the
      letters,&rdquo; complained Anne. &ldquo;I learn the proposition off by heart and then
      he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in
      the book and I get all mixed up. I don&rsquo;t think a teacher should take such
      a mean advantage, do you? We&rsquo;re studying agriculture now and I&rsquo;ve found
      out at last what makes the roads red. It&rsquo;s a great comfort. I wonder how
      Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde says Canada is
      going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa and that it&rsquo;s an
      awful warning to the electors. She says if women were allowed to vote we
      would soon see a blessed change. What way do you vote, Matthew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conservative,&rdquo; said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of
      Matthew&rsquo;s religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m Conservative too,&rdquo; said Anne decidedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad because Gil&mdash;because
      some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips is a Grit too
      because Prissy Andrews&rsquo;s father is one, and Ruby Gillis says that when a
      man is courting he always has to agree with the girl&rsquo;s mother in religion
      and her father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever go courting, Matthew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, no, I dunno&rsquo;s I ever did,&rdquo; said Matthew, who had certainly
      never thought of such a thing in his whole existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne reflected with her chin in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be rather interesting, don&rsquo;t you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis says
      when she grows up she&rsquo;s going to have ever so many beaus on the string and
      have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too exciting. I&rsquo;d
      rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis knows a great deal
      about such matters because she has so many big sisters, and Mrs. Lynde
      says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes. Mr. Phillips goes up
      to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening. He says it is to help her with
      her lessons but Miranda Sloane is studying for Queen&rsquo;s too, and I should
      think she needed help a lot more than Prissy because she&rsquo;s ever so much
      stupider, but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all. There are
      a great many things in this world that I can&rsquo;t understand very well,
      Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,&rdquo; acknowledged Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won&rsquo;t allow myself to open
      that new book Jane lent me until I&rsquo;m through. But it&rsquo;s a terrible
      temptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there
      just as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book
      that makes me cry. But I think I&rsquo;ll carry that book into the sitting room
      and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must <i>not</i>
      give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if I implore
      you on my bended knees. It&rsquo;s all very well to say resist temptation, but
      it&rsquo;s ever so much easier to resist it if you can&rsquo;t get the key. And then
      shall I run down the cellar and get some russets, Matthew? Wouldn&rsquo;t you
      like some russets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno but what I would,&rdquo; said Matthew, who never ate russets
      but knew Anne&rsquo;s weakness for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of
      russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside
      and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana
      Barry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around her
      head. Anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise, and
      plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder and were
      found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day, by Marilla,
      who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadn&rsquo;t been set on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is the matter, Diana?&rdquo; cried Anne. &ldquo;Has your mother relented at
      last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anne, do come quick,&rdquo; implored Diana nervously. &ldquo;Minnie May is awful
      sick&mdash;she&rsquo;s got croup. Young Mary Joe says&mdash;and Father and
      Mother are away to town and there&rsquo;s nobody to go for the doctor. Minnie
      May is awful bad and Young Mary Joe doesn&rsquo;t know what to do&mdash;and oh,
      Anne, I&rsquo;m so scared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew, without a word, reached out for cap and coat, slipped past Diana
      and away into the darkness of the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the doctor,&rdquo;
       said Anne, who was hurrying on hood and jacket. &ldquo;I know it as well as if
      he&rsquo;d said so. Matthew and I are such kindred spirits I can read his
      thoughts without words at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;ll find the doctor at Carmody,&rdquo; sobbed Diana. &ldquo;I know
      that Dr. Blair went to town and I guess Dr. Spencer would go too. Young
      Mary Joe never saw anybody with croup and Mrs. Lynde is away. Oh, Anne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Di,&rdquo; said Anne cheerily. &ldquo;I know exactly what to do for croup.
      You forget that Mrs. Hammond had twins three times. When you look after
      three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. They all had
      croup regularly. Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle&mdash;you mayn&rsquo;t
      have any at your house. Come on now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through Lover&rsquo;s
      Lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too deep to go
      by the shorter wood way. Anne, although sincerely sorry for Minnie May,
      was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the
      sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy
      slope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the
      dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind
      whistling through them. Anne thought it was truly delightful to go
      skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend
      who had been so long estranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie May, aged three, was really very sick. She lay on the kitchen sofa
      feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard all over
      the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl from the
      creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children during her
      absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of thinking what to
      do, or doing it if she thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne went to work with skill and promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minnie May has croup all right; she&rsquo;s pretty bad, but I&rsquo;ve seen them
      worse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there isn&rsquo;t
      more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I&rsquo;ve filled it up, and, Mary Joe,
      you may put some wood in the stove. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings but
      it seems to me you might have thought of this before if you&rsquo;d any
      imagination. Now, I&rsquo;ll undress Minnie May and put her to bed and you try
      to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. I&rsquo;m going to give her a dose of
      ipecac first of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Minnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up
      three pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once,
      but many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls
      worked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe,
      honestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated
      more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three o&rsquo;clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been
      obliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need
      for assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping
      soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was awfully near giving up in despair,&rdquo; explained Anne. &ldquo;She got worse
      and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were, even the
      last pair. I actually thought she was going to choke to death. I gave her
      every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I
      said to myself&mdash;not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I didn&rsquo;t want
      to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had to say it to
      myself just to relieve my feelings&mdash;&lsquo;This is the last lingering hope
      and I fear, tis a vain one.&rsquo; But in about three minutes she coughed up the
      phlegm and began to get better right away. You must just imagine my
      relief, doctor, because I can&rsquo;t express it in words. You know there are
      some things that cannot be expressed in words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; nodded the doctor. He looked at Anne as if he were thinking
      some things about her that couldn&rsquo;t be expressed in words. Later on,
      however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert&rsquo;s is as smart as
      they make &lsquo;em. I tell you she saved that baby&rsquo;s life, for it would have
      been too late by the time I got there. She seems to have a skill and
      presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age. I never saw
      anything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne had gone home in the wonderful, white-frosted winter morning, heavy
      eyed from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to Matthew as they
      crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of
      the Lover&rsquo;s Lane maples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Matthew, isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful morning? The world looks like something
      God had just imagined for His own pleasure, doesn&rsquo;t it? Those trees look
      as if I could blow them away with a breath&mdash;pouf! I&rsquo;m so glad I live
      in a world where there are white frosts, aren&rsquo;t you? And I&rsquo;m so glad Mrs.
      Hammond had three pairs of twins after all. If she hadn&rsquo;t I mightn&rsquo;t have
      known what to do for Minnie May. I&rsquo;m real sorry I was ever cross with Mrs.
      Hammond for having twins. But, oh, Matthew, I&rsquo;m so sleepy. I can&rsquo;t go to
      school. I just know I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes open and I&rsquo;d be so stupid. But
      I hate to stay home, for Gil&mdash;some of the others will get head of the
      class, and it&rsquo;s so hard to get up again&mdash;although of course the
      harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I guess you&rsquo;ll manage all right,&rdquo; said Matthew, looking at
      Anne&rsquo;s white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes. &ldquo;You just go
      right to bed and have a good sleep. I&rsquo;ll do all the chores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was
      well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and
      descended to the kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the
      meantime, was sitting knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you see the Premier?&rdquo; exclaimed Anne at once. &ldquo;What did he look
      like Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he never got to be Premier on account of his looks,&rdquo; said Marilla.
      &ldquo;Such a nose as that man had! But he can speak. I was proud of being a
      Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no use for
      him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself some blue
      plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess you&rsquo;re hungry. Matthew has been
      telling me about last night. I must say it was fortunate you knew what to
      do. I wouldn&rsquo;t have had any idea myself, for I never saw a case of croup.
      There now, never mind talking till you&rsquo;ve had your dinner. I can tell by
      the look of you that you&rsquo;re just full up with speeches, but they&rsquo;ll keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then for
      she knew if she did Anne&rsquo;s consequent excitement would lift her clear out
      of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner. Not until
      Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She wanted to see you, but I
      wouldn&rsquo;t wake you up. She says you saved Minnie May&rsquo;s life, and she is
      very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. She
      says she knows now you didn&rsquo;t mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes
      you&rsquo;ll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again. You&rsquo;re to go over
      this evening if you like for Diana can&rsquo;t stir outside the door on account
      of a bad cold she caught last night. Now, Anne Shirley, for pity&rsquo;s sake
      don&rsquo;t fly up into the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne&rsquo;s
      expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated
      with the flame of her spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, can I go right now&mdash;without washing my dishes? I&rsquo;ll
      wash them when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so
      unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, run along,&rdquo; said Marilla indulgently. &ldquo;Anne Shirley&mdash;are
      you crazy? Come back this instant and put something on you. I might as
      well call to the wind. She&rsquo;s gone without a cap or wrap. Look at her
      tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming. It&rsquo;ll be a mercy if
      she doesn&rsquo;t catch her death of cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy
      places. Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like sparkle
      of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over
      gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce. The tinkles of sleigh
      bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through the frosty air,
      but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne&rsquo;s heart and on her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,&rdquo; she announced.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly happy&mdash;yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I
      have a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she
      was so sorry and she could never repay me. I felt fearfully embarrassed,
      Marilla, but I just said as politely as I could, &lsquo;I have no hard feelings
      for you, Mrs. Barry. I assure you once for all that I did not mean to
      intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the mantle of
      oblivion.&rsquo; That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn&rsquo;t it,
      Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry&rsquo;s head. And Diana
      and I had a lovely afternoon. Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch
      her aunt over at Carmody taught her. Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but
      us, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. Diana
      gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of
      poetry:&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;If you love me as I love you
      Nothing but death can part us two.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is true, Marilla. We&rsquo;re going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us sit
      together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews. We
      had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out, Marilla,
      just as if I was real company. I can&rsquo;t tell you what a thrill it gave me.
      Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before. And we had
      fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves,
      Marilla. And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said &lsquo;Pa, why don&rsquo;t you
      pass the biscuits to Anne?&rsquo; It must be lovely to be grown up, Marilla,
      when just being treated as if you were is so nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Marilla, with a brief sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, when I am grown up,&rdquo; said Anne decidedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always going
      to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I&rsquo;ll never laugh when
      they use big words. I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts one&rsquo;s
      feelings. After tea Diana and I made taffy. The taffy wasn&rsquo;t very good, I
      suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before. Diana left
      me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and let it burn;
      and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over
      one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of it was
      splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come over as
      often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all
      the way down to Lover&rsquo;s Lane. I assure you, Marilla, that I feel like
      praying tonight and I&rsquo;m going to think out a special brand-new prayer in
      honor of the occasion.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX. A Concert a Catastrophe and a Confession
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA, can I go
      over to see Diana just for a minute?&rdquo; asked Anne, running breathlessly
      down from the east gable one February evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for,&rdquo; said
      Marilla shortly. &ldquo;You and Diana walked home from school together and then
      stood down there in the snow for half an hour more, your tongues going the
      whole blessed time, clickety-clack. So I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re very badly off
      to see her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she wants to see me,&rdquo; pleaded Anne. &ldquo;She has something very important
      to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know she has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she just signaled to me from her window. We have arranged a way
      to signal with our candles and cardboard. We set the candle on the window
      sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth. So many
      flashes mean a certain thing. It was my idea, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you it was,&rdquo; said Marilla emphatically. &ldquo;And the next thing
      you&rsquo;ll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re very careful, Marilla. And it&rsquo;s so interesting. Two flashes
      mean, &lsquo;Are you there?&rsquo; Three mean &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and four &lsquo;no.&rsquo; Five mean, &lsquo;Come
      over as soon as possible, because I have something important to reveal.&rsquo; 
      Diana has just signaled five flashes, and I&rsquo;m really suffering to know
      what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t suffer any longer,&rdquo; said Marilla sarcastically. &ldquo;You
      can go, but you&rsquo;re to be back here in just ten minutes, remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time, although
      probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the
      discussion of Diana&rsquo;s important communication within the limits of ten
      minutes. But at least she had made good use of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, what do you think? You know tomorrow is Diana&rsquo;s birthday.
      Well, her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school
      and stay all night with her. And her cousins are coming over from
      Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at the
      hall tomorrow night. And they are going to take Diana and me to the
      concert&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll let me go, that is. You will, won&rsquo;t you, Marilla?
      Oh, I feel so excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can calm down then, because you&rsquo;re not going. You&rsquo;re better at home
      in your own bed, and as for that club concert, it&rsquo;s all nonsense, and
      little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair,&rdquo; pleaded Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying it isn&rsquo;t. But you&rsquo;re not going to begin gadding about to
      concerts and staying out all hours of the night. Pretty doings for
      children. I&rsquo;m surprised at Mrs. Barry&rsquo;s letting Diana go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a very special occasion,&rdquo; mourned Anne, on the verge of
      tears. &ldquo;Diana has only one birthday in a year. It isn&rsquo;t as if birthdays
      were common things, Marilla. Prissy Andrews is going to recite &lsquo;Curfew
      Must Not Ring Tonight.&rsquo; That is such a good moral piece, Marilla, I&rsquo;m sure
      it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir are going to sing
      four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns. And oh,
      Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is; he&rsquo;s
      going to give an address. That will be just about the same thing as a
      sermon. Please, mayn&rsquo;t I go, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard what I said, Anne, didn&rsquo;t you? Take off your boots now and go
      to bed. It&rsquo;s past eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one more thing, Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne, with the air of
      producing the last shot in her locker. &ldquo;Mrs. Barry told Diana that we
      might sleep in the spare-room bed. Think of the honor of your little Anne
      being put in the spare-room bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor you&rsquo;ll have to get along without. Go to bed, Anne, and
      don&rsquo;t let me hear another word out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Anne, with tears rolling over her cheeks, had gone sorrowfully
      upstairs, Matthew, who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge
      during the whole dialogue, opened his eyes and said decidedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, Marilla, I think you ought to let Anne go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t then,&rdquo; retorted Marilla. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s bringing this child up, Matthew,
      you or me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, you,&rdquo; admitted Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interfere then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I ain&rsquo;t interfering. It ain&rsquo;t interfering to have your own
      opinion. And my opinion is that you ought to let Anne go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think I ought to let Anne go to the moon if she took the notion,
      I&rsquo;ve no doubt&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s amiable rejoinder. &ldquo;I might have let her
      spend the night with Diana, if that was all. But I don&rsquo;t approve of this
      concert plan. She&rsquo;d go there and catch cold like as not, and have her head
      filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would unsettle her for a week.
      I understand that child&rsquo;s disposition and what&rsquo;s good for it better than
      you, Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you ought to let Anne go,&rdquo; repeated Matthew firmly. Argument was
      not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly was.
      Marilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence. The next
      morning, when Anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry, Matthew
      paused on his way out to the barn to say to Marilla again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you ought to let Anne go, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered. Then she
      yielded to the inevitable and said tartly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, she can go, since nothing else &lsquo;ll please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne flew out of the pantry, dripping dishcloth in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, Marilla, say those blessed words again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess once is enough to say them. This is Matthew&rsquo;s doings and I wash
      my hands of it. If you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming
      out of that hot hall in the middle of the night, don&rsquo;t blame me, blame
      Matthew. Anne Shirley, you&rsquo;re dripping greasy water all over the floor. I
      never saw such a careless child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know I&rsquo;m a great trial to you, Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne repentantly. &ldquo;I
      make so many mistakes. But then just think of all the mistakes I don&rsquo;t
      make, although I might. I&rsquo;ll get some sand and scrub up the spots before I
      go to school. Oh, Marilla, my heart was just set on going to that concert.
      I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other girls talk about
      them in school I feel so out of it. You didn&rsquo;t know just how I felt about
      it, but you see Matthew did. Matthew understands me, and it&rsquo;s so nice to
      be understood, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in
      school. Gilbert Blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out of
      sight in mental arithmetic. Anne&rsquo;s consequent humiliation was less than it
      might have been, however, in view of the concert and the spare-room bed.
      She and Diana talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter
      teacher than Mr. Phillips dire disgrace must inevitably have been their
      portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going to
      the concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school. The
      Avonlea Debating Club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several
      smaller free entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission
      ten cents, in aid of the library. The Avonlea young people had been
      practicing for weeks, and all the scholars were especially interested in
      it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part.
      Everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go, except Carrie
      Sloane, whose father shared Marilla&rsquo;s opinions about small girls going out
      to night concerts. Carrie Sloane cried into her grammar all the afternoon
      and felt that life was not worth living.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and
      increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive
      ecstasy in the concert itself. They had a &ldquo;perfectly elegant tea;&rdquo; and
      then came the delicious occupation of dressing in Diana&rsquo;s little room
      upstairs. Diana did Anne&rsquo;s front hair in the new pompadour style and Anne
      tied Diana&rsquo;s bows with the especial knack she possessed; and they
      experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their
      back hair. At last they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, Anne could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain
      black tam and shapeless, tight-sleeved, homemade gray-cloth coat with
      Diana&rsquo;s jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket. But she remembered in time
      that she had an imagination and could use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Diana&rsquo;s cousins, the Murrays from Newbridge, came; they all crowded
      into the big pung sleigh, among straw and furry robes. Anne reveled in the
      drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with the
      snow crisping under the runners. There was a magnificent sunset, and the
      snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in
      the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and
      fire. Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed like the
      mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana,&rdquo; breathed Anne, squeezing Diana&rsquo;s mittened hand under the fur
      robe, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it all like a beautiful dream? Do I really look the same as
      usual? I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look awfully nice,&rdquo; said Diana, who having just received a compliment
      from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
      the loveliest color.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The program that night was a series of &ldquo;thrills&rdquo; for at least one listener
      in the audience, and, as Anne assured Diana, every succeeding thrill was
      thrillier than the last. When Prissy Andrews, attired in a new pink-silk
      waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white throat and real
      carnations in her hair&mdash;rumor whispered that the master had sent all
      the way to town for them for her&mdash;&ldquo;climbed the slimy ladder, dark
      without one ray of light,&rdquo; Anne shivered in luxurious sympathy; when the
      choir sang &ldquo;Far Above the Gentle Daisies&rdquo; Anne gazed at the ceiling as if
      it were frescoed with angels; when Sam Sloane proceeded to explain and
      illustrate &ldquo;How Sockery Set a Hen&rdquo; Anne laughed until people sitting near
      her laughed too, more out of sympathy with her than with amusement at a
      selection that was rather threadbare even in Avonlea; and when Mr.
      Phillips gave Mark Antony&rsquo;s oration over the dead body of Caesar in the
      most heart-stirring tones&mdash;looking at Prissy Andrews at the end of
      every sentence&mdash;Anne felt that she could rise and mutiny on the spot
      if but one Roman citizen led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one number on the program failed to interest her. When Gilbert Blythe
      recited &ldquo;Bingen on the Rhine&rdquo; Anne picked up Rhoda Murray&rsquo;s library book
      and read it until he had finished, when she sat rigidly stiff and
      motionless while Diana clapped her hands until they tingled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eleven when they got home, sated with dissipation, but with the
      exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come. Everybody
      seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent. Anne and Diana tiptoed
      into the parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened. It
      was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the
      grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s undress here,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice and warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it been a delightful time?&rdquo; sighed Anne rapturously. &ldquo;It must be
      splendid to get up and recite there. Do you suppose we will ever be asked
      to do it, Diana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, someday. They&rsquo;re always wanting the big scholars to
      recite. Gilbert Blythe does often and he&rsquo;s only two years older than us.
      Oh, Anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him? When he came to the
      line,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
           &lsquo;<i>There&rsquo;s Another</i>, not <i>a sister</i>,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      he looked right down at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana,&rdquo; said Anne with dignity, &ldquo;you are my bosom friend, but I cannot
      allow even you to speak to me of that person. Are you ready for bed? Let&rsquo;s
      run a race and see who&rsquo;ll get to the bed first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion appealed to Diana. The two little white-clad figures flew
      down the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed at
      the same moment. And then&mdash;something&mdash;moved beneath them, there
      was a gasp and a cry&mdash;and somebody said in muffled accents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne and Diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed and
      out of the room. They only knew that after one frantic rush they found
      themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, who was it&mdash;<i>what</i> was it?&rdquo; whispered Anne, her teeth
      chattering with cold and fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Aunt Josephine,&rdquo; said Diana, gasping with laughter. &ldquo;Oh, Anne, it
      was Aunt Josephine, however she came to be there. Oh, and I know she will
      be furious. It&rsquo;s dreadful&mdash;it&rsquo;s really dreadful&mdash;but did you
      ever know anything so funny, Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your Aunt Josephine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s aunt and she lives in Charlottetown. She&rsquo;s awfully old&mdash;seventy
      anyhow&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t believe she was <i>ever</i> a little girl. We
      were expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon. She&rsquo;s awfully prim
      and proper and she&rsquo;ll scold dreadfully about this, I know. Well, we&rsquo;ll
      have to sleep with Minnie May&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t think how she kicks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Josephine Barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next
      morning. Mrs. Barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a good time last night? I tried to stay awake until you came
      home, for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you would
      have to go upstairs after all, but I was so tired I fell asleep. I hope
      you didn&rsquo;t disturb your aunt, Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana preserved a discreet silence, but she and Anne exchanged furtive
      smiles of guilty amusement across the table. Anne hurried home after
      breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which
      presently resulted in the Barry household until the late afternoon, when
      she went down to Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s on an errand for Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last
      night?&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Barry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody. She&rsquo;s feeling real
      worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she got up
      this morning&mdash;and Josephine Barry&rsquo;s temper is no joke, I can tell you
      that. She wouldn&rsquo;t speak to Diana at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Diana&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; said Anne contritely. &ldquo;It was mine. I suggested
      racing to see who would get into bed first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser. &ldquo;I
      knew that idea came out of your head. Well, it&rsquo;s made a nice lot of
      trouble, that&rsquo;s what. Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month, but she
      declares she won&rsquo;t stay another day and is going right back to town
      tomorrow, Sunday and all as it is. She&rsquo;d have gone today if they could
      have taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter&rsquo;s music lessons for
      Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy.
      Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The Barrys
      must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they&rsquo;d like to keep on the
      good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn&rsquo;t say just that to me, but
      I&rsquo;m a pretty good judge of human nature, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m such an unlucky girl,&rdquo; mourned Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always getting into scrapes
      myself and getting my best friends&mdash;people I&rsquo;d shed my heart&rsquo;s blood
      for&mdash;into them too. Can you tell me why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re too heedless and impulsive, child, that&rsquo;s what. You
      never stop to think&mdash;whatever comes into your head to say or do you
      say or do it without a moment&rsquo;s reflection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s the best of it,&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;Something just flashes
      into your mind, so exciting, and you must out with it. If you stop to
      think it over you spoil it all. Haven&rsquo;t you never felt that yourself, Mrs.
      Lynde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, Mrs. Lynde had not. She shook her head sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must learn to think a little, Anne, that&rsquo;s what. The proverb you need
      to go by is &lsquo;Look before you leap&rsquo;&mdash;especially into spare-room beds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke, but Anne remained
      pensive. She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her eyes
      appeared very serious. When she left Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s she took her way across
      the crusted fields to Orchard Slope. Diana met her at the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; whispered Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance over
      her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. &ldquo;She was fairly dancing with
      rage, Anne. Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the worst-behaved girl she
      ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had
      brought me up. She says she won&rsquo;t stay and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care. But
      Father and Mother do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell them it was my fault?&rdquo; demanded Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;d do such a thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Diana with just scorn.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame as
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going in to tell her myself,&rdquo; said Anne resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diana stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, you&rsquo;d never! why&mdash;she&rsquo;ll eat you alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t frighten me any more than I am frightened,&rdquo; implored Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      rather walk up to a cannon&rsquo;s mouth. But I&rsquo;ve got to do it, Diana. It was
      my fault and I&rsquo;ve got to confess. I&rsquo;ve had practice in confessing,
      fortunately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s in the room,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;You can go in if you want to. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t dare. And I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll do a bit of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den&mdash;that is to
      say, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly. A
      sharp &ldquo;Come in&rdquo; followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by the
      fire, her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her
      gold-rimmed glasses. She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see
      Diana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with
      a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Anne of Green Gables,&rdquo; said the small visitor tremulously, clasping
      her hands with her characteristic gesture, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve come to confess, if
      you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I
      suggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.
      Diana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it
      is to blame her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at
      least. Such carryings on in a respectable house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we were only in fun,&rdquo; persisted Anne. &ldquo;I think you ought to forgive
      us, Miss Barry, now that we&rsquo;ve apologized. And anyhow, please forgive
      Diana and let her have her music lessons. Diana&rsquo;s heart is set on her
      music lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your
      heart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be
      cross with me. I&rsquo;ve been so used in my early days to having people cross
      at me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Much of the snap had gone out of the old lady&rsquo;s eyes by this time and was
      replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said severely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun. Little
      girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You don&rsquo;t know
      what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long and arduous
      journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i>, but I can <i>imagine</i>,&rdquo; said Anne eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sure it must have been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it
      too. Have you any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself
      in our place. We didn&rsquo;t know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly
      scared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we
      couldn&rsquo;t sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are
      used to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel like
      if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed&mdash;a
      sound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen
      outside, to give a great gasp of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my imagination is a little rusty&mdash;it&rsquo;s so long since I
      used it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong
      as mine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell
      me about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne firmly. &ldquo;I would like to, because you
      seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred spirit
      although you don&rsquo;t look very much like it. But it is my duty to go home to
      Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind lady who has
      taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but it is very
      discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on the bed. But
      before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive Diana and stay
      just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me
      occasionally,&rdquo; said Miss Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the
      senior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better
      acquainted with that Anne-girl,&rdquo; she said frankly. &ldquo;She amuses me, and at
      my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla&rsquo;s only comment when she heard the story was, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; This
      was for Matthew&rsquo;s benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Barry stayed her month out and over. She was a more agreeable guest
      than usual, for Anne kept her in good humor. They became firm friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Barry went away she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you&rsquo;re to visit me and
      I&rsquo;ll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Barry was a kindred spirit, after all,&rdquo; Anne confided to Marilla.
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think so to look at her, but she is. You don&rsquo;t find it right
      out at first, as in Matthew&rsquo;s case, but after a while you come to see it.
      Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It&rsquo;s splendid to
      find out there are so many of them in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XX. A Good Imagination Gone Wrong
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>PRING had come
      once more to Green Gables&mdash;the beautiful capricious, reluctant
      Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a succession of
      sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection
      and growth. The maples in Lover&rsquo;s Lane were red budded and little curly
      ferns pushed up around the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble. Away up in the barrens, behind
      Mr. Silas Sloane&rsquo;s place, the Mayflowers blossomed out, pink and white
      stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the school girls and boys
      had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming home in the clear, echoing
      twilight with arms and baskets full of flowery spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no Mayflowers,&rdquo;
       said Anne. &ldquo;Diana says perhaps they have something better, but there
      couldn&rsquo;t be anything better than Mayflowers, could there, Marilla? And
      Diana says if they don&rsquo;t know what they are like they don&rsquo;t miss them. But
      I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it would be <i>tragic</i>,
      Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and <i>not</i> to miss them.
      Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think they must be the
      souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven. But
      we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our lunch down in a big
      mossy hollow by an old well&mdash;such a <i>romantic</i> spot. Charlie
      Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because he wouldn&rsquo;t
      take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very <i>fashionable</i> to
      dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews and
      I heard him to say &lsquo;sweets to the sweet.&rsquo; He got that out of a book, I
      know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some Mayflowers
      too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can&rsquo;t tell you the person&rsquo;s name
      because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We made wreaths of the
      Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the time came to go home we
      marched in procession down the road, two by two, with our bouquets and
      wreaths, singing &lsquo;My Home on the Hill.&rsquo; Oh, it was so thrilling, Marilla.
      All Mr. Silas Sloane&rsquo;s folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on
      the road stopped and stared after us. We made a real sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much wonder! Such silly doings!&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s response.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled with
      them. Anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent steps and
      worshiping eyes, as if she trod on holy ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; she told Diana, &ldquo;when I&rsquo;m going through here I don&rsquo;t really
      care whether Gil&mdash;whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not.
      But when I&rsquo;m up in school it&rsquo;s all different and I care as much as ever.
      There&rsquo;s such a lot of different Annes in me. I sometimes think that is why
      I&rsquo;m such a troublesome person. If I was just the one Anne it would be ever
      so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn&rsquo;t be half so interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the
      frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the
      Lake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover fields
      and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window. She had been
      studying her lessons, but it had grown too dark to see the book, so she
      had fallen into wide-eyed reverie, looking out past the boughs of the Snow
      Queen, once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged. The
      walls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly and
      yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was altered.
      It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it
      and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses and ribbons,
      and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table. It
      was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its vivid occupant had
      taken a visible although unmaterial form and had tapestried the bare room
      with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and moonshine. Presently Marilla
      came briskly in with some of Anne&rsquo;s freshly ironed school aprons. She hung
      them over a chair and sat down with a short sigh. She had had one of her
      headaches that afternoon, and although the pain had gone she felt weak and
      &ldquo;tuckered out,&rdquo; as she expressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid
      with sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla. I
      would have endured it joyfully for your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest,&rdquo;
       said Marilla. &ldquo;You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes
      than usual. Of course it wasn&rsquo;t exactly necessary to starch Matthew&rsquo;s
      handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up
      for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it
      to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be your way evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Headaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Anne penitently. &ldquo;I never thought about that pie
      from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt <i>instinctively</i>
      that there was something missing on the dinner table. I was firmly
      resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to imagine
      anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until I put the
      pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an
      enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding
      to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that is how I came to forget the
      pie. I didn&rsquo;t know I starched the handkerchiefs. All the time I was
      ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have
      discovered up the brook. It&rsquo;s the most ravishing spot, Marilla. There are
      two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it. At last it
      struck me that it would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we
      found it on the Queen&rsquo;s birthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I&rsquo;m
      sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good
      today because it&rsquo;s an anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day
      last year, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t think of anything special.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never forget
      it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t seem so
      important to you. I&rsquo;ve been here for a year and I&rsquo;ve been so happy. Of
      course, I&rsquo;ve had my troubles, but one can live down troubles. Are you
      sorry you kept me, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how she
      could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, &ldquo;no, not exactly sorry.
      If you&rsquo;ve finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and ask Mrs.
      Barry if she&rsquo;ll lend me Diana&rsquo;s apron pattern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s too dark,&rdquo; cried Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too dark? Why, it&rsquo;s only twilight. And goodness knows you&rsquo;ve gone over
      often enough after dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over early in the morning,&rdquo; said Anne eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get up at
      sunrise and go over, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? I want that pattern to cut
      out your new apron this evening. Go at once and be smart too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go around by the road, then,&rdquo; said Anne, taking up her hat
      reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go by the road and waste half an hour! I&rsquo;d like to catch you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,&rdquo; cried Anne desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted
      Wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spruce wood over the brook,&rdquo; said Anne in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who has
      been telling you such stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; confessed Anne. &ldquo;Diana and I just imagined the wood was haunted.
      All the places around here are so&mdash;so&mdash;<i>commonplace</i>. We
      just got this up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted
      wood is so very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it&rsquo;s
      so gloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There&rsquo;s a white
      lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings
      her hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a
      death in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the
      corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers
      on your hand&mdash;so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it.
      And there&rsquo;s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons
      glower at you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn&rsquo;t go through the
      Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. I&rsquo;d be sure that white things
      would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ever anyone hear the like!&rdquo; ejaculated Marilla, who had listened in
      dumb amazement. &ldquo;Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you believe all that
      wicked nonsense of your own imagination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not believe <i>exactly</i>,&rdquo; faltered Anne. &ldquo;At least, I don&rsquo;t believe it
      in daylight. But after dark, Marilla, it&rsquo;s different. That is when ghosts
      walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but there are, Marilla,&rdquo; cried Anne eagerly. &ldquo;I know people who have
      seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says that his
      grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after he&rsquo;d
      been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane&rsquo;s grandmother wouldn&rsquo;t
      tell a story for anything. She&rsquo;s a very religious woman. And Mrs. Thomas&rsquo;s
      father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off
      hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the spirit of his
      brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days. He
      didn&rsquo;t, but he died two years after, so you see it was really true. And
      Ruby Gillis says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley,&rdquo; interrupted Marilla firmly, &ldquo;I never want to hear you
      talking in this fashion again. I&rsquo;ve had my doubts about that imagination
      of yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I
      won&rsquo;t countenance any such doings. You&rsquo;ll go right over to Barry&rsquo;s, and
      you&rsquo;ll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to
      you. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne might plead and cry as she liked&mdash;and did, for her terror was
      very real. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce
      grove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She
      marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her to
      proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of
      wailing ladies and headless specters beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?&rdquo; sobbed Anne. &ldquo;What would you feel
      like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; said Marilla unfeelingly. &ldquo;You know I always mean what I
      say. I&rsquo;ll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne marched. That is, she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up
      the horrible dim path beyond. Anne never forgot that walk. Bitterly did
      she repent the license she had given to her imagination. The goblins of
      her fancy lurked in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold,
      fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them into
      being. A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the
      brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still. The long-drawn wail
      of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the perspiration
      in beads on her forehead. The swoop of bats in the darkness over her was
      as the wings of unearthly creatures. When she reached Mr. William Bell&rsquo;s
      field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of white things, and
      arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath that she could hardly
      gasp out her request for the apron pattern. Diana was away so that she had
      no excuse to linger. The dreadful return journey had to be faced. Anne
      went back over it with shut eyes, preferring to take the risk of dashing
      her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing. When she
      finally stumbled over the log bridge she drew one long shivering breath of
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so nothing caught you?&rdquo; said Marilla unsympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mar&mdash;Marilla,&rdquo; chattered Anne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll b-b-be contt-tented with
      c-c-commonplace places after this.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI. A New Departure in Flavorings

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>EAR ME, there is
      nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as Mrs. Lynde says,&rdquo;
       remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books down on the kitchen
      table on the last day of June and wiping her red eyes with a very damp
      handkerchief. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it fortunate, Marilla, that I took an extra
      handkerchief to school today? I had a presentiment that it would be
      needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you&rsquo;d require two
      handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away,&rdquo; said
      Marilla.

      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,&rdquo;
       reflected Anne. &ldquo;I just cried because all the others did. It was Ruby
      Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr. Phillips,
      but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into
      tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other. I tried to
      hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit
      with Gil&mdash;with a boy; and the time he spelled my name without an &lsquo;e&rsquo; 
      on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at
      geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he had been so
      horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn&rsquo;t, Marilla, and I just had to
      cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she&rsquo;d be
      when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she&rsquo;d never shed a tear.
      Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from
      her brother&mdash;of course the boys didn&rsquo;t cry&mdash;because she hadn&rsquo;t
      brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh, Marilla, it was
      heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech
      beginning, &lsquo;The time has come for us to part.&rsquo; It was very affecting. And
      he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt dreadfully sorry and
      remorseful for all the times I&rsquo;d talked in school and drawn pictures of
      him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy. I can tell you I wished
      I&rsquo;d been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She hadn&rsquo;t anything on her
      conscience. The girls cried all the way home from school. Carrie Sloane
      kept saying every few minutes, &lsquo;The time has come for us to part,&rsquo; and
      that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering
      up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one can&rsquo;t feel quite in the
      depths of despair with two months&rsquo; vacation before them, can they,
      Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his wife coming from the
      station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I
      couldn&rsquo;t help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? His
      wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of course&mdash;it
      wouldn&rsquo;t do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife,
      because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the minister&rsquo;s wife
      over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so
      fashionably. Our new minister&rsquo;s wife was dressed in blue muslin with
      lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses. Jane Andrews said she
      thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister&rsquo;s wife, but I
      didn&rsquo;t make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, because I know what it
      is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides, she&rsquo;s only been a minister&rsquo;s wife
      for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn&rsquo;t they? They
      are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s that evening, was actuated by
      any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had
      borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most
      of the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes never
      expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the borrowers
      thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife, was a lawful
      object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement where sensations
      were few and far between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in imagination,
      had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a widower when he
      came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that gossip regularly
      married him to this, that, or the other one, every year of his sojourn. In
      the preceding February he had resigned his charge and departed amid the
      regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection born of long
      intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his shortcomings as an
      orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious
      dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and &ldquo;supplies&rdquo;
       who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on trial. These stood or fell by
      the judgment of the fathers and mothers in Israel; but a certain small,
      red-haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old Cuthbert pew also
      had her opinions about them and discussed the same in full with Matthew,
      Marilla always declining from principle to criticize ministers in any
      shape or form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew&rdquo; was Anne&rsquo;s final
      summing up. &ldquo;Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his
      worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley&rsquo;s&mdash;he had no imagination. And
      Mr. Terry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in
      the matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology
      wasn&rsquo;t sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,
      but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church; he
      was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister, mustn&rsquo;t
      you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive; but Mrs.
      Lynde says he isn&rsquo;t married, or even engaged, because she made special
      inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have a young
      unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the congregation
      and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isn&rsquo;t
      she, Matthew? I&rsquo;m very glad they&rsquo;ve called Mr. Allan. I liked him because
      his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as
      if he did it because he was in the habit of it. Mrs. Lynde says he isn&rsquo;t
      perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn&rsquo;t expect a perfect minister
      for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, and anyhow his theology is
      sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine.
      And she knows his wife&rsquo;s people and they are most respectable and the
      women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde says that sound doctrine in
      the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a
      minister&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still
      on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for
      their chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.
      Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals,
      and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the
      manse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love. She
      had discovered another kindred spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,&rdquo; she announced one Sunday afternoon.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s taken our class and she&rsquo;s a splendid teacher. She said right away
      she didn&rsquo;t think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions, and
      you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I&rsquo;ve always thought. She said we
      could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many. I&rsquo;m good at
      asking questions, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s emphatic comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was to
      be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn&rsquo;t think that was a very
      proper question to ask because it hadn&rsquo;t any connection with the lesson&mdash;the
      lesson was about Daniel in the lions&rsquo; den&mdash;but Mrs. Allan just smiled
      and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a lovely smile; she
      has such <i>exquisite</i> dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had dimples in
      my cheeks, Marilla. I&rsquo;m not half so skinny as I was when I came here, but
      I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence people for good.
      Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good.
      She talked so nice about everything. I never knew before that religion was
      such a cheerful thing. I always thought it was kind of melancholy, but
      Mrs. Allan&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;d like to be a Christian if I could be one like
      her. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be one like Mr. Superintendent Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,&rdquo; said Marilla
      severely. &ldquo;Mr. Bell is a real good man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course he&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; agreed Anne, &ldquo;but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to get any
      comfort out of it. If I could be good I&rsquo;d dance and sing all day because I
      was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and of
      course it wouldn&rsquo;t be dignified in a minister&rsquo;s wife. But I can just feel
      she&rsquo;s glad she&rsquo;s a Christian and that she&rsquo;d be one even if she could get
      to heaven without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,&rdquo; said
      Marilla reflectively. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been most everywhere but here. Let me see.
      Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don&rsquo;t say a word to
      Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he&rsquo;d find some excuse to
      be away that day. He&rsquo;d got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn&rsquo;t mind him, but
      he&rsquo;s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister, and a
      new minister&rsquo;s wife will frighten him to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as secret as the dead,&rdquo; assured Anne. &ldquo;But oh, Marilla, will you
      let me make a cake for the occasion? I&rsquo;d love to do something for Mrs.
      Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can make a layer cake,&rdquo; promised Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables. Having the
      minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking, and
      Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the Avonlea
      housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She talked it all
      over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they sat on the big red
      stones by the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little
      twigs dipped in fir balsam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I&rsquo;m to make in the
      morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just
      before teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy
      two days of it. It&rsquo;s such a responsibility having a minister&rsquo;s family to
      tea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see
      our pantry. It&rsquo;s a sight to behold. We&rsquo;re going to have jellied chicken
      and cold tongue. We&rsquo;re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and
      whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,
      and fruit cake, and Marilla&rsquo;s famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps
      especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and biscuits as
      aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister is dyspeptic
      and can&rsquo;t eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic, but I don&rsquo;t
      think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad
      effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake. Oh, Diana,
      what if it shouldn&rsquo;t be good! I dreamed last night that I was chased all
      around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be good, all right,&rdquo; assured Diana, who was a very comfortable sort
      of friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch
      in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when
      you especially want them to be good,&rdquo; sighed Anne, setting a particularly
      well-balsamed twig afloat. &ldquo;However, I suppose I shall just have to trust
      to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh, look, Diana, what a
      lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away
      and take it for a scarf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there is no such thing as a dryad,&rdquo; said Diana. Diana&rsquo;s mother
      had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over it.
      As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights of
      imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief
      even in harmless dryads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so easy to imagine there is,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Every night before I
      go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really
      sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes I
      look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don&rsquo;t give
      up your faith in the dryad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too excited
      to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her
      dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short of
      absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matters
      that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake. When she
      finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you
      think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn&rsquo;t good? I
      used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of
      getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.
      Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says
      we&rsquo;ll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what
      if that cake doesn&rsquo;t rise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have plenty without it&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s unimpassioned way of looking
      at the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and feathery
      as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together with
      layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it and
      possibly asking for another piece!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Can I
      fix the table with ferns and wild roses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; sniffed Marilla. &ldquo;In my opinion it&rsquo;s the
      eatables that matter and not flummery decorations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Barry had <i>her</i> table decorated,&rdquo; said Anne, who was not
      entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, &ldquo;and the minister paid
      her an elegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as
      the palate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do as you like,&rdquo; said Marilla, who was quite determined not to be
      surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. &ldquo;Only mind you leave enough room
      for the dishes and the food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that
      should leave Mrs. Barry&rsquo;s nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns and
      a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a thing of
      beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they exclaimed
      in chorus over it loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Anne&rsquo;s doings,&rdquo; said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.
      Allan&rsquo;s approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness and
      Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that
      Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him in hand so
      successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes and white
      collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly. He never said a
      word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went merry as a marriage bell until Anne&rsquo;s layer cake was passed. Mrs.
      Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety, declined it.
      But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne&rsquo;s face, said smilingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I must sample it,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to a
      plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression crossed
      her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away at it.
      Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what on earth did you put into that cake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,&rdquo; cried Anne with a look of
      anguish. &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! It&rsquo;s simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don&rsquo;t try to eat it. Anne,
      taste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanilla,&rdquo; said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting
      the cake. &ldquo;Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking powder.
      I had my suspicions of that bak&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you
      used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled
      with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, &ldquo;Best Vanilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us, Anne, you&rsquo;ve flavored that cake with <i>Anodyne Liniment</i>.
      I broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old
      empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it&rsquo;s partly my fault&mdash;I should have
      warned you&mdash;but for pity&rsquo;s sake why couldn&rsquo;t you have smelled it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I had such a cold!&rdquo; and with this she fairly fled to the
      gable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who
      refuses to be comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; sobbed Anne, without looking up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disgraced forever. I
      shall never be able to live this down. It will get out&mdash;things always
      do get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I
      shall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the girl
      who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil&mdash;the boys in school
      will never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark of
      Christian pity don&rsquo;t tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes after
      this. I&rsquo;ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but I cannot
      ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll think I tried to
      poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried to poison
      her benefactor. But the liniment isn&rsquo;t poisonous. It&rsquo;s meant to be taken
      internally&mdash;although not in cakes. Won&rsquo;t you tell Mrs. Allan so,
      Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,&rdquo; said a merry voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with
      laughing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little girl, you mustn&rsquo;t cry like this,&rdquo; she said, genuinely
      disturbed by Anne&rsquo;s tragic face. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s all just a funny mistake that
      anybody might make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,&rdquo; said Anne forlornly. &ldquo;And I
      wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and
      thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now, you
      mustn&rsquo;t cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower
      garden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I want
      to see it, for I&rsquo;m very much interested in flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it
      was really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing more
      was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away Anne found
      that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been expected,
      considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla, isn&rsquo;t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no
      mistakes in it yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you&rsquo;ll make plenty in it,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;I never saw your
      beat for making mistakes, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and well I know it,&rdquo; admitted Anne mournfully. &ldquo;But have you ever
      noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same
      mistake twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as that&rsquo;s much benefit when you&rsquo;re always making new ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one
      person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I&rsquo;ll be through
      with them. That&rsquo;s a very comforting thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better go and give that cake to the pigs,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;It
      isn&rsquo;t fit for any human to eat, not even Jerry Boute.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII. Anne is Invited Out to Tea
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ND what are your
      eyes popping out of your head about. Now?&rdquo; asked Marilla, when Anne had
      just come in from a run to the post office. &ldquo;Have you discovered another
      kindred spirit?&rdquo; Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her
      eyes, kindled in every feature. She had come dancing up the lane, like a
      wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the
      August evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the manse
      tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post office.
      Just look at it, Marilla. &lsquo;Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.&rsquo; That is the
      first time I was ever called &lsquo;Miss.&rsquo; Such a thrill as it gave me! I shall
      cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Allan told me she meant to have all the members of her Sunday-school
      class to tea in turn,&rdquo; said Marilla, regarding the wonderful event very
      coolly. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t get in such a fever over it. Do learn to take things
      calmly, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature. All
      &ldquo;spirit and fire and dew,&rdquo; as she was, the pleasures and pains of life
      came to her with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely
      troubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would
      probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently
      understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than
      compensate. Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill Anne
      into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her
      as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows. She did not make
      much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted to herself. The downfall of some
      dear hope or plan plunged Anne into &ldquo;deeps of affliction.&rdquo; The fulfillment
      thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight. Marilla had almost begun
      to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her model little
      girl of demure manners and prim deportment. Neither would she have
      believed that she really liked Anne much better as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne went to bed that night speechless with misery because Matthew had
      said the wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day
      tomorrow. The rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her, it
      sounded so like pattering raindrops, and the full, faraway roar of the
      gulf, to which she listened delightedly at other times, loving its
      strange, sonorous, haunting rhythm, now seemed like a prophecy of storm
      and disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day. Anne
      thought that the morning would never come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all things have an end, even nights before the day on which you are
      invited to take tea at the manse. The morning, in spite of Matthew&rsquo;s
      predictions, was fine and Anne&rsquo;s spirits soared to their highest. &ldquo;Oh,
      Marilla, there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody
      I see,&rdquo; she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
      how good I feel! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if it could last? I believe I could
      be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day. But oh,
      Marilla, it&rsquo;s a solemn occasion too. I feel so anxious. What if I
      shouldn&rsquo;t behave properly? You know I never had tea at a manse before, and
      I&rsquo;m not sure that I know all the rules of etiquette, although I&rsquo;ve been
      studying the rules given in the Etiquette Department of the Family Herald
      ever since I came here. I&rsquo;m so afraid I&rsquo;ll do something silly or forget to
      do something I should do. Would it be good manners to take a second
      helping of anything if you wanted to <i>very</i> much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with you, Anne, is that you&rsquo;re thinking too much about
      yourself. You should just think of Mrs. Allan and what would be nicest and
      most agreeable to her,&rdquo; said Marilla, hitting for once in her life on a
      very sound and pithy piece of advice. Anne instantly realized this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Marilla. I&rsquo;ll try not to think about myself at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of
      &ldquo;etiquette,&rdquo; for she came home through the twilight, under a great,
      high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in a
      beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting on
      the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head
      in Marilla&rsquo;s gingham lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of
      firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star hung
      over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover&rsquo;s Lane, in
      and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them as she
      talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled
      up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, I&rsquo;ve had a most <i>fascinating</i> time. I feel that I have
      not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never
      be invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at
      the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with
      dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph. I
      really think I&rsquo;d like to be a minister&rsquo;s wife when I grow up, Marilla. A
      minister mightn&rsquo;t mind my red hair because he wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking of such
      worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good and
      I&rsquo;ll never be that, so I suppose there&rsquo;s no use in thinking about it. Some
      people are naturally good, you know, and others are not. I&rsquo;m one of the
      others. Mrs. Lynde says I&rsquo;m full of original sin. No matter how hard I try
      to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are
      naturally good. It&rsquo;s a good deal like geometry, I expect. But don&rsquo;t you
      think the trying so hard ought to count for something? Mrs. Allan is one
      of the naturally good people. I love her passionately. You know there are
      some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off
      without any trouble. And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have
      to try very hard to love. You know you <i>ought</i> to love them because
      they know so much and are such active workers in the church, but you have
      to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget. There
      was another little girl at the manse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday
      school. Her name was Laurette Bradley, and she was a very nice little
      girl. Not exactly a kindred spirit, you know, but still very nice. We had
      an elegant tea, and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well.
      After tea Mrs. Allan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing
      too. Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the
      Sunday-school choir after this. You can&rsquo;t think how I was thrilled at the
      mere thought. I&rsquo;ve longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as Diana
      does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to. Lauretta had
      to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel
      tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta says that the
      Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the
      Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White Sands people to
      recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday. I just
      gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a
      heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything&mdash;about Mrs. Thomas and the
      twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my
      troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs. Allan told
      me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don&rsquo;t know how that encouraged me.
      Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think,
      Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it&rsquo;s a lady. Her name
      is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn&rsquo;t that a romantic name? Mrs. Lynde says they&rsquo;ve
      never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a
      dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid to have a lady
      teacher, and I really don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to live through the two
      weeks before school begins. I&rsquo;m so impatient to see her.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. Anne Comes to Grief in an Affair of Honor
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE had to live
      through more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a month having elapsed
      since the liniment cake episode, it was high time for her to get into
      fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as absentmindedly
      emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry
      instead of into the pigs&rsquo; bucket, and walking clean over the edge of the
      log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative reverie, not really
      being worth counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after the tea at the manse Diana Barry gave a party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small and select,&rdquo; Anne assured Marilla. &ldquo;Just the girls in our class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea,
      when they found themselves in the Barry garden, a little tired of all
      their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might present
      itself. This presently took the form of &ldquo;daring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just
      then. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all
      the silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers
      thereof were &ldquo;dared&rdquo; to do them would fill a book by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point
      in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis,
      albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree
      was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she should
      tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the
      aforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her
      left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right foot
      to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out at the
      third corner and had to confess herself defeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josie&rsquo;s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,
      Anne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which
      bounded the garden to the east. Now, to &ldquo;walk&rdquo; board fences requires more
      skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who has never
      tried it. But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities that make for
      popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly cultivated, for
      walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with an airy unconcern
      which seemed to imply that a little thing like that wasn&rsquo;t worth a &ldquo;dare.&rdquo;
       Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for most of the other girls
      could appreciate it, having suffered many things themselves in their
      efforts to walk fences. Josie descended from her perch, flushed with
      victory, and darted a defiant glance at Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne tossed her red braids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s such a very wonderful thing to walk a little, low,
      board fence,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the
      ridgepole of a roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Josie flatly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody could
      walk a ridgepole. <i>You</i> couldn&rsquo;t, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; cried Anne rashly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I dare you to do it,&rdquo; said Josie defiantly. &ldquo;I dare you to climb up
      there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry&rsquo;s kitchen roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. She
      walked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen
      roof. All the fifth-class girls said, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; partly in excitement, partly
      in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, Anne,&rdquo; entreated Diana. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll fall off and be killed.
      Never mind Josie Pye. It isn&rsquo;t fair to dare anybody to do anything so
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must do it. My honor is at stake,&rdquo; said Anne solemnly. &ldquo;I shall walk
      that ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt. If I am killed you are to
      have my pearl bead ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole,
      balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to walk
      along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up in the
      world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your
      imagination helped you out much. Nevertheless, she managed to take several
      steps before the catastrophe came. Then she swayed, lost her balance,
      stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked roof and
      crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper beneath&mdash;all
      before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous, terrified
      shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended
      Diana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and
      there. Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended
      down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a
      much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had
      rushed frantically around the house&mdash;except Ruby Gillis, who remained
      as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics&mdash;they found Anne
      lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, are you killed?&rdquo; shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees
      beside her friend. &ldquo;Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and
      tell me if you&rsquo;re killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye, who,
      in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible visions of
      a future branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne Shirley&rsquo;s early and
      tragic death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; sobbed Carrie Sloane. &ldquo;Oh, where, Anne?&rdquo; Before Anne could answer
      Mrs. Barry appeared on the scene. At sight of her Anne tried to scramble
      to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Barry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ankle,&rdquo; gasped Anne. &ldquo;Oh, Diana, please find your father and ask him
      to take me home. I know I can never walk there. And I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t
      hop so far on one foot when Jane couldn&rsquo;t even hop around the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when she
      saw Mr. Barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with Mrs. Barry
      beside him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after him. In
      his arms he carried Anne, whose head lay limply against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Marilla had a revelation. In the sudden stab of fear that
      pierced her very heart she realized what Anne had come to mean to her. She
      would have admitted that she liked Anne&mdash;nay, that she was very fond
      of Anne. But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that Anne
      was dearer to her than anything else on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Barry, what has happened to her?&rdquo; she gasped, more white and shaken
      than the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne herself answered, lifting her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be very frightened, Marilla. I was walking the ridgepole and I fell
      off. I expect I have sprained my ankle. But, Marilla, I might have broken
      my neck. Let us look on the bright side of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known you&rsquo;d go and do something of the sort when I let you
      go to that party,&rdquo; said Marilla, sharp and shrewish in her very relief.
      &ldquo;Bring her in here, Mr. Barry, and lay her on the sofa. Mercy me, the
      child has gone and fainted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite true. Overcome by the pain of her injury, Anne had one more
      of her wishes granted to her. She had fainted dead away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway
      dispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the
      injury was more serious than they had supposed. Anne&rsquo;s ankle was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced
      girl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you very sorry for me, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your own fault,&rdquo; said Marilla, twitching down the blind and
      lighting a lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is just why you should be sorry for me,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;because the
      thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I could
      blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would you have
      done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. Such
      absurdity!&rdquo; said Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven&rsquo;t. I just felt that
      I couldn&rsquo;t bear Josie Pye&rsquo;s scorn. She would have crowed over me all my
      life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn&rsquo;t be very
      cross with me, Marilla. It&rsquo;s not a bit nice to faint, after all. And the
      doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. I won&rsquo;t be able to
      go around for six or seven weeks and I&rsquo;ll miss the new lady teacher. She
      won&rsquo;t be new any more by the time I&rsquo;m able to go to school. And Gil&mdash;everybody
      will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted mortal. But I&rsquo;ll try
      to bear it all bravely if only you won&rsquo;t be cross with me, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, I&rsquo;m not cross,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an unlucky child,
      there&rsquo;s no doubt about that; but as you say, you&rsquo;ll have the suffering of
      it. Here now, try and eat some supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fortunate I&rsquo;ve got such an imagination?&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;It will
      help me through splendidly, I expect. What do people who haven&rsquo;t any
      imagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during
      the tedious seven weeks that followed. But she was not solely dependent on
      it. She had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of the
      schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her all
      the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody has been so good and kind, Marilla,&rdquo; sighed Anne happily, on
      the day when she could first limp across the floor. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very
      pleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, Marilla. You
      find out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came to
      see me, and he&rsquo;s really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of course;
      but still I like him and I&rsquo;m awfully sorry I ever criticized his prayers.
      I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into the habit of
      saying them as if he didn&rsquo;t. He could get over that if he&rsquo;d take a little
      trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard I tried to make
      my own little private prayers interesting. He told me all about the time
      he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem so strange to think of
      Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my imagination has its limits,
      for I can&rsquo;t imagine <i>that</i>. When I try to imagine him as a boy I see
      him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just as he looks in Sunday school,
      only small. Now, it&rsquo;s so easy to imagine Mrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs.
      Allan has been to see me fourteen times. Isn&rsquo;t that something to be proud
      of, Marilla? When a minister&rsquo;s wife has so many claims on her time! She is
      such a cheerful person to have visit you, too. She never tells you it&rsquo;s
      your own fault and she hopes you&rsquo;ll be a better girl on account of it.
      Mrs. Lynde always told me that when she came to see me; and she said it in
      a kind of way that made me feel she might hope I&rsquo;d be a better girl but
      didn&rsquo;t really believe I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received
      her as politely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to
      walk a ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark
      burden of remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She&rsquo;s
      been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad
      when I can go to school for I&rsquo;ve heard such exciting things about the new
      teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she has
      the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses
      beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else&rsquo;s in
      Avonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody
      has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it&rsquo;s just glorious to
      think of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie
      has so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are
      preparing a dialogue, called &lsquo;A Morning Visit,&rsquo; for next Friday. And the
      Friday afternoons they don&rsquo;t have recitations Miss Stacy takes them all to
      the woods for a &lsquo;field&rsquo; day and they study ferns and flowers and birds.
      And they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening. Mrs.
      Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a
      lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I believe I shall find
      that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing plain to be seen, Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;and that is
      that your fall off the Barry roof hasn&rsquo;t injured your tongue at all.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIV. Miss Stacy and Her Pupils Get Up a Concert
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was October
      again when Anne was ready to go back to school&mdash;a glorious October,
      all red and gold, with mellow mornings when the valleys were filled with
      delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun
      to drain&mdash;amethyst, pearl, silver, rose, and smoke-blue. The dews
      were so heavy that the fields glistened like cloth of silver and there
      were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of many-stemmed woods to
      run crisply through. The Birch Path was a canopy of yellow and the ferns
      were sear and brown all along it. There was a tang in the very air that
      inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping, unlike snails, swiftly and
      willingly to school; and it <i>was</i> jolly to be back again at the
      little brown desk beside Diana, with Ruby Gillis nodding across the aisle
      and Carrie Sloane sending up notes and Julia Bell passing a &ldquo;chew&rdquo; of gum
      down from the back seat. Anne drew a long breath of happiness as she
      sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture cards in her desk. Life was
      certainly very interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend. Miss Stacy
      was a bright, sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and
      holding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in
      them mentally and morally. Anne expanded like a flower under this
      wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring Matthew and the
      critical Marilla glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Miss Stacy with my whole heart, Marilla. She is so ladylike and
      she has such a sweet voice. When she pronounces my name I feel <i>instinctively</i>
      that she&rsquo;s spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon. I
      just wish you could have been there to hear me recite &lsquo;Mary, Queen of
      Scots.&rsquo; I just put my whole soul into it. Ruby Gillis told me coming home
      that the way I said the line, &lsquo;Now for my father&rsquo;s arm,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;my
      woman&rsquo;s heart farewell,&rsquo; just made her blood run cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, you might recite it for me some of these days, out in the
      barn,&rdquo; suggested Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; said Anne meditatively, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t be able to do it
      so well, I know. It won&rsquo;t be so exciting as it is when you have a whole
      schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words. I know I won&rsquo;t be
      able to make your blood run cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lynde says it made <i>her</i> blood run cold to see the boys
      climbing to the very tops of those big trees on Bell&rsquo;s hill after crows&rsquo; 
      nests last Friday,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;I wonder at Miss Stacy for encouraging
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we wanted a crow&rsquo;s nest for nature study,&rdquo; explained Anne. &ldquo;That was
      on our field afternoon. Field afternoons are splendid, Marilla. And Miss
      Stacy explains everything so beautifully. We have to write compositions on
      our field afternoons and I write the best ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very vain of you to say so then. You&rsquo;d better let your teacher say
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she <i>did</i> say it, Marilla. And indeed I&rsquo;m not vain about it. How
      can I be, when I&rsquo;m such a dunce at geometry? Although I&rsquo;m really beginning
      to see through it a little, too. Miss Stacy makes it so clear. Still, I&rsquo;ll
      never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection. But I
      love writing compositions. Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose our own
      subjects; but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable
      person. It&rsquo;s hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have
      lived. Mustn&rsquo;t it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions
      written about you after you&rsquo;re dead? Oh, I would dearly love to be
      remarkable. I think when I grow up I&rsquo;ll be a trained nurse and go with the
      Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy. That is, if I
      don&rsquo;t go out as a foreign missionary. That would be very romantic, but one
      would have to be very good to be a missionary, and that would be a
      stumbling block. We have physical culture exercises every day, too. They
      make you graceful and promote digestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promote fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said Marilla, who honestly thought it was all
      nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the field afternoons and recitation Fridays and physical culture
      contortions paled before a project which Miss Stacy brought forward in
      November. This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up a
      concert and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night, for the laudable
      purpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag. The pupils one and all
      taking graciously to this plan, the preparations for a program were begun
      at once. And of all the excited performers-elect none was so excited as
      Anne Shirley, who threw herself into the undertaking heart and soul,
      hampered as she was by Marilla&rsquo;s disapproval. Marilla thought it all rank
      foolishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought
      to be put on your lessons,&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t approve of children&rsquo;s
      getting up concerts and racing about to practices. It makes them vain and
      forward and fond of gadding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think of the worthy object,&rdquo; pleaded Anne. &ldquo;A flag will cultivate a
      spirit of patriotism, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fudge! There&rsquo;s precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you.
      All you want is a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn&rsquo;t it all right? Of
      course it&rsquo;s real nice to be getting up a concert. We&rsquo;re going to have six
      choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I&rsquo;m in two dialogues&mdash;&lsquo;The
      Society for the Suppression of Gossip&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Fairy Queen.&rsquo; The boys are
      going to have a dialogue too. And I&rsquo;m to have two recitations, Marilla. I
      just tremble when I think of it, but it&rsquo;s a nice thrilly kind of tremble.
      And we&rsquo;re to have a tableau at the last&mdash;&lsquo;Faith, Hope and Charity.&rsquo; 
      Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with flowing
      hair. I&rsquo;m to be Hope, with my hands clasped&mdash;so&mdash;and my eyes
      uplifted. I&rsquo;m going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don&rsquo;t be
      alarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one of
      them, and it&rsquo;s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla. Josie
      Pye is sulky because she didn&rsquo;t get the part she wanted in the dialogue.
      She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been ridiculous, for who
      ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy queens must be slender.
      Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor.
      Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat
      one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie says. I&rsquo;m to have a wreath of
      white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers
      because I haven&rsquo;t any of my own. It&rsquo;s necessary for fairies to have
      slippers, you know. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine a fairy wearing boots, could you?
      Especially with copper toes? We are going to decorate the hall with
      creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue-paper roses in them. And
      we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated, while Emma
      White plays a march on the organ. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so
      enthusiastic about it as I am, but don&rsquo;t you hope your little Anne will
      distinguish herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I hope is that you&rsquo;ll behave yourself. I&rsquo;ll be heartily glad when all
      this fuss is over and you&rsquo;ll be able to settle down. You are simply good
      for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans
      and tableaus. As for your tongue, it&rsquo;s a marvel it&rsquo;s not clean worn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne sighed and betook herself to the back yard, over which a young new
      moon was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple-green
      western sky, and where Matthew was splitting wood. Anne perched herself on
      a block and talked the concert over with him, sure of an appreciative and
      sympathetic listener in this instance at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I reckon it&rsquo;s going to be a pretty good concert. And I expect
      you&rsquo;ll do your part fine,&rdquo; he said, smiling down into her eager, vivacious
      little face. Anne smiled back at him. Those two were the best of friends
      and Matthew thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had nothing to
      do with bringing her up. That was Marilla&rsquo;s exclusive duty; if it had been
      his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts between inclination
      and said duty. As it was, he was free to, &ldquo;spoil Anne&rdquo;&mdash;Marilla&rsquo;s
      phrasing&mdash;as much as he liked. But it was not such a bad arrangement
      after all; a little &ldquo;appreciation&rdquo; sometimes does quite as much good as
      all the conscientious &ldquo;bringing up&rdquo; in the world.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. Matthew Insists on Puffed Sleeves
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ATTHEW was having
      a bad ten minutes of it. He had come into the kitchen, in the twilight of
      a cold, gray December evening, and had sat down in the woodbox corner to
      take off his heavy boots, unconscious of the fact that Anne and a bevy of
      her schoolmates were having a practice of &ldquo;The Fairy Queen&rdquo; in the sitting
      room. Presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the
      kitchen, laughing and chattering gaily. They did not see Matthew, who
      shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in
      one hand and a bootjack in the other, and he watched them shyly for the
      aforesaid ten minutes as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the
      dialogue and the concert. Anne stood among them, bright eyed and animated
      as they; but Matthew suddenly became conscious that there was something
      about her different from her mates. And what worried Matthew was that the
      difference impressed him as being something that should not exist. Anne
      had a brighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features
      than the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note of
      these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist in any
      of these respects. Then in what did it consist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm in
      arm, down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself to her
      books. He could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be quite sure
      to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she saw between
      Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet
      while Anne never did. This, Matthew felt, would be no great help.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out, much to
      Marilla&rsquo;s disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard reflection Matthew
      arrived at a solution of his problem. Anne was not dressed like the other
      girls!
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that
      Anne never had been dressed like the other girls&mdash;never since she had
      come to Green Gables. Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark dresses, all
      made after the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew there was such a
      thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did; but he was quite sure
      that Anne&rsquo;s sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the other girls
      wore. He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that
      evening&mdash;all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white&mdash;and
      he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was
      bringing her up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served
      thereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty
      dress&mdash;something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that
      he would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an
      unwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off. A
      nice new dress would be the very thing for a present. Matthew, with a sigh
      of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while Marilla opened
      all the doors and aired the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the dress,
      determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It would be, he
      felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew could buy
      and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be at the mercy
      of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl&rsquo;s dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson&rsquo;s store
      instead of William Blair&rsquo;s. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to
      William Blair&rsquo;s; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as
      to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William
      Blair&rsquo;s two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew
      held them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he
      knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter
      as this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he must
      be sure of a man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawson&rsquo;s, where
      Samuel or his son would wait on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his
      business, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife&rsquo;s and
      a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour, big,
      rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She was
      dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that
      glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands.
      Matthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and those
      bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?&rdquo; Miss Lucilla Harris
      inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any&mdash;any&mdash;any&mdash;well now, say any garden rakes?&rdquo;
       stammered Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man
      inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe we have one or two left over,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re upstairs
      in the lumber room. I&rsquo;ll go and see.&rdquo; During her absence Matthew collected
      his scattered senses for another effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired: &ldquo;Anything
      else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?&rdquo; Matthew took his courage in both hands and
      replied: &ldquo;Well now, since you suggest it, I might as well&mdash;take&mdash;that
      is&mdash;look at&mdash;buy some&mdash;some hayseed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She now concluded that
      he was entirely crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only keep hayseed in the spring,&rdquo; she explained loftily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve none
      on hand just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly&mdash;certainly&mdash;just as you say,&rdquo; stammered unhappy
      Matthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he
      recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.
      While Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for a
      final desperate attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t too much trouble&mdash;I might as well&mdash;that
      is&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to look at&mdash;at&mdash;some sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White or brown?&rdquo; queried Miss Harris patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well now&mdash;brown,&rdquo; said Matthew feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a barrel of it over there,&rdquo; said Miss Harris, shaking her bangles
      at it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only kind we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take twenty pounds of it,&rdquo; said Matthew, with beads of
      perspiration standing on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again. It had
      been a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for
      committing the heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached home he
      hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he carried in to Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brown sugar!&rdquo; exclaimed Marilla. &ldquo;Whatever possessed you to get so much?
      You know I never use it except for the hired man&rsquo;s porridge or black fruit
      cake. Jerry&rsquo;s gone and I&rsquo;ve made my cake long ago. It&rsquo;s not good sugar,
      either&mdash;it&rsquo;s coarse and dark&mdash;William Blair doesn&rsquo;t usually keep
      sugar like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought it might come in handy sometime,&rdquo; said Matthew, making
      good his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was
      required to cope with the situation. Marilla was out of the question.
      Matthew felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once.
      Remained only Mrs. Lynde; for of no other woman in Avonlea would Matthew
      have dared to ask advice. To Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly, and that good
      lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick out a dress for you to give Anne? To be sure I will. I&rsquo;m going to
      Carmody tomorrow and I&rsquo;ll attend to it. Have you something particular in
      mind? No? Well, I&rsquo;ll just go by my own judgment then. I believe a nice
      rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria in
      that&rsquo;s real pretty. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like me to make it up for her, too,
      seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it
      before the time and spoil the surprise? Well, I&rsquo;ll do it. No, it isn&rsquo;t a
      mite of trouble. I like sewing. I&rsquo;ll make it to fit my niece, Jenny
      Gillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I&rsquo;m much obliged,&rdquo; said Matthew, &ldquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;I dunno&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;d like&mdash;I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what
      they used to be. If it wouldn&rsquo;t be asking too much I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like them
      made in the new way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puffs? Of course. You needn&rsquo;t worry a speck more about it, Matthew. I&rsquo;ll
      make it up in the very latest fashion,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lynde. To herself she
      added when Matthew had gone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something
      decent for once. The way Marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous,
      that&rsquo;s what, and I&rsquo;ve ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times. I&rsquo;ve
      held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn&rsquo;t want advice and she
      thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she&rsquo;s
      an old maid. But that&rsquo;s always the way. Folks that has brought up children
      know that there&rsquo;s no hard and fast method in the world that&rsquo;ll suit every
      child. But them as never have think it&rsquo;s all as plain and easy as Rule of
      Three&mdash;just set your three terms down so fashion, and the sum &lsquo;ll
      work out correct. But flesh and blood don&rsquo;t come under the head of
      arithmetic and that&rsquo;s where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake. I suppose
      she&rsquo;s trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her as
      she does; but it&rsquo;s more likely to cultivate envy and discontent. I&rsquo;m sure
      the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other
      girls&rsquo;. But to think of Matthew taking notice of it! That man is waking up
      after being asleep for over sixty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla knew all the following fortnight that Matthew had something on his
      mind, but what it was she could not guess, until Christmas Eve, when Mrs.
      Lynde brought up the new dress. Marilla behaved pretty well on the whole,
      although it is very likely she distrusted Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s diplomatic
      explanation that she had made the dress because Matthew was afraid Anne
      would find out about it too soon if Marilla made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and grinning
      about to himself for two weeks, is it?&rdquo; she said a little stiffly but
      tolerantly. &ldquo;I knew he was up to some foolishness. Well, I must say I
      don&rsquo;t think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three good, warm,
      serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer extravagance.
      There&rsquo;s enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist, I declare
      there is. You&rsquo;ll just pamper Anne&rsquo;s vanity, Matthew, and she&rsquo;s as vain as
      a peacock now. Well, I hope she&rsquo;ll be satisfied at last, for I know she&rsquo;s
      been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in, although
      she never said a word after the first. The puffs have been getting bigger
      and more ridiculous right along; they&rsquo;re as big as balloons now. Next year
      anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very
      mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but just
      enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne peeped
      out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs in the
      Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches and wild cherry
      trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were stretches of snowy
      dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that was glorious. Anne ran
      downstairs singing until her voice reechoed through Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn&rsquo;t it a lovely
      Christmas? I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn&rsquo;t
      seem real, does it? I don&rsquo;t like green Christmases. They&rsquo;re not green&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call them green? Why&mdash;why&mdash;Matthew,
      is that for me? Oh, Matthew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and
      held it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be
      contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene out
      of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty
      it was&mdash;a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a
      skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in
      the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.
      But the sleeves&mdash;they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and
      above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of
      brown-silk ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Christmas present for you, Anne,&rdquo; said Matthew shyly. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;Anne,
      don&rsquo;t you like it? Well now&mdash;well now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Anne&rsquo;s eyes had suddenly filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it! Oh, Matthew!&rdquo; Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped her
      hands. &ldquo;Matthew, it&rsquo;s perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you
      enough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy
      dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, let us have breakfast,&rdquo; interrupted Marilla. &ldquo;I must say,
      Anne, I don&rsquo;t think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it for
      you, see that you take good care of it. There&rsquo;s a hair ribbon Mrs. Lynde
      left for you. It&rsquo;s brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to eat breakfast,&rdquo; said Anne rapturously.
      &ldquo;Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I&rsquo;d rather
      feast my eyes on that dress. I&rsquo;m so glad that puffed sleeves are still
      fashionable. It did seem to me that I&rsquo;d never get over it if they went out
      before I had a dress with them. I&rsquo;d never have felt quite satisfied, you
      see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel that I
      ought to be a very good girl indeed. It&rsquo;s at times like this I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m
      not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future.
      But somehow it&rsquo;s hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible
      temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the white
      log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson ulster. Anne
      flew down the slope to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merry Christmas, Diana! And oh, it&rsquo;s a wonderful Christmas. I&rsquo;ve
      something splendid to show you. Matthew has given me the loveliest dress,
      with <i>such</i> sleeves. I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine any nicer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something more for you,&rdquo; said Diana breathlessly. &ldquo;Here&mdash;this
      box. Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in it&mdash;and
      this is for you. I&rsquo;d have brought it over last night, but it didn&rsquo;t come
      until after dark, and I never feel very comfortable coming through the
      Haunted Wood in the dark now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne opened the box and peeped in. First a card with &ldquo;For the Anne-girl
      and Merry Christmas,&rdquo; written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest
      little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening
      buckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;Diana, this is too much. I must be dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it providential,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to borrow Ruby&rsquo;s
      slippers now, and that&rsquo;s a blessing, for they&rsquo;re two sizes too big for
      you, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling. Josie Pye would be
      delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the
      practice night before last. Did you ever hear anything equal to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the
      hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success. The
      little hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but Anne
      was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in the shape
      of Josie Pye, dared not deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hasn&rsquo;t it been a brilliant evening?&rdquo; sighed Anne, when it was all
      over and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything went off very well,&rdquo; said Diana practically. &ldquo;I guess we must
      have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to send an
      account of it to the Charlottetown papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to
      think of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder than
      you did when it was encored. I just said to myself, &lsquo;It is my dear bosom
      friend who is so honored.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one
      was simply splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really
      cannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million
      eyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I was
      sure I couldn&rsquo;t begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves
      and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, Diana. So I
      started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away. I just
      felt like a parrot. It&rsquo;s providential that I practiced those recitations
      so often up in the garret, or I&rsquo;d never have been able to get through. Did
      I groan all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely,&rdquo; assured Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was splendid
      to think I had touched somebody&rsquo;s heart. It&rsquo;s so romantic to take part in
      a concert, isn&rsquo;t it? Oh, it&rsquo;s been a very memorable occasion indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the boys&rsquo; dialogue fine?&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe was just
      splendid. Anne, I do think it&rsquo;s awful mean the way you treat Gil. Wait
      till I tell you. When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue
      one of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil pick it up and put it
      in his breast pocket. There now. You&rsquo;re so romantic that I&rsquo;m sure you
      ought to be pleased at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me what that person does,&rdquo; said Anne loftily. &ldquo;I simply
      never waste a thought on him, Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the
      first time in twenty years, sat for a while by the kitchen fire after Anne
      had gone to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them,&rdquo; said Matthew
      proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; admitted Marilla. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bright child, Matthew. And she
      looked real nice too. I&rsquo;ve been kind of opposed to this concert scheme,
      but I suppose there&rsquo;s no real harm in it after all. Anyhow, I was proud of
      Anne tonight, although I&rsquo;m not going to tell her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I was proud of her and I did tell her so &lsquo;fore she went
      upstairs,&rdquo; said Matthew. &ldquo;We must see what we can do for her some of these
      days, Marilla. I guess she&rsquo;ll need something more than Avonlea school by
      and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s time enough to think of that,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only thirteen
      in March. Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a big girl.
      Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it makes Anne look so
      tall. She&rsquo;s quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do for her
      will be to send her to Queen&rsquo;s after a spell. But nothing need be said
      about that for a year or two yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, it&rsquo;ll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on,&rdquo; said
      Matthew. &ldquo;Things like that are all the better for lots of thinking over.&rdquo;

      found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again. To Anne in
      particular things seemed fearfully flat, stale, and unprofitable after the
      goblet of excitement she had been sipping for weeks. Could she go back to
      the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert? At
      first, as she told Diana, she did not really think she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positively certain, Diana, that life can never be quite the same
      again as it was in those olden days,&rdquo; she said mournfully, as if referring
      to a period of at least fifty years back. &ldquo;Perhaps after a while I&rsquo;ll get
      used to it, but I&rsquo;m afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life. I
      suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them. Marilla is such a
      sensible woman. It must be a great deal better to be sensible; but still,
      I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d really want to be a sensible person, because they are
      so unromantic. Mrs. Lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one,
      but you can never tell. I feel just now that I may grow up to be sensible
      yet. But perhaps that is only because I&rsquo;m tired. I simply couldn&rsquo;t sleep
      last night for ever so long. I just lay awake and imagined the concert
      over and over again. That&rsquo;s one splendid thing about such affairs&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      so lovely to look back to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, however, Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and
      took up its old interests. To be sure, the concert left traces. Ruby
      Gillis and Emma White, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in
      their platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising
      friendship of three years was broken up. Josie Pye and Julia Bell did not
      &ldquo;speak&rdquo; for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright that
      Julia Bell&rsquo;s bow when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken
      jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia. None of the Sloanes would have
      any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared that the
      Sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the Sloanes had retorted
      that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do
      properly. Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson,
      because Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on airs about her
      recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was &ldquo;licked&rdquo;; consequently Moody
      Spurgeon&rsquo;s sister, Ella May, would not &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to Anne Shirley all the
      rest of the winter. With the exception of these trifling frictions, work
      in Miss Stacy&rsquo;s little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter weeks slipped by. It was an unusually mild winter, with so
      little snow that Anne and Diana could go to school nearly every day by way
      of the Birch Path. On Anne&rsquo;s birthday they were tripping lightly down it,
      keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss Stacy had
      told them that they must soon write a composition on &ldquo;A Winter&rsquo;s Walk in
      the Woods,&rdquo; and it behooved them to be observant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think, Diana, I&rsquo;m thirteen years old today,&rdquo; remarked Anne in an
      awed voice. &ldquo;I can scarcely realize that I&rsquo;m in my teens. When I woke this
      morning it seemed to me that everything must be different. You&rsquo;ve been
      thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t seem such a novelty to you
      as it does to me. It makes life seem so much more interesting. In two more
      years I&rsquo;ll be really grown up. It&rsquo;s a great comfort to think that I&rsquo;ll be
      able to use big words then without being laughed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she&rsquo;s fifteen,&rdquo; said
      Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,&rdquo; said Anne disdainfully. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take-notice for all
      she pretends to be so mad. But I&rsquo;m afraid that is an uncharitable speech.
      Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do
      slip out so often before you think, don&rsquo;t they? I simply can&rsquo;t talk about
      Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at
      all. You may have noticed that. I&rsquo;m trying to be as much like Mrs. Allan
      as I possibly can, for I think she&rsquo;s perfect. Mr. Allan thinks so too.
      Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesn&rsquo;t
      really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a
      mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their
      besetting sins just like everybody else. I had such an interesting talk
      with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon. There are just
      a few things it&rsquo;s proper to talk about on Sundays and that is one of them.
      My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties. I&rsquo;m
      striving very hard to overcome it and now that I&rsquo;m really thirteen perhaps
      I&rsquo;ll get on better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In four more years we&rsquo;ll be able to put our hair up,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;Alice
      Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think that&rsquo;s
      ridiculous. I shall wait until I&rsquo;m seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had Alice Bell&rsquo;s crooked nose,&rdquo; said Anne decidedly, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;but
      there! I won&rsquo;t say what I was going to because it was extremely
      uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and that&rsquo;s
      vanity. I&rsquo;m afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I heard that
      compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to me. Oh,
      Diana, look, there&rsquo;s a rabbit. That&rsquo;s something to remember for our woods
      composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in
      summer. They&rsquo;re so white and still, as if they were asleep and dreaming
      pretty dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t mind writing that composition when its time comes,&rdquo; sighed Diana.
      &ldquo;I can manage to write about the woods, but the one we&rsquo;re to hand in
      Monday is terrible. The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a story out
      of our own heads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s as easy as wink,&rdquo; said Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for you because you have an imagination,&rdquo; retorted Diana, &ldquo;but
      what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose you have
      your composition all done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing
      miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote it last Monday evening. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;The Jealous Rival; or In
      Death Not Divided.&rsquo; I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and
      nonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is the
      kind of critic I like. It&rsquo;s a sad, sweet story. I just cried like a child
      while I was writing it. It&rsquo;s about two beautiful maidens called Cordelia
      Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village and were
      devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette with a
      coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was a queenly
      blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anybody with purple eyes,&rdquo; said Diana dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the
      common. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I&rsquo;ve found out what an
      alabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You
      know so much more than you did when you were only twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?&rdquo; asked Diana, who was
      beginning to feel rather interested in their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram
      DeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair
      Geraldine. He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a
      carriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles;
      because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found it
      rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by.
      I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because I
      thought she&rsquo;d likely be an authority on the subject, having so many
      sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm
      Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan that his
      dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, &lsquo;What do you
      say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?&rsquo; And Susan said, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know&mdash;let me see&rsquo;&mdash;and there they were, engaged as quick
      as that. But I didn&rsquo;t think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic
      one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could. I made it
      very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees, although Ruby
      Gillis says it isn&rsquo;t done nowadays. Geraldine accepted him in a speech a
      page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech. I
      rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my masterpiece. Bertram gave
      her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her they would go to
      Europe for a wedding tour, for he was immensely wealthy. But then, alas,
      shadows began to darken over their path. Cordelia was secretly in love
      with Bertram herself and when Geraldine told her about the engagement she
      was simply furious, especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond
      ring. All her affection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed
      that she should never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be Geraldine&rsquo;s
      friend the same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over
      a rushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed
      Geraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha.&rsquo; But Bertram
      saw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, &lsquo;I will
      save thee, my peerless Geraldine.&rsquo; But alas, he had forgotten he couldn&rsquo;t
      swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms. Their
      bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the one
      grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. It&rsquo;s so much more
      romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for Cordelia,
      she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum. I
      thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfectly lovely!&rdquo; sighed Diana, who belonged to Matthew&rsquo;s school of
      critics. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can make up such thrilling things out of
      your own head, Anne. I wish my imagination was as good as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be if you&rsquo;d only cultivate it,&rdquo; said Anne cheeringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
      thought of a plan, Diana. Let you and me have a story club all our own and
      write stories for practice. I&rsquo;ll help you along until you can do them by
      yourself. You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know. Miss Stacy
      says so. Only we must take the right way. I told her about the Haunted
      Wood, but she said we went the wrong way about it in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was how the story club came into existence. It was limited to Diana
      and Anne at first, but soon it was extended to include Jane Andrews and
      Ruby Gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations needed
      cultivating. No boys were allowed in it&mdash;although Ruby Gillis opined
      that their admission would make it more exciting&mdash;and each member had
      to produce one story a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely interesting,&rdquo; Anne told Marilla. &ldquo;Each girl has to read
      her story out loud and then we talk it over. We are going to keep them all
      sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. We each write under a
      nom-de-plume. Mine is Rosamond Montmorency. All the girls do pretty well.
      Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental. She puts too much lovemaking into her
      stories and you know too much is worse than too little. Jane never puts
      any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it
      out loud. Jane&rsquo;s stories are extremely sensible. Then Diana puts too many
      murders into hers. She says most of the time she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do
      with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them. I mostly always
      have to tell them what to write about, but that isn&rsquo;t hard for I&rsquo;ve
      millions of ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet,&rdquo; scoffed
      Marilla. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time
      that should be put on your lessons. Reading stories is bad enough but
      writing them is worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re so careful to put a moral into them all, Marilla,&rdquo; explained
      Anne. &ldquo;I insist upon that. All the good people are rewarded and all the
      bad ones are suitably punished. I&rsquo;m sure that must have a wholesome
      effect. The moral is the great thing. Mr. Allan says so. I read one of my
      stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was
      excellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when
      people cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic
      parts. Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt
      Josephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. So we
      copied out four of our very best and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry wrote
      back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. That kind of
      puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost everybody
      died. But I&rsquo;m glad Miss Barry liked them. It shows our club is doing some
      good in the world. Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our object in
      everything. I do really try to make it my object but I forget so often
      when I&rsquo;m having fun. I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan when I
      grow up. Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t say there was a great deal&rdquo; was Marilla&rsquo;s encouraging answer.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly, forgetful little girl as you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but she wasn&rsquo;t always so good as she is now either,&rdquo; said Anne
      seriously. &ldquo;She told me so herself&mdash;that is, she said she was a
      dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes.
      I felt so encouraged when I heard that. Is it very wicked of me, Marilla,
      to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and
      mischievous? Mrs. Lynde says it is. Mrs. Lynde says she always feels
      shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how
      small they were. Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that
      when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt&rsquo;s pantry and
      she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      felt that way. I&rsquo;d have thought that it was real noble of him to confess
      it, and I&rsquo;d have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small
      boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that
      perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it. That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d
      feel, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way I feel at present, Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;is that it&rsquo;s high time
      you had those dishes washed. You&rsquo;ve taken half an hour longer than you
      should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk afterwards.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. Vanity and Vexation of Spirit
    </h2>
    <p>
      Marilla, walking home one late April evening from an Aid meeting, realized
      that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring
      never fails to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest
      and merriest. Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts
      and feelings. She probably imagined that she was thinking about the Aids
      and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room, but under
      these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking
      into pale-purply mists in the declining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir
      shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded
      maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a
      stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod. The spring was abroad in the
      land and Marilla&rsquo;s sober, middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because
      of its deep, primal gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables, peering through its network
      of trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in several
      little coruscations of glory. Marilla, as she picked her steps along the
      damp lane, thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was
      going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for
      tea, instead of to the cold comfort of old Aid meeting evenings before
      Anne had come to Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black
      out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and
      irritated. She had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five
      o&rsquo;clock, but now she must hurry to take off her second-best dress and
      prepare the meal herself against Matthew&rsquo;s return from plowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle Miss Anne when she comes home,&rdquo; said Marilla grimly, as she
      shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was
      strictly necessary. Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for his
      tea in his corner. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing
      stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never
      thinking once about the time or her duties. She&rsquo;s just got to be pulled up
      short and sudden on this sort of thing. I don&rsquo;t care if Mrs. Allan does
      say she&rsquo;s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. She may be
      bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there&rsquo;s
      never any knowing what shape it&rsquo;ll break out in next. Just as soon as she
      grows out of one freak she takes up with another. But there! Here I am
      saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the
      Aid today. I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for if she
      hadn&rsquo;t I know I&rsquo;d have said something too sharp to Rachel before
      everybody. Anne&rsquo;s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it from
      me to deny it. But I&rsquo;m bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who&rsquo;d pick
      faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea. Just the same,
      Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was
      to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must say, with all
      her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I&rsquo;m
      real sorry to find her so now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I dunno,&rdquo; said Matthew, who, being patient and wise and, above
      all, hungry, had deemed it best to let Marilla talk her wrath out
      unhindered, having learned by experience that she got through with
      whatever work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely
      argument. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re judging her too hasty, Marilla. Don&rsquo;t call her
      untrustworthy until you&rsquo;re sure she has disobeyed you. Mebbe it can all be
      explained&mdash;Anne&rsquo;s a great hand at explaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here when I told her to stay,&rdquo; retorted Marilla. &ldquo;I reckon
      she&rsquo;ll find it hard to explain <i>that</i> to my satisfaction. Of course I
      knew you&rsquo;d take her part, Matthew. But I&rsquo;m bringing her up, not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dark when supper was ready, and still no sign of Anne, coming
      hurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover&rsquo;s Lane, breathless and repentant
      with a sense of neglected duties. Marilla washed and put away the dishes
      grimly. Then, wanting a candle to light her way down the cellar, she went
      up to the east gable for the one that generally stood on Anne&rsquo;s table.
      Lighting it, she turned around to see Anne herself lying on the bed, face
      downward among the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us,&rdquo; said astonished Marilla, &ldquo;have you been asleep, Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the muffled reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sick then?&rdquo; demanded Marilla anxiously, going over to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself
      forever from mortal eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But please, Marilla, go away and don&rsquo;t look at me. I&rsquo;m in the depths
      of despair and I don&rsquo;t care who gets head in class or writes the best
      composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more. Little things
      like that are of no importance now because I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll ever be
      able to go anywhere again. My career is closed. Please, Marilla, go away
      and don&rsquo;t look at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did anyone ever hear the like?&rdquo; the mystified Marilla wanted to know.
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, whatever is the matter with you? What have you done? Get
      right up this minute and tell me. This minute, I say. There now, what is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at my hair, Marilla,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Marilla lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at Anne&rsquo;s
      hair, flowing in heavy masses down her back. It certainly had a very
      strange appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, what have you done to your hair? Why, it&rsquo;s <i>green!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Green it might be called, if it were any earthly color&mdash;a queer,
      dull, bronzy green, with streaks here and there of the original red to
      heighten the ghastly effect. Never in all her life had Marilla seen
      anything so grotesque as Anne&rsquo;s hair at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s green,&rdquo; moaned Anne. &ldquo;I thought nothing could be as bad as red
      hair. But now I know it&rsquo;s ten times worse to have green hair. Oh, Marilla,
      you little know how utterly wretched I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I little know how you got into this fix, but I mean to find out,&rdquo; said
      Marilla. &ldquo;Come right down to the kitchen&mdash;it&rsquo;s too cold up here&mdash;and
      tell me just what you&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;ve been expecting something queer for
      some time. You haven&rsquo;t got into any scrape for over two months, and I was
      sure another one was due. Now, then, what did you do to your hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dyed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dyed it! Dyed your hair! Anne Shirley, didn&rsquo;t you know it was a wicked
      thing to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew it was a little wicked,&rdquo; admitted Anne. &ldquo;But I thought it was
      worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair. I counted the
      cost, Marilla. Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marilla sarcastically, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d decided it was worth while to
      dye my hair I&rsquo;d have dyed it a decent color at least. I wouldn&rsquo;t have dyed
      it green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t mean to dye it green, Marilla,&rdquo; protested Anne dejectedly.
      &ldquo;If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He said it would
      turn my hair a beautiful raven black&mdash;he positively assured me that
      it would. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels like
      to have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect
      anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they&rsquo;re not.
      I have proof now&mdash;green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I
      hadn&rsquo;t then and I believed every word he said <i>implicitly</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said? Who are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The peddler that was here this afternoon. I bought the dye from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, how often have I told you never to let one of those
      Italians in the house! I don&rsquo;t believe in encouraging them to come around
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t let him in the house. I remembered what you told me, and I
      went out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step.
      Besides, he wasn&rsquo;t an Italian&mdash;he was a German Jew. He had a big box
      full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make
      enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He spoke so
      feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy something
      from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once I saw the
      bottle of hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a
      beautiful raven black and wouldn&rsquo;t wash off. In a trice I saw myself with
      beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was irresistible. But the
      price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I had only fifty cents left
      out of my chicken money. I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he
      said that, seeing it was me, he&rsquo;d sell it for fifty cents and that was
      just giving it away. So I bought it, and as soon as he had gone I came up
      here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said. I used
      up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it
      turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you. And I&rsquo;ve been
      repenting ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll repent to good purpose,&rdquo; said Marilla severely, &ldquo;and
      that you&rsquo;ve got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you, Anne.
      Goodness knows what&rsquo;s to be done. I suppose the first thing is to give
      your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and
      water, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been
      scouring its original red. The peddler had certainly spoken the truth when
      he declared that the dye wouldn&rsquo;t wash off, however his veracity might be
      impeached in other respects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?&rdquo; questioned Anne in tears. &ldquo;I can never
      live this down. People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes&mdash;the
      liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with Mrs.
      Lynde. But they&rsquo;ll never forget this. They will think I am not
      respectable. Oh, Marilla, &lsquo;what a tangled web we weave when first we
      practice to deceive.&rsquo; That is poetry, but it is true. And oh, how Josie
      Pye will laugh! Marilla, I <i>cannot</i> face Josie Pye. I am the
      unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s unhappiness continued for a week. During that time she went nowhere
      and shampooed her hair every day. Diana alone of outsiders knew the fatal
      secret, but she promised solemnly never to tell, and it may be stated here
      and now that she kept her word. At the end of the week Marilla said
      decidedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Anne. That is fast dye if ever there was any. Your hair must
      be cut off; there is no other way. You can&rsquo;t go out with it looking like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of Marilla&rsquo;s
      remarks. With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please cut it off at once, Marilla, and have it over. Oh, I feel that my
      heart is broken. This is such an unromantic affliction. The girls in books
      lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed, and
      I&rsquo;m sure I wouldn&rsquo;t mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much.
      But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you&rsquo;ve
      dyed it a dreadful color, is there? I&rsquo;m going to weep all the time you&rsquo;re
      cutting it off, if it won&rsquo;t interfere. It seems such a tragic thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne wept then, but later on, when she went upstairs and looked in the
      glass, she was calm with despair. Marilla had done her work thoroughly and
      it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible. The
      result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be. Anne
      promptly turned her glass to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she suddenly righted the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will, too. I&rsquo;d do penance for being wicked that way. I&rsquo;ll look at
      myself every time I come to my room and see how ugly I am. And I won&rsquo;t try
      to imagine it away, either. I never thought I was vain about my hair, of
      all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being red, because it
      was so long and thick and curly. I expect something will happen to my nose
      next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday,
      but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie
      Pye, who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she looked like a
      perfect scarecrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything when Josie said that to me,&rdquo; Anne confided that
      evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches,
      &ldquo;because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it
      patiently. It&rsquo;s hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I wanted to
      say something back. But I didn&rsquo;t. I just swept her one scornful look and
      then I forgave her. It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive
      people, doesn&rsquo;t it? I mean to devote all my energies to being good after
      this and I shall never try to be beautiful again. Of course it&rsquo;s better to
      be good. I know it is, but it&rsquo;s sometimes so hard to believe a thing even
      when you know it. I do really want to be good, Marilla, like you and Mrs.
      Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a credit to you. Diana says when
      my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a
      bow at one side. She says she thinks it will be very becoming. I will call
      it a snood&mdash;that sounds so romantic. But am I talking too much,
      Marilla? Does it hurt your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head is better now. It was terrible bad this afternoon, though. These
      headaches of mine are getting worse and worse. I&rsquo;ll have to see a doctor
      about them. As for your chatter, I don&rsquo;t know that I mind it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      got so used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which was Marilla&rsquo;s way of saying that she liked to hear it.

      there&rsquo;s two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up. It&rsquo;s fun then.
      But to lie down and pretend I was dead&mdash;I just couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d die
      really of fright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it would be romantic,&rdquo; conceded Jane Andrews, &ldquo;but I know I
      couldn&rsquo;t keep still. I&rsquo;d be popping up every minute or so to see where I
      was and if I wasn&rsquo;t drifting too far out. And you know, Anne, that would
      spoil the effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine,&rdquo; mourned Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not afraid to float down and I&rsquo;d love to be Elaine. But it&rsquo;s ridiculous
      just the same. Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has such
      lovely long golden hair&mdash;Elaine had &lsquo;all her bright hair streaming
      down,&rsquo; you know. And Elaine was the lily maid. Now, a red-haired person
      cannot be a lily maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Diana earnestly, &ldquo;and
      your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do you really think so?&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, flushing sensitively with
      delight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought it was myself&mdash;but I never dared to
      ask anyone for fear she would tell me it wasn&rsquo;t. Do you think it could be
      called auburn now, Diana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I think it is real pretty,&rdquo; said Diana, looking admiringly at
      the short, silky curls that clustered over Anne&rsquo;s head and were held in
      place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing on the bank of the pond, below Orchard Slope, where a
      little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip was
      a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience of
      fishermen and duck hunters. Ruby and Jane were spending the midsummer
      afternoon with Diana, and Anne had come over to play with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne and Diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about
      the pond. Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly cut
      down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring. Anne
      had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the romance of
      it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and Diana said,
      big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for such childish
      amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating sports to be
      found about the pond. It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge
      and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little
      flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Anne&rsquo;s idea that they dramatize Elaine. They had studied Tennyson&rsquo;s
      poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of Education
      having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince Edward Island
      schools. They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to pieces in general
      until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all left in it for them,
      but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and Guinevere and King Arthur
      had become very real people to them, and Anne was devoured by secret
      regret that she had not been born in Camelot. Those days, she said, were
      so much more romantic than the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if
      the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with
      the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland
      lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often gone down
      like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing Elaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be Elaine,&rdquo; said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although she
      would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet her
      artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her limitations
      made impossible. &ldquo;Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane will be Guinevere
      and Diana must be Lancelot. But first you must be the brothers and the
      father. We can&rsquo;t have the old dumb servitor because there isn&rsquo;t room for
      two in the flat when one is lying down. We must pall the barge all its
      length in blackest samite. That old black shawl of your mother&rsquo;s will be
      just the thing, Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and
      then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she does look really dead,&rdquo; whispered Ruby Gillis nervously, watching
      the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches.
      &ldquo;It makes me feel frightened, girls. Do you suppose it&rsquo;s really right to
      act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is abominably wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruby, you shouldn&rsquo;t talk about Mrs. Lynde,&rdquo; said Anne severely. &ldquo;It
      spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde was
      born. Jane, you arrange this. It&rsquo;s silly for Elaine to be talking when
      she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but
      an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute. A
      white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue
      iris placed in one of Anne&rsquo;s folded hands was all that could be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, she&rsquo;s all ready,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;We must kiss her quiet brows and,
      Diana, you say, &lsquo;Sister, farewell forever,&rsquo; and Ruby, you say, &lsquo;Farewell,
      sweet sister,&rsquo; both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly can. Anne, for
      goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine &lsquo;lay as though she smiled.&rsquo; 
      That&rsquo;s better. Now push the flat off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old embedded
      stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long enough to
      see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering
      up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower headland
      where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be in
      readiness to receive the lily maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her
      situation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The
      flat began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine to
      scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of
      blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge
      through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at the
      landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne did not
      know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a
      dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it
      could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left behind at the
      landing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was white
      to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession. There was one
      chance&mdash;just one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was horribly frightened,&rdquo; she told Mrs. Allan the next day, &ldquo;and it
      seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the
      water rising in it every moment. I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly, but
      I didn&rsquo;t shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save me
      was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me
      to climb up on it. You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there
      are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them. It was proper to pray, but
      I had to do my part by watching out and right well I knew it. I just said,
      &lsquo;Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile and I&rsquo;ll do the rest,&rsquo; 
      over and over again. Under such circumstances you don&rsquo;t think much about
      making a flowery prayer. But mine was answered, for the flat bumped right
      into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my
      shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub. And there I was,
      Mrs. Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up
      or down. It was a very unromantic position, but I didn&rsquo;t think about that
      at the time. You don&rsquo;t think much about romance when you have just escaped
      from a watery grave. I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all
      my attention to holding on tight, for I knew I should probably have to
      depend on human aid to get back to dry land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream.
      Ruby, Jane, and Diana, already awaiting it on the lower headland, saw it
      disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that Anne had
      gone down with it. For a moment they stood still, white as sheets, frozen
      with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of their voices,
      they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never pausing as they
      crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge. Anne, clinging
      desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying forms and heard
      their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her position was a very
      uncomfortable one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid.
      Why didn&rsquo;t somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they had
      fainted, one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she grew so tired
      and cramped that she could hold on no longer! Anne looked at the wicked
      green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and shivered.
      Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her arms
      and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the bridge in
      Harmon Andrews&rsquo;s dory!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white
      scornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also scornful
      gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley! How on earth did you get there?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his
      hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe&rsquo;s hand,
      scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious, in the
      stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was certainly
      extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened, Anne?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, taking up his oars. &ldquo;We were
      playing Elaine&rdquo; explained Anne frigidly, without even looking at her
      rescuer, &ldquo;and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge&mdash;I mean the
      flat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile. The girls went
      for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance,
      sprang nimbly on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you,&rdquo; she said haughtily as she turned away. But
      Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand on her
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, &ldquo;look here. Can&rsquo;t we be good friends? I&rsquo;m
      awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I didn&rsquo;t mean to vex you
      and I only meant it for a joke. Besides, it&rsquo;s so long ago. I think your
      hair is awfully pretty now&mdash;honest I do. Let&rsquo;s be friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Anne hesitated. She had an odd, newly awakened consciousness
      under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy, half-eager expression in
      Gilbert&rsquo;s hazel eyes was something that was very good to see. Her heart
      gave a quick, queer little beat. But the bitterness of her old grievance
      promptly stiffened up her wavering determination. That scene of two years
      before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken
      place yesterday. Gilbert had called her &ldquo;carrots&rdquo; and had brought about
      her disgrace before the whole school. Her resentment, which to other and
      older people might be as laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed
      and softened by time seemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never
      forgive him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert Blythe;
      and I don&rsquo;t want to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his
      cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley. And I don&rsquo;t
      care either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep,
      ferny little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but she
      was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She almost wished she had
      answered Gilbert differently. Of course, he had insulted her terribly, but
      still&mdash;! Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to sit
      down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the reaction
      from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in a
      state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at
      Orchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had
      succumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she
      might, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the
      brook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla had
      gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anne,&rdquo; gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former&rsquo;s neck and weeping
      with relief and delight, &ldquo;oh, Anne&mdash;we thought&mdash;you were&mdash;drowned&mdash;and
      we felt like murderers&mdash;because we had made&mdash;you be&mdash;Elaine.
      And Ruby is in hysterics&mdash;oh, Anne, how did you escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I climbed up on one of the piles,&rdquo; explained Anne wearily, &ldquo;and Gilbert
      Blythe came along in Mr. Andrews&rsquo;s dory and brought me to land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it&rsquo;s so romantic!&rdquo; said Jane, finding
      breath enough for utterance at last. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll speak to him after
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old
      spirit. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want ever to hear the word &lsquo;romantic&rsquo; again, Jane
      Andrews. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my
      fault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do gets
      me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We&rsquo;ve gone and lost your father&rsquo;s
      flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we&rsquo;ll not be allowed to row on
      the pond any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to
      do. Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households when
      the events of the afternoon became known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ever have any sense, Anne?&rdquo; groaned Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla,&rdquo; returned Anne optimistically. A good
      cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed her
      nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. &ldquo;I think my prospects
      of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; said Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; explained Anne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a new and valuable lesson today.
      Ever since I came to Green Gables I&rsquo;ve been making mistakes, and each
      mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of the
      amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn&rsquo;t belong to me.
      The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with
      me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking. Dyeing
      my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair and nose now&mdash;at
      least, very seldom. And today&rsquo;s mistake is going to cure me of being too
      romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be
      romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot
      hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now. I feel quite
      sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect,
      Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; said Marilla skeptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on
      Anne&rsquo;s shoulder when Marilla had gone out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up all your romance, Anne,&rdquo; he whispered shyly, &ldquo;a little of
      it is a good thing&mdash;not too much, of course&mdash;but keep a little
      of it, Anne, keep a little of it.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXIX. An Epoch in Anne&rsquo;s Life
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE was bringing
      the cows home from the back pasture by way of Lover&rsquo;s Lane. It was a
      September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were brimmed
      up with ruby sunset light. Here and there the lane was splashed with it,
      but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples, and
      the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy
      wine. The winds were out in their tops, and there is no sweeter music on
      earth than that which the wind makes in the fir trees at evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cows swung placidly down the lane, and Anne followed them dreamily,
      repeating aloud the battle canto from <i>Marmion</i>&mdash;which had also
      been part of their English course the preceding winter and which Miss
      Stacy had made them learn off by heart&mdash;and exulting in its rushing
      lines and the clash of spears in its imagery. When she came to the lines
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       The stubborn spearsmen still made good
       Their dark impenetrable wood,
</pre>
    <p>
      she stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy
      herself one of that heroic ring. When she opened them again it was to
      behold Diana coming through the gate that led into the Barry field and
      looking so important that Anne instantly divined there was news to be
      told. But betray too eager curiosity she would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this evening just like a purple dream, Diana? It makes me so glad
      to be alive. In the mornings I always think the mornings are best; but
      when evening comes I think it&rsquo;s lovelier still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very fine evening,&rdquo; said Diana, &ldquo;but oh, I have such news, Anne.
      Guess. You can have three guesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charlotte Gillis is going to be married in the church after all and Mrs.
      Allan wants us to decorate it,&rdquo; cried Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Charlotte&rsquo;s beau won&rsquo;t agree to that, because nobody ever has been
      married in the church yet, and he thinks it would seem too much like a
      funeral. It&rsquo;s too mean, because it would be such fun. Guess again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane&rsquo;s mother is going to let her have a birthday party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana shook her head, her black eyes dancing with merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what it can be,&rdquo; said Anne in despair, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s that
      Moody Spurgeon MacPherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night. Did
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; exclaimed Diana indignantly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be likely
      to boast of it if he did, the horrid creature! I knew you couldn&rsquo;t guess
      it. Mother had a letter from Aunt Josephine today, and Aunt Josephine
      wants you and me to go to town next Tuesday and stop with her for the
      Exhibition. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana,&rdquo; whispered Anne, finding it necessary to lean up against a
      maple tree for support, &ldquo;do you really mean it? But I&rsquo;m afraid Marilla
      won&rsquo;t let me go. She will say that she can&rsquo;t encourage gadding about. That
      was what she said last week when Jane invited me to go with them in their
      double-seated buggy to the American concert at the White Sands Hotel. I
      wanted to go, but Marilla said I&rsquo;d be better at home learning my lessons
      and so would Jane. I was bitterly disappointed, Diana. I felt so
      heartbroken that I wouldn&rsquo;t say my prayers when I went to bed. But I
      repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Diana, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get Mother to ask Marilla. She&rsquo;ll be
      more likely to let you go then; and if she does we&rsquo;ll have the time of our
      lives, Anne. I&rsquo;ve never been to an Exhibition, and it&rsquo;s so aggravating to
      hear the other girls talking about their trips. Jane and Ruby have been
      twice, and they&rsquo;re going this year again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go or
      not,&rdquo; said Anne resolutely. &ldquo;If I did and then was disappointed, it would
      be more than I could bear. But in case I do go I&rsquo;m very glad my new coat
      will be ready by that time. Marilla didn&rsquo;t think I needed a new coat. She
      said my old one would do very well for another winter and that I ought to
      be satisfied with having a new dress. The dress is very pretty, Diana&mdash;navy
      blue and made so fashionably. Marilla always makes my dresses fashionably
      now, because she says she doesn&rsquo;t intend to have Matthew going to Mrs.
      Lynde to make them. I&rsquo;m so glad. It is ever so much easier to be good if
      your clothes are fashionable. At least, it is easier for me. I suppose it
      doesn&rsquo;t make such a difference to naturally good people. But Matthew said
      I must have a new coat, so Marilla bought a lovely piece of blue
      broadcloth, and it&rsquo;s being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody. It&rsquo;s
      to be done Saturday night, and I&rsquo;m trying not to imagine myself walking up
      the church aisle on Sunday in my new suit and cap, because I&rsquo;m afraid it
      isn&rsquo;t right to imagine such things. But it just slips into my mind in
      spite of me. My cap is so pretty. Matthew bought it for me the day we were
      over at Carmody. It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all
      the rage, with gold cord and tassels. Your new hat is elegant, Diana, and
      so becoming. When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled
      with pride to think you were my dearest friend. Do you suppose it&rsquo;s wrong
      for us to think so much about our clothes? Marilla says it is very sinful.
      But it is such an interesting subject, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla agreed to let Anne go to town, and it was arranged that Mr. Barry
      should take the girls in on the following Tuesday. As Charlottetown was
      thirty miles away and Mr. Barry wished to go and return the same day, it
      was necessary to make a very early start. But Anne counted it all joy, and
      was up before sunrise on Tuesday morning. A glance from her window assured
      her that the day would be fine, for the eastern sky behind the firs of the
      Haunted Wood was all silvery and cloudless. Through the gap in the trees a
      light was shining in the western gable of Orchard Slope, a token that
      Diana was also up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was dressed by the time Matthew had the fire on and had the breakfast
      ready when Marilla came down, but for her own part was much too excited to
      eat. After breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned, and Anne
      hastened over the brook and up through the firs to Orchard Slope. Mr.
      Barry and Diana were waiting for her, and they were soon on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long drive, but Anne and Diana enjoyed every minute of it. It was
      delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight
      that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields. The air was fresh and
      crisp, and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys and floated
      off from the hills. Sometimes the road went through woods where maples
      were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it crossed rivers on
      bridges that made Anne&rsquo;s flesh cringe with the old, half-delightful fear;
      sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of
      weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of
      curving upland or misty-blue sky could be seen; but wherever it went there
      was much of interest to discuss. It was almost noon when they reached town
      and found their way to &ldquo;Beechwood.&rdquo; It was quite a fine old mansion, set
      back from the street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches.
      Miss Barry met them at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come to see me at last, you Anne-girl,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mercy,
      child, how you have grown! You&rsquo;re taller than I am, I declare. And you&rsquo;re
      ever so much better looking than you used to be, too. But I dare say you
      know that without being told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne radiantly. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not so freckled as I
      used to be, so I&rsquo;ve much to be thankful for, but I really hadn&rsquo;t dared to
      hope there was any other improvement. I&rsquo;m so glad you think there is, Miss
      Barry.&rdquo; Miss Barry&rsquo;s house was furnished with &ldquo;great magnificence,&rdquo; as
      Anne told Marilla afterward. The two little country girls were rather
      abashed by the splendor of the parlor where Miss Barry left them when she
      went to see about dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just like a palace?&rdquo; whispered Diana. &ldquo;I never was in Aunt
      Josephine&rsquo;s house before, and I&rsquo;d no idea it was so grand. I just wish
      Julia Bell could see this&mdash;she puts on such airs about her mother&rsquo;s
      parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Velvet carpet,&rdquo; sighed Anne luxuriously, &ldquo;and silk curtains! I&rsquo;ve dreamed
      of such things, Diana. But do you know I don&rsquo;t believe I feel very
      comfortable with them after all. There are so many things in this room and
      all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination. That is one
      consolation when you are poor&mdash;there are so many more things you can
      imagine about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their sojourn in town was something that Anne and Diana dated from for
      years. From first to last it was crowded with delights.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept them
      there all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was splendid,&rdquo; Anne related to Marilla later on. &ldquo;I never imagined
      anything so interesting. I don&rsquo;t really know which department was the most
      interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the fancywork
      best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was real glad she
      did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I&rsquo;m improving, don&rsquo;t
      you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie&rsquo;s success? Mr. Harmon
      Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples and Mr. Bell took first
      prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was ridiculous for a
      Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs, but I don&rsquo;t see why.
      Do you? She said she would always think of it after this when he was
      praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a prize for painting,
      and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese. So Avonlea
      was pretty well represented, wasn&rsquo;t it? Mrs. Lynde was there that day, and
      I never knew how much I really liked her until I saw her familiar face
      among all those strangers. There were thousands of people there, Marilla.
      It made me feel dreadfully insignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the
      grandstand to see the horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn&rsquo;t go; she said horse
      racing was an abomination and, she being a church member, thought it her
      bounden duty to set a good example by staying away. But there were so many
      there I don&rsquo;t believe Mrs. Lynde&rsquo;s absence would ever be noticed. I don&rsquo;t
      think, though, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they
      <i>are</i> awfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to
      bet me ten cents that the red horse would win. I didn&rsquo;t believe he would,
      but I refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about
      everything, and I felt sure it wouldn&rsquo;t do to tell her that. It&rsquo;s always
      wrong to do anything you can&rsquo;t tell the minister&rsquo;s wife. It&rsquo;s as good as
      an extra conscience to have a minister&rsquo;s wife for your friend. And I was
      very glad I didn&rsquo;t bet, because the red horse <i>did</i> win, and I would
      have lost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a
      man go up in a balloon. I&rsquo;d love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would
      be simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten
      cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave
      Diana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I
      would marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go
      across water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after
      that, but I didn&rsquo;t care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose it&rsquo;s
      too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a
      never-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldn&rsquo;t sleep at
      night. Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. It was
      an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in a spare room isn&rsquo;t what
      I used to think it was. That&rsquo;s the worst of growing up, and I&rsquo;m beginning
      to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a child don&rsquo;t
      seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thursday the girls had a drive in the park, and in the evening Miss Barry
      took them to a concert in the Academy of Music, where a noted prima donna
      was to sing. To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, it was beyond description. I was so excited I couldn&rsquo;t even
      talk, so you may know what it was like. I just sat in enraptured silence.
      Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin and
      diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else.
      Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could never
      be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to the stars.
      Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears. I was so
      sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn&rsquo;t see how I was
      ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if we went over
      to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me.
      That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found it true. The ice cream
      was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting
      there eating it at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night. Diana said she believed she
      was born for city life. Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was, but I
      said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her
      what I really thought. So I thought it over after I went to bed. That is
      the best time to think things out. And I came to the conclusion, Marilla,
      that I wasn&rsquo;t born for city life and that I was glad of it. It&rsquo;s nice to
      be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night
      once in a while; but as a regular thing I&rsquo;d rather be in the east gable at
      eleven, sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars
      were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the
      brook. I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed.
      Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said, even when I said the most
      solemn things. I don&rsquo;t think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn&rsquo;t trying
      to be funny. But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Friday brought going-home time, and Mr. Barry drove in for the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed yourselves,&rdquo; said Miss Barry, as she bade
      them good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we have,&rdquo; said Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Anne-girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every minute of the time,&rdquo; said Anne, throwing her arms
      impulsively about the old woman&rsquo;s neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek.
      Diana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast at
      Anne&rsquo;s freedom. But Miss Barry was pleased, and she stood on her veranda
      and watched the buggy out of sight. Then she went back into her big house
      with a sigh. It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young lives. Miss
      Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must be told, and had
      never cared much for anybody but herself. She valued people only as they
      were of service to her or amused her. Anne had amused her, and
      consequently stood high in the old lady&rsquo;s good graces. But Miss Barry
      found herself thinking less about Anne&rsquo;s quaint speeches than of her fresh
      enthusiasms, her transparent emotions, her little winning ways, and the
      sweetness of her eyes and lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she&rsquo;d adopted a
      girl out of an orphan asylum,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;but I guess she
      didn&rsquo;t make much of a mistake after all. If I&rsquo;d a child like Anne in the
      house all the time I&rsquo;d be a better and happier woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne and Diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive in&mdash;pleasanter,
      indeed, since there was the delightful consciousness of home waiting at
      the end of it. It was sunset when they passed through White Sands and
      turned into the shore road. Beyond, the Avonlea hills came out darkly
      against the saffron sky. Behind them the moon was rising out of the sea
      that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light. Every little cove
      along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples. The waves broke
      with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and the tang of the sea was in
      the strong, fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s good to be alive and to be going home,&rdquo; breathed Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of Green
      Gables winked her a friendly welcome back, and through the open door shone
      the hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn
      night. Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen, where a hot
      supper was waiting on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got back?&rdquo; said Marilla, folding up her knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and oh, it&rsquo;s so good to be back,&rdquo; said Anne joyously. &ldquo;I could kiss
      everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken! You don&rsquo;t mean
      to say you cooked that for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be hungry after such a drive
      and need something real appetizing. Hurry and take off your things, and
      we&rsquo;ll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got back, I
      must say. It&rsquo;s been fearful lonesome here without you, and I never put in
      four longer days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and
      gave them a full account of her visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a splendid time,&rdquo; she concluded happily, &ldquo;and I feel that it
      marks an epoch in my life. But the best of it all was the coming home.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXX. The Queens Class Is Organized
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA laid her
      knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair. Her eyes were tired, and
      she thought vaguely that she must see about having her glasses changed the
      next time she went to town, for her eyes had grown tired very often of
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly dark, for the full November twilight had fallen around Green
      Gables, and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames
      in the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that joyous
      glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the
      maple cordwood. She had been reading, but her book had slipped to the
      floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips.
      Glittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and
      rainbows of her lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling were
      happening to her in cloudland&mdash;adventures that always turned out
      triumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marilla looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been
      suffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling of
      fireshine and shadow. The lesson of a love that should display itself
      easily in spoken word and open look was one Marilla could never learn. But
      she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection all
      the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness. Her love made
      her afraid of being unduly indulgent, indeed. She had an uneasy feeling
      that it was rather sinful to set one&rsquo;s heart so intensely on any human
      creature as she had set hers on Anne, and perhaps she performed a sort of
      unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if
      the girl had been less dear to her. Certainly Anne herself had no idea how
      Marilla loved her. She sometimes thought wistfully that Marilla was very
      hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding. But
      she always checked the thought reproachfully, remembering what she owed to
      Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla abruptly, &ldquo;Miss Stacy was here this afternoon when
      you were out with Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne came back from her other world with a start and a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she? Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry I wasn&rsquo;t in. Why didn&rsquo;t you call me, Marilla?
      Diana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It&rsquo;s lovely in the woods
      now. All the little wood things&mdash;the ferns and the satin leaves and
      the crackerberries&mdash;have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had
      tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves. I think it was a
      little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last
      moonlight night and did it. Diana wouldn&rsquo;t say much about that, though.
      Diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about imagining
      ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on Diana&rsquo;s
      imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a blighted
      being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby said she
      guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. Ruby Gillis
      thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse she is.
      Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn&rsquo;t do to drag them
      into everything, does it? Diana and I are thinking seriously of promising
      each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live
      together forever. Diana hasn&rsquo;t quite made up her mind though, because she
      thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild, dashing, wicked
      young man and reform him. Diana and I talk a great deal about serious
      subjects now, you know. We feel that we are so much older than we used to
      be that it isn&rsquo;t becoming to talk of childish matters. It&rsquo;s such a solemn
      thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla. Miss Stacy took all us girls who are
      in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and talked to us about it.
      She said we couldn&rsquo;t be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals
      we acquired in our teens, because by the time we were twenty our
      characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future
      life. And she said if the foundation was shaky we could never build
      anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked the matter over
      coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn, Marilla. And we decided
      that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits
      and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible, so that by the time
      we were twenty our characters would be properly developed. It&rsquo;s perfectly
      appalling to think of being twenty, Marilla. It sounds so fearfully old
      and grown up. But why was Miss Stacy here this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I want to tell you, Anne, if you&rsquo;ll ever give me a chance to
      get a word in edgewise. She was talking about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me?&rdquo; Anne looked rather scared. Then she flushed and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know what she was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly I
      did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school
      yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history.
      Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour, and I had
      just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply wild to
      know how it turned out&mdash;although I felt sure Ben Hur must win,
      because it wouldn&rsquo;t be poetical justice if he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;so I spread the
      history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and
      my knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know,
      while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it
      that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I
      just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so reproachful-like.
      I can&rsquo;t tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla, especially when I heard
      Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away, but she never said a
      word then. She kept me in at recess and talked to me. She said I had done
      very wrong in two respects. First, I was wasting the time I ought to have
      put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my teacher in trying to
      make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead. I
      had never realized until that moment, Marilla, that what I was doing was
      deceitful. I was shocked. I cried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to
      forgive me and I&rsquo;d never do such a thing again; and I offered to do
      penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week, not even
      to see how the chariot race turned out. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn&rsquo;t
      require that, and she forgave me freely. So I think it wasn&rsquo;t very kind of
      her to come up here to you about it after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your
      guilty conscience that&rsquo;s the matter with you. You have no business to be
      taking storybooks to school. You read too many novels anyhow. When I was a
      girl I wasn&rsquo;t so much as allowed to look at a novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it&rsquo;s really such a religious
      book?&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a little too exciting to be proper
      reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays. And I never read <i>any</i>
      book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it is a proper book
      for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. Miss Stacy made me promise
      that. She found me reading a book one day called, The Lurid Mystery of the
      Haunted Hall. It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me, and, oh, Marilla, it was
      so fascinating and creepy. It just curdled the blood in my veins. But Miss
      Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome book, and she asked me not to
      read any more of it or any like it. I didn&rsquo;t mind promising not to read
      any more like it, but it was <i>agonizing</i> to give back that book
      without knowing how it turned out. But my love for Miss Stacy stood the
      test and I did. It&rsquo;s really wonderful, Marilla, what you can do when
      you&rsquo;re truly anxious to please a certain person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll light the lamp and get to work,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;I see
      plainly that you don&rsquo;t want to hear what Miss Stacy had to say. You&rsquo;re
      more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed, Marilla, I do want to hear it,&rdquo; cried Anne contritely. &ldquo;I
      won&rsquo;t say another word&mdash;not one. I know I talk too much, but I am
      really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you
      only knew how many things I want to say and don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;d give me some
      credit for it. Please tell me, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students
      who mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen&rsquo;s. She intends
      to give them extra lessons for an hour after school. And she came to ask
      Matthew and me if we would like to have you join it. What do you think
      about it yourself, Anne? Would you like to go to Queen&rsquo;s and pass for a
      teacher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla!&rdquo; Anne straightened to her knees and clasped her hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      been the dream of my life&mdash;that is, for the last six months, ever
      since Ruby and Jane began to talk of studying for the Entrance. But I
      didn&rsquo;t say anything about it, because I supposed it would be perfectly
      useless. I&rsquo;d love to be a teacher. But won&rsquo;t it be dreadfully expensive?
      Mr. Andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put Prissy
      through, and Prissy wasn&rsquo;t a dunce in geometry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you needn&rsquo;t worry about that part of it. When Matthew and I took
      you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give
      you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own
      living whether she ever has to or not. You&rsquo;ll always have a home at Green
      Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what is going
      to happen in this uncertain world, and it&rsquo;s just as well to be prepared.
      So you can join the Queen&rsquo;s class if you like, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, thank you.&rdquo; Anne flung her arms about Marilla&rsquo;s waist and
      looked up earnestly into her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely grateful to you and
      Matthew. And I&rsquo;ll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a
      credit to you. I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but I think I
      can hold my own in anything else if I work hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll get along well enough. Miss Stacy says you are bright
      and diligent.&rdquo; Not for worlds would Marilla have told Anne just what Miss
      Stacy had said about her; that would have been to pamper vanity. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books. There is
      no hurry. You won&rsquo;t be ready to try the Entrance for a year and a half
      yet. But it&rsquo;s well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded, Miss Stacy
      says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,&rdquo; said Anne
      blissfully, &ldquo;because I have a purpose in life. Mr. Allan says everybody
      should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. Only he says we
      must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. I would call it a worthy
      purpose to want to be a teacher like Miss Stacy, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Marilla? I
      think it&rsquo;s a very noble profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen&rsquo;s class was organized in due time. Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley,
      Ruby Gillis, Jane Andrews, Josie Pye, Charlie Sloane, and Moody Spurgeon
      MacPherson joined it. Diana Barry did not, as her parents did not intend
      to send her to Queen&rsquo;s. This seemed nothing short of a calamity to Anne.
      Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the croup, had she and
      Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when the Queen&rsquo;s class
      first remained in school for the extra lessons and Anne saw Diana go
      slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through the Birch Path and
      Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain
      from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump came into her throat, and
      she hastily retired behind the pages of her uplifted Latin grammar to hide
      the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds would Anne have had Gilbert Blythe
      or Josie Pye see those tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of
      death, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go
      out alone,&rdquo; she said mournfully that night. &ldquo;I thought how splendid it
      would have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance,
      too. But we can&rsquo;t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs.
      Lynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn&rsquo;t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but
      there&rsquo;s no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the
      Queen&rsquo;s class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just
      going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby
      says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then
      she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to
      teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for
      teaching, but a husband won&rsquo;t pay you anything, and growls if you ask for
      a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful
      experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank,
      and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she is just going to
      college for education&rsquo;s sake, because she won&rsquo;t have to earn her own
      living; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on
      charity&mdash;<i>they</i> have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to be a
      minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn&rsquo;t be anything else with a name like
      that to live up to. I hope it isn&rsquo;t wicked of me, Marilla, but really the
      thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh. He&rsquo;s such a
      funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and
      his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will be more intellectual
      looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he&rsquo;s going to go into
      politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says he&rsquo;ll never
      succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and it&rsquo;s only
      rascals that get on in politics nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Gilbert Blythe going to be?&rdquo; queried Marilla, seeing that Anne
      was opening her Caesar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t happen to know what Gilbert Blythe&rsquo;s ambition in life is&mdash;if
      he has any,&rdquo; said Anne scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was open rivalry between Gilbert and Anne now. Previously the
      rivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt that
      Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was. He was a
      foeman worthy of her steel. The other members of the class tacitly
      acknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea for
      forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry, had
      evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He
      talked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with
      them, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the
      other of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley he
      simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored.
      It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head that she did
      not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart she knew that
      she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake of Shining
      Waters again she would answer very differently. All at once, as it seemed,
      and to her secret dismay, she found that the old resentment she had
      cherished against him was gone&mdash;gone just when she most needed its
      sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every incident and
      emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying
      anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker. Anne
      realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it. But it
      was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should ever
      suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn&rsquo;t been so proud
      and horrid! She determined to &ldquo;shroud her feelings in deepest oblivion,&rdquo;
       and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so successfully that
      Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as he seemed, could not
      console himself with any belief that Anne felt his retaliatory scorn. The
      only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed Charlie Sloane,
      unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and
      studies. For Anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of
      the year. She was happy, eager, interested; there were lessons to be
      learned and honor to be won; delightful books to read; new pieces to be
      practiced for the Sunday-school choir; pleasant Saturday afternoons at the
      manse with Mrs. Allan; and then, almost before Anne realized it, spring
      had come again to Green Gables and all the world was abloom once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies palled just a wee bit then; the Queen&rsquo;s class, left behind in
      school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and
      meadow byways, looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that
      Latin verbs and French exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they
      had possessed in the crisp winter months. Even Anne and Gilbert lagged and
      grew indifferent. Teacher and taught were alike glad when the term was
      ended and the glad vacation days stretched rosily before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve done good work this past year,&rdquo; Miss Stacy told them on the
      last evening, &ldquo;and you deserve a good, jolly vacation. Have the best time
      you can in the out-of-door world and lay in a good stock of health and
      vitality and ambition to carry you through next year. It will be the tug
      of war, you know&mdash;the last year before the Entrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to be back next year, Miss Stacy?&rdquo; asked Josie Pye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josie Pye never scrupled to ask questions; in this instance the rest of
      the class felt grateful to her; none of them would have dared to ask it of
      Miss Stacy, but all wanted to, for there had been alarming rumors running
      at large through the school for some time that Miss Stacy was not coming
      back the next year&mdash;that she had been offered a position in the grade
      school of her own home district and meant to accept. The Queen&rsquo;s class
      listened in breathless suspense for her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I will,&rdquo; said Miss Stacy. &ldquo;I thought of taking another
      school, but I have decided to come back to Avonlea. To tell the truth,
      I&rsquo;ve grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I couldn&rsquo;t leave
      them. So I&rsquo;ll stay and see you through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said Moody Spurgeon. Moody Spurgeon had never been so carried
      away by his feelings before, and he blushed uncomfortably every time he
      thought about it for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; said Anne, with shining eyes. &ldquo;Dear Stacy, it would be
      perfectly dreadful if you didn&rsquo;t come back. I don&rsquo;t believe I could have
      the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Anne got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old
      trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation,&rdquo; she told
      Marilla. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I&rsquo;ve
      pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first book
      off by heart, even when the letters <i>are</i> changed. I just feel tired
      of everything sensible and I&rsquo;m going to let my imagination run riot for
      the summer. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be alarmed, Marilla. I&rsquo;ll only let it run riot
      within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time this
      summer, for maybe it&rsquo;s the last summer I&rsquo;ll be a little girl. Mrs. Lynde
      says that if I keep stretching out next year as I&rsquo;ve done this I&rsquo;ll have
      to put on longer skirts. She says I&rsquo;m all running to legs and eyes. And
      when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them
      and be very dignified. It won&rsquo;t even do to believe in fairies then, I&rsquo;m
      afraid; so I&rsquo;m going to believe in them with all my whole heart this
      summer. I think we&rsquo;re going to have a very gay vacation. Ruby Gillis is
      going to have a birthday party soon and there&rsquo;s the Sunday school picnic
      and the missionary concert next month. And Mr. Barry says that some
      evening he&rsquo;ll take Diana and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have
      dinner there. They have dinner there in the evening, you know. Jane
      Andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to
      see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such
      beautiful dresses. Jane says it was her first glimpse into high life and
      she&rsquo;ll never forget it to her dying day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why Marilla had not been
      at the Aid meeting on Thursday. When Marilla was not at Aid meeting people
      knew there was something wrong at Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew had a bad spell with his heart Thursday,&rdquo; Marilla explained, &ldquo;and
      I didn&rsquo;t feel like leaving him. Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s all right again now, but he
      takes them spells oftener than he used to and I&rsquo;m anxious about him. The
      doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement. That&rsquo;s easy enough,
      for Matthew doesn&rsquo;t go about looking for excitement by any means and never
      did, but he&rsquo;s not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well
      tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work. Come and lay off your things,
      Rachel. You&rsquo;ll stay to tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, seeing you&rsquo;re so pressing, perhaps I might as well, stay&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Rachel, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel and Marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while Anne got the
      tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even
      Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say Anne has turned out a real smart girl,&rdquo; admitted Mrs. Rachel,
      as Marilla accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset. &ldquo;She must be
      a great help to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is,&rdquo; said Marilla, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s real steady and reliable now. I used to
      be afraid she&rsquo;d never get over her featherbrained ways, but she has and I
      wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to trust her in anything now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never would have thought she&rsquo;d have turned out so well that first day I
      was here three years ago,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rachel. &ldquo;Lawful heart, shall I ever
      forget that tantrum of hers! When I went home that night I says to Thomas,
      says I, &lsquo;Mark my words, Thomas, Marilla Cuthbert &lsquo;ll live to rue the step
      she&rsquo;s took.&rsquo; But I was mistaken and I&rsquo;m real glad of it. I ain&rsquo;t one of
      those kind of people, Marilla, as can never be brought to own up that
      they&rsquo;ve made a mistake. No, that never was my way, thank goodness. I did
      make a mistake in judging Anne, but it weren&rsquo;t no wonder, for an odder,
      unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world, that&rsquo;s what.
      There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other
      children. It&rsquo;s nothing short of wonderful how she&rsquo;s improved these three
      years, but especially in looks. She&rsquo;s a real pretty girl got to be, though
      I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m overly partial to that pale, big-eyed style myself. I like
      more snap and color, like Diana Barry has or Ruby Gillis. Ruby Gillis&rsquo;s
      looks are real showy. But somehow&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how it is but when
      Anne and them are together, though she ain&rsquo;t half as handsome, she makes
      them look kind of common and overdone&mdash;something like them white June
      lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that&rsquo;s
      what.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. Where the Brook and River Meet
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE had her &ldquo;good&rdquo;
       summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly. She and Diana fairly lived outdoors,
      reveling in all the delights that Lover&rsquo;s Lane and the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble and
      Willowmere and Victoria Island afforded. Marilla offered no objections to
      Anne&rsquo;s gypsyings. The Spencervale doctor who had come the night Minnie May
      had the croup met Anne at the house of a patient one afternoon early in
      vacation, looked her over sharply, screwed up his mouth, shook his head,
      and sent a message to Marilla Cuthbert by another person. It was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and don&rsquo;t
      let her read books until she gets more spring into her step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This message frightened Marilla wholesomely. She read Anne&rsquo;s death warrant
      by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed. As a result, Anne
      had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went. She
      walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart&rsquo;s content; and when
      September came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have
      satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel just like studying with might and main,&rdquo; she declared as she
      brought her books down from the attic. &ldquo;Oh, you good old friends, I&rsquo;m glad
      to see your honest faces once more&mdash;yes, even you, geometry. I&rsquo;ve had
      a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I&rsquo;m rejoicing as a strong
      man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Allan preach
      magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every day and the
      first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we&rsquo;ll be
      left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher. But I don&rsquo;t
      see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you, Marilla? I think it would
      be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we have him. If I were a man I
      think I&rsquo;d be a minister. They can have such an influence for good, if
      their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid
      sermons and stir your hearers&rsquo; hearts. Why can&rsquo;t women be ministers,
      Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was shocked and said it would be
      a scandalous thing. She said there might be female ministers in the States
      and she believed there was, but thank goodness we hadn&rsquo;t got to that stage
      in Canada yet and she hoped we never would. But I don&rsquo;t see why. I think
      women would make splendid ministers. When there is a social to be got up
      or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to
      and do the work. I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as
      Superintendent Bell and I&rsquo;ve no doubt she could preach too with a little
      practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe she could,&rdquo; said Marilla dryly. &ldquo;She does plenty of
      unofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in
      Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne in a burst of confidence, &ldquo;I want to tell you
      something and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me terribly&mdash;on
      Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about such matters. I
      do really want to be good; and when I&rsquo;m with you or Mrs. Allan or Miss
      Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please you
      and what you would approve of. But mostly when I&rsquo;m with Mrs. Lynde I feel
      desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she
      tells me I oughtn&rsquo;t to do. I feel irresistibly tempted to do it. Now, what
      do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m
      really bad and unregenerate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very effect
      on me. I sometimes think she&rsquo;d have more of an influence for good, as you
      say yourself, if she didn&rsquo;t keep nagging people to do right. There should
      have been a special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well. There isn&rsquo;t
      a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you feel the same,&rdquo; said Anne decidedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
      encouraging. I shan&rsquo;t worry so much over that after this. But I dare say
      there&rsquo;ll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the time&mdash;things
      to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and there&rsquo;s another
      right after. There are so many things to be thought over and decided when
      you&rsquo;re beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the time thinking them
      over and deciding what is right. It&rsquo;s a serious thing to grow up, isn&rsquo;t
      it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as you and Matthew and Mrs.
      Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up successfully, and I&rsquo;m sure it will
      be my own fault if I don&rsquo;t. I feel it&rsquo;s a great responsibility because I
      have only the one chance. If I don&rsquo;t grow up right I can&rsquo;t go back and
      begin over again. I&rsquo;ve grown two inches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis
      measured me at Ruby&rsquo;s party. I&rsquo;m so glad you made my new dresses longer.
      That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the
      flounce. Of course I know it wasn&rsquo;t really necessary, but flounces are so
      stylish this fall and Josie Pye has flounces on all her dresses. I know
      I&rsquo;ll be able to study better because of mine. I shall have such a
      comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth something to have that,&rdquo; admitted Marilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stacy came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for
      work once more. Especially did the Queen&rsquo;s class gird up their loins for
      the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their pathway
      already, loomed up that fateful thing known as &ldquo;the Entrance,&rdquo; at the
      thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes.
      Suppose they did not pass! That thought was doomed to haunt Anne through
      the waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons inclusive, to the
      almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems. When Anne had
      bad dreams she found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the
      Entrance exams, where Gilbert Blythe&rsquo;s name was blazoned at the top and in
      which hers did not appear at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was as
      interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. New worlds of
      thought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored
      knowledge seemed to be opening out before Anne&rsquo;s eager eyes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Hills peeped o&rsquo;er hill and Alps on Alps arose.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Much of all this was due to Miss Stacy&rsquo;s tactful, careful, broadminded
      guidance. She led her class to think and explore and discover for
      themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree
      that quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all
      innovations on established methods rather dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from her studies Anne expanded socially, for Marilla, mindful of the
      Spencervale doctor&rsquo;s dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings. The
      Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one or two
      parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh drives and
      skating frolics galore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between times Anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that Marilla was
      astonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the girl
      was taller than herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Anne, how you&rsquo;ve grown!&rdquo; she said, almost unbelievingly. A sigh
      followed on the words. Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne&rsquo;s inches. The
      child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall,
      serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the proudly
      poised little head, in her place. Marilla loved the girl as much as she
      had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of
      loss. And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting with Diana,
      Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a
      cry. Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it and gazed at her
      in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking about Anne,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got to be such a big
      girl&mdash;and she&rsquo;ll probably be away from us next winter. I&rsquo;ll miss her
      terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be able to come home often,&rdquo; comforted Matthew, to whom Anne was
      as yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought home from
      Bright River on that June evening four years before. &ldquo;The branch railroad
      will be built to Carmody by that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the same thing as having her here all the time,&rdquo; sighed
      Marilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted.
      &ldquo;But there&mdash;men can&rsquo;t understand these things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were other changes in Anne no less real than the physical change.
      For one thing, she became much quieter. Perhaps she thought all the more
      and dreamed as much as ever, but she certainly talked less. Marilla
      noticed and commented on this also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t chatter half as much as you used to, Anne, nor use half as many
      big words. What has come over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked
      dreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on
      the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to talk as much,&rdquo; she said, denting her
      chin thoughtfully with her forefinger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nicer to think dear, pretty
      thoughts and keep them in one&rsquo;s heart, like treasures. I don&rsquo;t like to
      have them laughed at or wondered over. And somehow I don&rsquo;t want to use big
      words any more. It&rsquo;s almost a pity, isn&rsquo;t it, now that I&rsquo;m really growing
      big enough to say them if I did want to. It&rsquo;s fun to be almost grown up in
      some ways, but it&rsquo;s not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla. There&rsquo;s so
      much to learn and do and think that there isn&rsquo;t time for big words.
      Besides, Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and better. She
      makes us write all our essays as simply as possible. It was hard at first.
      I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I could think of&mdash;and
      I thought of any number of them. But I&rsquo;ve got used to it now and I see
      it&rsquo;s so much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of your story club? I haven&rsquo;t heard you speak of it for a
      long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story club isn&rsquo;t in existence any longer. We hadn&rsquo;t time for it&mdash;and
      anyhow I think we had got tired of it. It was silly to be writing about
      love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Stacy sometimes has us
      write a story for training in composition, but she won&rsquo;t let us write
      anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives, and she
      criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too. I never
      thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to look for them
      myself. I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether, but Miss Stacy
      said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own
      severest critic. And so I am trying to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only two more months before the Entrance,&rdquo; said Marilla. &ldquo;Do you
      think you&rsquo;ll be able to get through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll be all right&mdash;and then I get
      horribly afraid. We&rsquo;ve studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled us
      thoroughly, but we mayn&rsquo;t get through for all that. We&rsquo;ve each got a
      stumbling block. Mine is geometry of course, and Jane&rsquo;s is Latin, and Ruby
      and Charlie&rsquo;s is algebra, and Josie&rsquo;s is arithmetic. Moody Spurgeon says
      he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English history. Miss
      Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we&rsquo;ll have
      at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so we&rsquo;ll have some idea. I
      wish it was all over, Marilla. It haunts me. Sometimes I wake up in the
      night and wonder what I&rsquo;ll do if I don&rsquo;t pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, go to school next year and try again,&rdquo; said Marilla unconcernedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d have the heart for it. It would be such a
      disgrace to fail, especially if Gil&mdash;if the others passed. And I get
      so nervous in an examination that I&rsquo;m likely to make a mess of it. I wish
      I had nerves like Jane Andrews. Nothing rattles her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring
      world, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things
      upspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book. There
      would be other springs, but if she did not succeed in passing the
      Entrance, Anne felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently to
      enjoy them.

      CHAPTER XXXII. The Pass List Is Out
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ITH the end of
      June came the close of the term and the close of Miss Stacy&rsquo;s rule in
      Avonlea school. Anne and Diana walked home that evening feeling very sober
      indeed. Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the
      fact that Miss Stacy&rsquo;s farewell words must have been quite as touching as
      Mr. Phillips&rsquo;s had been under similar circumstances three years before.
      Diana looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and
      sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said
      dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to feel half as badly as I do,&rdquo; said Anne, hunting vainly
      for a dry spot on her handkerchief. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back again next winter, but
      I suppose I&rsquo;ve left the dear old school forever&mdash;if I have good luck,
      that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a bit the same. Miss Stacy won&rsquo;t be there, nor you nor Jane
      nor Ruby probably. I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn&rsquo;t bear to
      have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly times, haven&rsquo;t we,
      Anne? It&rsquo;s dreadful to think they&rsquo;re all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two big tears rolled down by Diana&rsquo;s nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would stop crying I could,&rdquo; said Anne imploringly. &ldquo;Just as soon
      as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off again.
      As Mrs. Lynde says, &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t be cheerful, be as cheerful as you can.&rsquo; 
      After all, I dare say I&rsquo;ll be back next year. This is one of the times I
      <i>know</i> I&rsquo;m not going to pass. They&rsquo;re getting alarmingly frequent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but those exams didn&rsquo;t make me nervous. When I think of the real
      thing you can&rsquo;t imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my
      heart. And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it&rsquo;s so unlucky.
      I am <i>not</i> superstitious and I know it can make no difference. But
      still I wish it wasn&rsquo;t thirteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish I was going in with you,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t we have a
      perfectly elegant time? But I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to cram in the
      evenings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. She says it
      would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think
      about the exams at all and go to bed early. It&rsquo;s good advice, but I expect
      it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think. Prissy
      Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her Entrance
      week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up <i>at least</i>
      as long as she did. It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to ask me to
      stay at Beechwood while I&rsquo;m in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll write to me while you&rsquo;re in, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,&rdquo; promised
      Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be haunting the post office Wednesday,&rdquo; vowed Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted the
      post office, as agreed, and got her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Diana&rdquo; [wrote Anne],
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is Tuesday night and I&rsquo;m writing this in the library at
      Beechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and
      wished so much you were with me. I couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;cram&rsquo; because I&rsquo;d promised
      Miss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as
      it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling
      for Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands
      and they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn&rsquo;t slept a
      wink and she didn&rsquo;t believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the
      teacher&rsquo;s course even if I did get through. There are times and seasons
      even yet when I don&rsquo;t feel that I&rsquo;ve made any great headway in learning to
      like Josie Pye!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all
      over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting on the
      steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth he was
      doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over
      to steady his nerves and for pity&rsquo;s sake not to interrupt him, because if
      he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever
      knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their
      proper place!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and I
      sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of the
      multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if I
      looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the
      room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination
      sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I
      picked it up. Just one awful moment&mdash;Diana, I felt exactly as I did
      four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables&mdash;and
      then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again&mdash;I
      forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!&mdash;for I knew I could do
      something with <i>that</i> paper anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the
      afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed
      up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh, Diana,
      tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every
      bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I
      thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from
      now till tomorrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody
      Spurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in
      history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was
      going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a carpenter
      than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the
      end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn&rsquo;t. Sometimes I
      have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon I&rsquo;m always
      glad I&rsquo;m a girl and not his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just
      discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When she
      recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had been
      with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as Mrs.
      Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I fail in
      geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I think I&rsquo;d
      rather it didn&rsquo;t go on if I failed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours devotedly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and Anne
      arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of chastened
      triumph about her. Diana was over at Green Gables when she arrived and
      they met as if they had been parted for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old darling, it&rsquo;s perfectly splendid to see you back again. It seems
      like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment
      that I didn&rsquo;t. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the dearest,
      loveliest spot in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did the others do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls say they know they didn&rsquo;t pass, but I think they did pretty
      well. Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!
      Moody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he
      failed in algebra. But we don&rsquo;t really know anything about it and won&rsquo;t
      until the pass list is out. That won&rsquo;t be for a fortnight. Fancy living a
      fortnight in such suspense! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up
      until it is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana knew it would be useless to ask how Gilbert Blythe had fared, so she
      merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll pass all right. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list,&rdquo;
       flashed Anne, by which she meant&mdash;and Diana knew she meant&mdash;that
      success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of
      Gilbert Blythe.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the
      examinations. So had Gilbert. They had met and passed each other on the
      street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Anne
      had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly that
      she had made friends with Gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a little
      more determinedly to surpass him in the examination. She knew that all
      Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she even knew
      that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question and that Josie
      Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert would be first;
      and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if she failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted
      to &ldquo;pass high&rdquo; for the sake of Matthew and Marilla&mdash;especially
      Matthew. Matthew had declared to her his conviction that she &ldquo;would beat
      the whole Island.&rdquo; That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to
      hope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she
      would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew&rsquo;s
      kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she felt,
      would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing
      among unimaginative equations and conjugations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the fortnight Anne took to &ldquo;haunting&rdquo; the post office also,
      in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the
      Charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings as
      bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert were
      not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,&rdquo; he
      told Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me
      suddenly whether I&rsquo;ve passed or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began to
      feel that she really couldn&rsquo;t stand the strain much longer. Her appetite
      failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished. Mrs. Lynde wanted to
      know what else you could expect with a Tory superintendent of education at
      the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting Anne&rsquo;s paleness and indifference
      and the lagging steps that bore her home from the post office every
      afternoon, began seriously to wonder if he hadn&rsquo;t better vote Grit at the
      next election.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window, for
      the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world,
      as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower
      breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of
      poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the
      reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of
      color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying down through the
      firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper
      in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The
      pass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her.
      She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana came
      rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking, so
      great was her excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, you&rsquo;ve passed,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;passed the <i>very first</i>&mdash;you
      and Gilbert both&mdash;you&rsquo;re ties&mdash;but your name is first. Oh, I&rsquo;m
      so proud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne&rsquo;s bed, utterly
      breathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,
      oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her
      shaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.
      Yes, she had passed&mdash;there was her name at the very top of a list of
      two hundred! That moment was worth living for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did just splendidly, Anne,&rdquo; puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently to
      sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a word.
      &ldquo;Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago&mdash;it
      came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won&rsquo;t be here till tomorrow
      by mail&mdash;and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild
      thing. You&rsquo;ve all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon and all,
      although he&rsquo;s conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty well&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      halfway up&mdash;and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through with three
      marks to spare, but you&rsquo;ll see she&rsquo;ll put on as many airs as if she&rsquo;d led.
      Won&rsquo;t Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel like to see
      your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were me I know I&rsquo;d
      go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but you&rsquo;re as calm and
      cool as a spring evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just dazzled inside,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I want to say a hundred things, and
      I can&rsquo;t find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this&mdash;yes, I
      did too, just once! I let myself think <i>once</i>, &lsquo;What if I should come
      out first?&rsquo; quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to
      think I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run right
      out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we&rsquo;ll go up the road and tell the
      good news to the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling hay,
      and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at the lane
      fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Matthew,&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve passed and I&rsquo;m first&mdash;or one of
      the first! I&rsquo;m not vain, but I&rsquo;m thankful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I always said it,&rdquo; said Matthew, gazing at the pass list
      delightedly. &ldquo;I knew you could beat them all easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done pretty well, I must say, Anne,&rdquo; said Marilla, trying to hide
      her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel&rsquo;s critical eye. But that good
      soul said heartily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in
      saying it. You&rsquo;re a credit to your friends, Anne, that&rsquo;s what, and we&rsquo;re
      all proud of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious
      little talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open window
      in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and
      aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it thankfulness
      for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when she slept on
      her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and beautiful as
      maidenhood might desire.

      CHAPTER XXXIII. The Hotel Concert
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>UT on your white
      organdy, by all means, Anne,&rdquo; advised Diana decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only twilight&mdash;a
      lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless sky. A big
      round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into burnished silver,
      hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet summer sounds&mdash;sleepy
      birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway voices and laughter. But in
      Anne&rsquo;s room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted, for an important
      toilet was being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that
      night four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to the
      marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept in,
      Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and dainty a
      nest as a young girl could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of Anne&rsquo;s
      early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams had kept
      pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented them. The floor
      was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that softened the high
      window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale-green art muslin.
      The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry, but with a
      dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few good pictures given
      Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy&rsquo;s photograph occupied the place of honor,
      and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh flowers on the bracket
      under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like
      the dream of a fragrance. There was no &ldquo;mahogany furniture,&rdquo; but there was
      a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a cushioned wicker rocker, a
      toilet table befrilled with white muslin, a quaint, gilt-framed mirror
      with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top,
      that used to hang in the spare room, and a low white bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had
      got it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all the
      available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along.
      Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir had been
      asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a violin solo;
      Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad; and Laura
      Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to recite.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Anne would have said at one time, it was &ldquo;an epoch in her life,&rdquo; and
      she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in the
      seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his Anne and
      Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather than admit
      it, and said she didn&rsquo;t think it was very proper for a lot of young folks
      to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother Billy
      in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and boys
      were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from town, and
      after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Do you really think the organdy will be best?&rdquo; queried Anne anxiously.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin&mdash;and it
certainly isn&rsquo;t so fashionable.&rdquo;
 
 &ldquo;But it suits you ever so much better,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so soft
and frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too
dressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Anne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for
      notable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much sought
      after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a
      dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was forever debarred;
      but she was not to take any part in the concert, so her appearance was of
      minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon Anne, who, she vowed,
      must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and combed and adorned to the
      Queen&rsquo;s taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull out that frill a little more&mdash;so; here, let me tie your sash;
      now for your slippers. I&rsquo;m going to braid your hair in two thick braids,
      and tie them halfway up with big white bows&mdash;no, don&rsquo;t pull out a
      single curl over your forehead&mdash;just have the soft part. There is no
      way you do your hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look
      like a Madonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house
      rose just behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I put my pearl beads on?&rdquo; asked Anne. &ldquo;Matthew brought me a string
      from town last week, and I know he&rsquo;d like to see them on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically, and
      finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around
      Anne&rsquo;s slim milk-white throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something so stylish about you, Anne,&rdquo; said Diana, with unenvious
      admiration. &ldquo;You hold your head with such an air. I suppose it&rsquo;s your
      figure. I am just a dumpling. I&rsquo;ve always been afraid of it, and now I
      know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have such dimples,&rdquo; said Anne, smiling affectionately into the
      pretty, vivacious face so near her own. &ldquo;Lovely dimples, like little dents
      in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream will never
      come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn&rsquo;t complain. Am I all
      ready now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt
      figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a much
      softer face. &ldquo;Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla. Doesn&rsquo;t
      she look lovely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I
      expect she&rsquo;ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with
      it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy&rsquo;s the most
      unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when he got
      it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays. Time was
      when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for Anne
      regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on
      him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable, and Matthew
      plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel,
      Anne, and put your warm jacket on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Marilla stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Anne looked,
      with that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her
      girl recite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it <i>is</i> too damp for my dress,&rdquo; said Anne anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Diana, pulling up the window blind. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      perfect night, and there won&rsquo;t be any dew. Look at the moonlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,&rdquo; said Anne, going
      over to Diana. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so splendid to see the morning coming up over those
      long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. It&rsquo;s new every
      morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest
      sunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I don&rsquo;t know how
      I&rsquo;ll get along without it when I go to town next month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of your going away tonight,&rdquo; begged Diana. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
      think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time
      this evening. What are you going to recite, Anne? And are you nervous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. I&rsquo;ve recited so often in public I don&rsquo;t mind at all now. I&rsquo;ve
      decided to give &lsquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s Vow.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s so pathetic. Laura Spencer is
      going to give a comic recitation, but I&rsquo;d rather make people cry than
      laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you recite if they encore you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t dream of encoring me,&rdquo; scoffed Anne, who was not without her
      own secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself telling
      Matthew all about it at the next morning&rsquo;s breakfast table. &ldquo;There are
      Billy and Jane now&mdash;I hear the wheels. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy Andrews insisted that Anne should ride on the front seat with him,
      so she unwillingly climbed up. She would have much preferred to sit back
      with the girls, where she could have laughed and chattered to her heart&rsquo;s
      content. There was not much of either laughter or chatter in Billy. He was
      a big, fat, stolid youth of twenty, with a round, expressionless face, and
      a painful lack of conversational gifts. But he admired Anne immensely, and
      was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to White Sands with
      that slim, upright figure beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally
      passing a sop of civility to Billy&mdash;who grinned and chuckled and
      never could think of any reply until it was too late&mdash;contrived to
      enjoy the drive in spite of all. It was a night for enjoyment. The road
      was full of buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear,
      echoed and reechoed along it. When they reached the hotel it was a blaze
      of light from top to bottom. They were met by the ladies of the concert
      committee, one of whom took Anne off to the performers&rsquo; dressing room
      which was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club, among
      whom Anne felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified. Her dress,
      which, in the east gable, had seemed so dainty and pretty, now seemed
      simple and plain&mdash;too simple and plain, she thought, among all the
      silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her. What were her pearl
      beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her? And how
      poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the
      others wore! Anne laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank miserably into
      a corner. She wished herself back in the white room at Green Gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel,
      where she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes,
      the perfume and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down in
      the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid time
      away at the back. She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and
      a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout lady
      occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Anne through her
      eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized, felt
      that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl kept talking audibly
      to her next neighbor about the &ldquo;country bumpkins&rdquo; and &ldquo;rustic belles&rdquo; in
      the audience, languidly anticipating &ldquo;such fun&rdquo; from the displays of local
      talent on the program. Anne believed that she would hate that white-lace
      girl to the end of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the
      hotel and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a
      wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems on
      her neck and in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice and
      wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her selection.
      Anne, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the time, listened
      with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended she suddenly put
      her hands over her face. She could never get up and recite after that&mdash;never.
      Had she ever thought she could recite? Oh, if she were only back at Green
      Gables!
    </p>
    <p>
      At this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Anne&mdash;who
      did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace
      girl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied
      therein if she had&mdash;got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the
      front. She was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped
      each other&rsquo;s hands in nervous sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as
      she had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience as
      this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely. Everything
      was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering&mdash;the rows of ladies in
      evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of wealth and
      culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches at the
      Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of friends and
      neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless critics. Perhaps,
      like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement from her &ldquo;rustic&rdquo;
       efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and miserable. Her knees
      trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness came over her; not a
      word could she utter, and the next moment she would have fled from the
      platform despite the humiliation which, she felt, must ever after be her
      portion if she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the audience,
      she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending forward with
      a smile on his face&mdash;a smile which seemed to Anne at once triumphant
      and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert was merely
      smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect
      produced by Anne&rsquo;s slender white form and spiritual face against a
      background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had driven over, sat
      beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting. But
      Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if she had. She drew a
      long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage and determination
      tingling over her like an electric shock. She <i>would not</i> fail before
      Gilbert Blythe&mdash;he should never be able to laugh at her, never,
      never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her recitation,
      her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without
      a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored to her, and in the
      reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she recited as she had
      never done before. When she finished there were bursts of honest applause.
      Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing with shyness and delight, found
      her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you did splendidly,&rdquo; she puffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been crying like a baby,
      actually I have. There, they&rsquo;re encoring you&mdash;they&rsquo;re bound to have
      you back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Anne confusedly. &ldquo;But yet&mdash;I must, or Matthew
      will be disappointed. He said they would encore me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t disappoint Matthew,&rdquo; said the pink lady, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint, funny
      little selection that captivated her audience still further. The rest of
      the evening was quite a little triumph for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady&mdash;who was the wife of
      an American millionaire&mdash;took her under her wing, and introduced her
      to everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional
      elocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that she
      had a charming voice and &ldquo;interpreted&rdquo; her selections beautifully. Even
      the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had supper
      in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane were invited
      to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne, but Billy was
      nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear of some such
      invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it
      was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white
      moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked into the clear sky
      beyond the dark boughs of the firs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!
      How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the
      sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants
      guarding enchanted coasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it been a perfectly splendid time?&rdquo; sighed Jane, as they drove
      away. &ldquo;I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a
      hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and
      chicken salad every blessed day. I&rsquo;m sure it would be ever so much more
      fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great, although
      I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it was better
      than Mrs. Evans&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, don&rsquo;t say things like that, Jane,&rdquo; said Anne quickly, &ldquo;because it
      sounds silly. It couldn&rsquo;t be better than Mrs. Evans&rsquo;s, you know, for she
      is a professional, and I&rsquo;m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack of
      reciting. I&rsquo;m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a compliment for you, Anne,&rdquo; said Diana. &ldquo;At least I think it must
      be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it was anyhow.
      There was an American sitting behind Jane and me&mdash;such a
      romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he is
      a distinguished artist, and that her mother&rsquo;s cousin in Boston is married
      to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard him say&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
      we, Jane?&mdash;&lsquo;Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian
      hair? She has a face I should like to paint.&rsquo; There now, Anne. But what
      does Titian hair mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;Titian was
      a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Did</i> you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?&rdquo; sighed Jane.
      &ldquo;They were simply dazzling. Wouldn&rsquo;t you just love to be rich, girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We <i>are</i> rich,&rdquo; said Anne staunchly. &ldquo;Why, we have sixteen years to
      our credit, and we&rsquo;re happy as queens, and we&rsquo;ve all got imaginations,
      more or less. Look at that sea, girls&mdash;all silver and shadow and
      vision of things not seen. We couldn&rsquo;t enjoy its loveliness any more if we
      had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn&rsquo;t change into
      any of those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl
      and wear a sour look all your life, as if you&rsquo;d been born turning up your
      nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so stout and
      short that you&rsquo;d really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans, with that
      sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime
      to have such a look. You <i>know</i> you wouldn&rsquo;t, Jane Andrews!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; said Jane unconvinced. &ldquo;I think
      diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by
      diamonds all my life,&rdquo; declared Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite content to be Anne of
      Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know Matthew gave me as
      much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady&rsquo;s jewels.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXIV. A Queen&rsquo;s Girl
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next three
      weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was getting ready to go to
      Queen&rsquo;s, and there was much sewing to be done, and many things to be
      talked over and arranged. Anne&rsquo;s outfit was ample and pretty, for Matthew
      saw to that, and Marilla for once made no objections whatever to anything
      he purchased or suggested. More&mdash;one evening she went up to the east
      gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, here&rsquo;s something for a nice light dress for you. I don&rsquo;t suppose
      you really need it; you&rsquo;ve plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe
      you&rsquo;d like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of
      an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that Jane and
      Ruby and Josie have got &lsquo;evening dresses,&rsquo; as they call them, and I don&rsquo;t
      mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me pick it in town
      last week, and we&rsquo;ll get Emily Gillis to make it for you. Emily has got
      taste, and her fits aren&rsquo;t to be equaled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, it&rsquo;s just lovely,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Thank you so much. I don&rsquo;t
      believe you ought to be so kind to me&mdash;it&rsquo;s making it harder every
      day for me to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as
      Emily&rsquo;s taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew&rsquo;s and
      Marilla&rsquo;s benefit, and recited &ldquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s Vow&rdquo; for them in the kitchen.
      As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful motions her
      thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green Gables, and
      memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child in her
      preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking out of
      her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to Marilla&rsquo;s own
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,&rdquo; said Anne gaily
      stooping over Marilla&rsquo;s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady&rsquo;s
      cheek. &ldquo;Now, I call that a positive triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t crying over your piece,&rdquo; said Marilla, who would have
      scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. &ldquo;I just
      couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And I was
      wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your queer
      ways. You&rsquo;ve grown up now and you&rsquo;re going away; and you look so tall and
      stylish and so&mdash;so&mdash;different altogether in that dress&mdash;as
      if you didn&rsquo;t belong in Avonlea at all&mdash;and I just got lonesome
      thinking it all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla!&rdquo; Anne sat down on Marilla&rsquo;s gingham lap, took Marilla&rsquo;s lined
      face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla&rsquo;s
      eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit changed&mdash;not really. I&rsquo;m only just pruned down
      and branched out. The real <i>me</i>&mdash;back here&mdash;is just the
      same. It won&rsquo;t make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change
      outwardly; at heart I shall always be your little Anne, who will love you
      and Matthew and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla&rsquo;s faded one, and reached
      out a hand to pat Matthew&rsquo;s shoulder. Marilla would have given much just
      then to have possessed Anne&rsquo;s power of putting her feelings into words;
      but nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her
      arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing that
      she need never let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went
      out-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked
      agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I guess she ain&rsquo;t been much spoiled,&rdquo; he muttered, proudly. &ldquo;I
      guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all. She&rsquo;s
      smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the rest.
      She&rsquo;s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake than
      what Mrs. Spencer made&mdash;if it <i>was</i> luck. I don&rsquo;t believe it was
      any such thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her,
      I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day finally came when Anne must go to town. She and Matthew drove in
      one fine September morning, after a tearful parting with Diana and an
      untearful practical one&mdash;on Marilla&rsquo;s side at least&mdash;with
      Marilla. But when Anne had gone Diana dried her tears and went to a beach
      picnic at White Sands with some of her Carmody cousins, where she
      contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well; while Marilla plunged fiercely
      into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind
      of heartache&mdash;the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself
      away in ready tears. But that night, when Marilla went to bed, acutely and
      miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was
      untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing,
      she buried her face in her pillow, and wept for her girl in a passion of
      sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect how very
      wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to
      hurry off to the Academy. That first day passed pleasantly enough in a
      whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the
      professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne
      intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss
      Stacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a First
      Class teacher&rsquo;s license in one year instead of two, if they were
      successful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby,
      Josie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the stirrings
      of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work. Anne was
      conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with
      fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the tall,
      brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion she did,
      did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically. Yet she was
      undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old rivalry could
      still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what to do if it had
      been lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t feel comfortable without it,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Gilbert looks
      awfully determined. I suppose he&rsquo;s making up his mind, here and now, to
      win the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never noticed it before. I
      do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I suppose I won&rsquo;t
      feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted, though.
      I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends. It&rsquo;s really
      an interesting speculation. Of course I promised Diana that no Queen&rsquo;s
      girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear to me as she
      is; but I&rsquo;ve lots of second-best affections to bestow. I like the look of
      that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist. She looks vivid and
      red-rosy; there&rsquo;s that pale, fair one gazing out of the window. She has
      lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two about dreams. I&rsquo;d
      like to know them both&mdash;know them well&mdash;well enough to walk with
      my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. But just now I don&rsquo;t
      know them and they don&rsquo;t know me, and probably don&rsquo;t want to know me
      particularly. Oh, it&rsquo;s lonesome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was lonesomer still when Anne found herself alone in her hall bedroom
      that night at twilight. She was not to board with the other girls, who all
      had relatives in town to take pity on them. Miss Josephine Barry would
      have liked to board her, but Beechwood was so far from the Academy that it
      was out of the question; so Miss Barry hunted up a boarding-house,
      assuring Matthew and Marilla that it was the very place for Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,&rdquo; explained Miss Barry.
      &ldquo;Her husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what sort of
      boarders she takes. Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons
      under her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in a
      quiet neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did not
      materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon
      her. She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its
      dull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty
      book-case; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of her
      own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant
      consciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in
      the garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the
      slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a vast
      starry sky, and the light from Diana&rsquo;s window shining out through the gap
      in the trees. Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that outside of
      her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone wires shutting
      out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand lights gleaming on
      stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry, and fought against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> cry. It&rsquo;s silly&mdash;and weak&mdash;there&rsquo;s the third
      tear splashing down by my nose. There are more coming! I must think of
      something funny to stop them. But there&rsquo;s nothing funny except what is
      connected with Avonlea, and that only makes things worse&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      going home next Friday, but that seems a hundred years away. Oh, Matthew
      is nearly home by now&mdash;and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the
      lane for him&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;oh, there&rsquo;s no use in
      counting them! They&rsquo;re coming in a flood presently. I can&rsquo;t cheer up&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to cheer up. It&rsquo;s nicer to be miserable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not Josie Pye appeared
      at that moment. In the joy of seeing a familiar face Anne forgot that
      there had never been much love lost between her and Josie. As a part of
      Avonlea life even a Pye was welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came up,&rdquo; Anne said sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been crying,&rdquo; remarked Josie, with aggravating pity. &ldquo;I suppose
      you&rsquo;re homesick&mdash;some people have so little self-control in that
      respect. I&rsquo;ve no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town&rsquo;s too
      jolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so
      long. You shouldn&rsquo;t cry, Anne; it isn&rsquo;t becoming, for your nose and eyes
      get red, and then you seem <i>all</i> red. I&rsquo;d a perfectly scrumptious
      time in the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His
      moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything
      eatable around, Anne? I&rsquo;m literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla
      &lsquo;d load you up with cake. That&rsquo;s why I called round. Otherwise I&rsquo;d have
      gone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards same
      place as I do, and he&rsquo;s a sport. He noticed you in class today, and asked
      me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that the
      Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you&rsquo;d been
      before that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more
      satisfactory than Josie Pye&rsquo;s companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared,
      each with an inch of Queen&rsquo;s color ribbon&mdash;purple and scarlet&mdash;pinned
      proudly to her coat. As Josie was not &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; to Jane just then she had
      to subside into comparative harmlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jane with a sigh, &ldquo;I feel as if I&rsquo;d lived many moons since
      the morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil&mdash;that horrid old
      professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply
      couldn&rsquo;t settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the traces of
      tears. If you&rsquo;ve been crying <i>do</i> own up. It will restore my
      self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I
      don&rsquo;t mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake?
      You&rsquo;ll give me a teeny piece, won&rsquo;t you? Thank you. It has the real
      Avonlea flavor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruby, perceiving the Queen&rsquo;s calendar lying on the table, wanted to know
      if Anne meant to try for the gold medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that reminds me,&rdquo; said Josie, &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s is to get one of the Avery
      scholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me&mdash;his
      uncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced in
      the Academy tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An Avery scholarship! Anne felt her heart beat more quickly, and the
      horizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic. Before
      Josie had told the news Anne&rsquo;s highest pinnacle of aspiration had been a
      teacher&rsquo;s provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and
      perhaps the medal! But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning the
      Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and
      graduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie&rsquo;s words
      had died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt
      that here her foot was on native heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his
      fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among
      the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,
      according to their respective standings. There had been much doubt whether
      one would be allotted to Queen&rsquo;s, but the matter was settled at last, and
      at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark in English
      and English Literature would win the scholarship&mdash;two hundred and
      fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder that
      Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,&rdquo; she resolved.
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it&rsquo;s delightful to
      have ambitions. I&rsquo;m so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to be
      any end to them&mdash;that&rsquo;s the best of it. Just as soon as you attain to
      one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does make
      life so interesting.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXV. The Winter at Queen&rsquo;s
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE&rsquo;S homesickness
      wore off, greatly helped in the wearing by her weekend visits home. As
      long as the open weather lasted the Avonlea students went out to Carmody
      on the new branch railway every Friday night. Diana and several other
      Avonlea young folks were generally on hand to meet them and they all
      walked over to Avonlea in a merry party. Anne thought those Friday evening
      gypsyings over the autumnal hills in the crisp golden air, with the
      homelights of Avonlea twinkling beyond, were the best and dearest hours in
      the whole week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Blythe nearly always walked with Ruby Gillis and carried her
      satchel for her. Ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking herself
      quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long as her
      mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had to take
      it down when she went home. She had large, bright-blue eyes, a brilliant
      complexion, and a plump showy figure. She laughed a great deal, was
      cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of life
      frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would like,&rdquo;
       whispered Jane to Anne. Anne did not think so either, but she would not
      have said so for the Avery scholarship. She could not help thinking, too,
      that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert to jest
      and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and ambitions.
      Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem the sort of
      person with whom such could be profitably discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no silly sentiment in Anne&rsquo;s ideas concerning Gilbert. Boys were
      to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good comrades.
      If she and Gilbert had been friends she would not have cared how many
      other friends he had nor with whom he walked. She had a genius for
      friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague
      consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing to
      round out one&rsquo;s conceptions of companionship and furnish broader
      standpoints of judgment and comparison. Not that Anne could have put her
      feelings on the matter into just such clear definition. But she thought
      that if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the
      crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and
      merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening
      around them and their hopes and ambitions therein. Gilbert was a clever
      young fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to
      get the best out of life and put the best into it. Ruby Gillis told Jane
      Andrews that she didn&rsquo;t understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said; he
      talked just like Anne Shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on and for
      her part she didn&rsquo;t think it any fun to be bothering about books and that
      sort of thing when you didn&rsquo;t have to. Frank Stockley had lots more dash
      and go, but then he wasn&rsquo;t half as good-looking as Gilbert and she really
      couldn&rsquo;t decide which she liked best!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Academy Anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about her,
      thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself. With the
      &ldquo;rose-red&rdquo; girl, Stella Maynard, and the &ldquo;dream girl,&rdquo; Priscilla Grant,
      she soon became intimate, finding the latter pale spiritual-looking maiden
      to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun, while the vivid,
      black-eyed Stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies, as aerial
      and rainbow-like as Anne&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Christmas holidays the Avonlea students gave up going home on
      Fridays and settled down to hard work. By this time all the Queen&rsquo;s
      scholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and the various
      classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of individuality.
      Certain facts had become generally accepted. It was admitted that the
      medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three&mdash;Gilbert
      Blythe, Anne Shirley, and Lewis Wilson; the Avery scholarship was more
      doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible winner. The bronze
      medal for mathematics was considered as good as won by a fat, funny little
      up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a patched coat.

      Ruby Gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the Academy; in the
      Second Year classes Stella Maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with
      small but critical minority in favor of Anne Shirley. Ethel Marr was
      admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes of
      hair-dressing, and Jane Andrews&mdash;plain, plodding, conscientious Jane&mdash;carried
      off the honors in the domestic science course. Even Josie Pye attained a
      certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in attendance at
      Queen&rsquo;s. So it may be fairly stated that Miss Stacy&rsquo;s old pupils held
      their own in the wider arena of the academical course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne worked hard and steadily. Her rivalry with Gilbert was as intense as
      it had ever been in Avonlea school, although it was not known in the class
      at large, but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it. Anne no longer
      wished to win for the sake of defeating Gilbert; rather, for the proud
      consciousness of a well-won victory over a worthy foeman. It would be
      worth while to win, but she no longer thought life would be insupportable
      if she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times.
      Anne spent many of her spare hours at Beechwood and generally ate her
      Sunday dinners there and went to church with Miss Barry. The latter was,
      as she admitted, growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the
      vigor of her tongue in the least abated. But she never sharpened the
      latter on Anne, who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Anne-girl improves all the time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I get tired of other
      girls&mdash;there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them.
      Anne has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest
      while it lasts. I don&rsquo;t know that she is as amusing as she was when she
      was a child, but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love
      them. It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, almost before anybody realized it, spring had come; out in Avonlea
      the Mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where
      snow-wreaths lingered; and the &ldquo;mist of green&rdquo; was on the woods and in the
      valleys. But in Charlottetown harassed Queen&rsquo;s students thought and talked
      only of examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that the term is nearly over,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Why,
      last fall it seemed so long to look forward to&mdash;a whole winter of
      studies and classes. And here we are, with the exams looming up next week.
      Girls, sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything, but when I
      look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue
      air at the end of the streets they don&rsquo;t seem half so important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Ruby and Josie, who had dropped in, did not take this view of it.
      To them the coming examinations were constantly very important indeed&mdash;far
      more important than chestnut buds or Maytime hazes. It was all very well
      for Anne, who was sure of passing at least, to have her moments of
      belittling them, but when your whole future depended on them&mdash;as the
      girls truly thought theirs did&mdash;you could not regard them
      philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost seven pounds in the last two weeks,&rdquo; sighed Jane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use
      to say don&rsquo;t worry. I <i>will</i> worry. Worrying helps you some&mdash;it
      seems as if you were doing something when you&rsquo;re worrying. It would be
      dreadful if I failed to get my license after going to Queen&rsquo;s all winter
      and spending so much money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Josie Pye. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t pass this year I&rsquo;m
      coming back next. My father can afford to send me. Anne, Frank Stockley
      says that Professor Tremaine said Gilbert Blythe was sure to get the medal
      and that Emily Clay would likely win the Avery scholarship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may make me feel badly tomorrow, Josie,&rdquo; laughed Anne, &ldquo;but just now
      I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are coming out all
      purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns are
      poking their heads up in Lovers&rsquo; Lane, it&rsquo;s not a great deal of difference
      whether I win the Avery or not. I&rsquo;ve done my best and I begin to
      understand what is meant by the &lsquo;joy of the strife.&rsquo; Next to trying and
      winning, the best thing is trying and failing. Girls, don&rsquo;t talk about
      exams! Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture
      to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark beech-woods back
      of Avonlea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to wear for commencement, Jane?&rdquo; asked Ruby
      practically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Josie both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side
      eddy of fashions. But Anne, with her elbows on the window sill, her soft
      cheek laid against her clasped hands, and her eyes filled with visions,
      looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of
      sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue
      of youth&rsquo;s own optimism. All the Beyond was hers with its possibilities
      lurking rosily in the oncoming years&mdash;each year a rose of promise to
      be woven into an immortal chaplet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. The Glory and the Dream
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the morning when
      the final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the
      bulletin board at Queen&rsquo;s, Anne and Jane walked down the street together.
      Jane was smiling and happy; examinations were over and she was comfortably
      sure she had made a pass at least; further considerations troubled Jane
      not at all; she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected
      with the unrest attendant thereon. For we pay a price for everything we
      get or take in this world; and although ambitions are well worth having,
      they are not to be cheaply won, but exact their dues of work and
      self-denial, anxiety and discouragement. Anne was pale and quiet; in ten
      more minutes she would know who had won the medal and who the Avery.
      Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything
      worth being called Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll win one of them anyhow,&rdquo; said Jane, who couldn&rsquo;t
      understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not hope of the Avery,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Everybody says Emily Clay will
      win it. And I&rsquo;m not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at
      it before everybody. I haven&rsquo;t the moral courage. I&rsquo;m going straight to
      the girls&rsquo; dressing room. You must read the announcements and then come
      and tell me, Jane. And I implore you in the name of our old friendship to
      do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just say so, without trying
      to break it gently; and whatever you do <i>don&rsquo;t</i> sympathize with me.
      Promise me this, Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for
      such a promise. When they went up the entrance steps of Queen&rsquo;s they found
      the hall full of boys who were carrying Gilbert Blythe around on their
      shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices, &ldquo;Hurrah for Blythe,
      Medalist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment. So
      she had failed and Gilbert had won! Well, Matthew would be sorry&mdash;he
      had been so sure she would win.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then!
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for Miss Shirley, winner of the Avery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anne,&rdquo; gasped Jane, as they fled to the girls&rsquo; dressing room amid
      hearty cheers. &ldquo;Oh, Anne I&rsquo;m so proud! Isn&rsquo;t it splendid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the girls were around them and Anne was the center of a laughing,
      congratulating group. Her shoulders were thumped and her hands shaken
      vigorously. She was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all she
      managed to whisper to Jane:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t Matthew and Marilla be pleased! I must write the news home
      right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commencement was the next important happening. The exercises were held in
      the big assembly hall of the Academy. Addresses were given, essays read,
      songs sung, the public award of diplomas, prizes and medals made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew and Marilla were there, with eyes and ears for only one student on
      the platform&mdash;a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed cheeks
      and starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and whispered
      about as the Avery winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;re glad we kept her, Marilla?&rdquo; whispered Matthew, speaking for
      the first time since he had entered the hall, when Anne had finished her
      essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve been glad,&rdquo; retorted Marilla. &ldquo;You do like
      to rub things in, Matthew Cuthbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked Marilla
      in the back with her parasol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you proud of that Anne-girl? I am,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne went home to Avonlea with Matthew and Marilla that evening. She had
      not been home since April and she felt that she could not wait another
      day. The apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young. Diana
      was at Green Gables to meet her. In her own white room, where Marilla had
      set a flowering house rose on the window sill, Anne looked about her and
      drew a long breath of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Diana, it&rsquo;s so good to be back again. It&rsquo;s so good to see those
      pointed firs coming out against the pink sky&mdash;and that white orchard
      and the old Snow Queen. Isn&rsquo;t the breath of the mint delicious? And that
      tea rose&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s a song and a hope and a prayer all in one. And
      it&rsquo;s <i>good</i> to see you again, Diana!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me,&rdquo; said Diana
      reproachfully. &ldquo;Josie Pye told me you did. Josie said you were <i>infatuated</i>
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne laughed and pelted Diana with the faded &ldquo;June lilies&rdquo; of her bouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are
      that one, Diana,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I love you more than ever&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve so
      many things to tell you. But just now I feel as if it were joy enough to
      sit here and look at you. I&rsquo;m tired, I think&mdash;tired of being studious
      and ambitious. I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in
      the orchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done splendidly, Anne. I suppose you won&rsquo;t be teaching now that
      you&rsquo;ve won the Avery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to Redmond in September. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem wonderful? I&rsquo;ll
      have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three
      glorious, golden months of vacation. Jane and Ruby are going to teach.
      Isn&rsquo;t it splendid to think we all got through even to Moody Spurgeon and
      Josie Pye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already,&rdquo; said
      Diana. &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe is going to teach, too. He has to. His father can&rsquo;t
      afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means to earn
      his own way through. I expect he&rsquo;ll get the school here if Miss Ames
      decides to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise. She had not known
      this; she had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond also. What
      would she do without their inspiring rivalry? Would not work, even at a
      coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be rather flat
      without her friend the enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck Anne that Matthew was not
      looking well. Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly when he had gone out, &ldquo;is Matthew quite
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Marilla in a troubled tone. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had some real bad
      spells with his heart this spring and he won&rsquo;t spare himself a mite. I&rsquo;ve
      been real worried about him, but he&rsquo;s some better this while back and
      we&rsquo;ve got a good hired man, so I&rsquo;m hoping he&rsquo;ll kind of rest and pick up.
      Maybe he will now you&rsquo;re home. You always cheer him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne leaned across the table and took Marilla&rsquo;s face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not looking as well yourself as I&rsquo;d like to see you, Marilla. You
      look tired. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve been working too hard. You must take a rest,
      now that I&rsquo;m home. I&rsquo;m just going to take this one day off to visit all
      the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will be your
      turn to be lazy while I do the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla smiled affectionately at her girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the work&mdash;it&rsquo;s my head. I&rsquo;ve got a pain so often now&mdash;behind
      my eyes. Doctor Spencer&rsquo;s been fussing with glasses, but they don&rsquo;t do me
      any good. There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the last
      of June and the doctor says I must see him. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to. I can&rsquo;t
      read or sew with any comfort now. Well, Anne, you&rsquo;ve done real well at
      Queen&rsquo;s I must say. To take First Class License in one year and win the
      Avery scholarship&mdash;well, well, Mrs. Lynde says pride goes before a
      fall and she doesn&rsquo;t believe in the higher education of women at all; she
      says it unfits them for woman&rsquo;s true sphere. I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.
      Speaking of Rachel reminds me&mdash;did you hear anything about the Abbey
      Bank lately, Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it was shaky,&rdquo; answered Anne. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Rachel said. She was up here one day last week and said
      there was some talk about it. Matthew felt real worried. All we have saved
      is in that bank&mdash;every penny. I wanted Matthew to put it in the
      Savings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of
      father&rsquo;s and he&rsquo;d always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him
      at the head of it was good enough for anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he has only been its nominal head for many years,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;He
      is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the institution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money right
      out and he said he&rsquo;d think of it. But Mr. Russell told him yesterday that
      the bank was all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world. She never
      forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free from shadow
      and so lavish of blossom. Anne spent some of its rich hours in the
      orchard; she went to the Dryad&rsquo;s Bubble and Willowmere and Violet Vale;
      she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan; and
      finally in the evening she went with Matthew for the cows, through Lovers&rsquo; 
      Lane to the back pasture. The woods were all gloried through with sunset
      and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill gaps in the
      west. Matthew walked slowly with bent head; Anne, tall and erect, suited
      her springing step to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working too hard today, Matthew,&rdquo; she said reproachfully.
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you take things easier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I can&rsquo;t seem to,&rdquo; said Matthew, as he opened the yard gate to
      let the cows through. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that I&rsquo;m getting old, Anne, and keep
      forgetting it. Well, well, I&rsquo;ve always worked pretty hard and I&rsquo;d rather
      drop in harness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had been the boy you sent for,&rdquo; said Anne wistfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be able to
      help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways. I could find it in
      my heart to wish I had been, just for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I&rsquo;d rather have you than a dozen boys, Anne,&rdquo; said Matthew
      patting her hand. &ldquo;Just mind you that&mdash;rather than a dozen boys. Well
      now, I guess it wasn&rsquo;t a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it? It
      was a girl&mdash;my girl&mdash;my girl that I&rsquo;m proud of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard. Anne took the
      memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a
      long while at her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the
      future. Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine; the
      frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope. Anne always
      remembered the silvery, peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night.
      It was the last night before sorrow touched her life; and no life is ever
      quite the same again when once that cold, sanctifying touch has been laid
      upon it.

      CHAPTER XXXVII. The Reaper Whose Name Is Death
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ATTHEW&mdash;Matthew&mdash;what
      is the matter? Matthew, are you sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word. Anne came through the
      hall, her hands full of white narcissus,&mdash;it was long before Anne
      could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,&mdash;in time to
      hear her and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper
      in his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray. Anne dropped her
      flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as
      Marilla. They were both too late; before they could reach him Matthew had
      fallen across the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fainted,&rdquo; gasped Marilla. &ldquo;Anne, run for Martin&mdash;quick, quick!
      He&rsquo;s at the barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office,
      started at once for the doctor, calling at Orchard Slope on his way to
      send Mr. and Mrs. Barry over. Mrs. Lynde, who was there on an errand, came
      too. They found Anne and Marilla distractedly trying to restore Matthew to
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his pulse, and then laid her
      ear over his heart. She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and the
      tears came into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;we can do anything
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lynde, you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;you can&rsquo;t think Matthew is&mdash;is&mdash;&rdquo;
       Anne could not say the dreadful word; she turned sick and pallid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, yes, I&rsquo;m afraid of it. Look at his face. When you&rsquo;ve seen that
      look as often as I have you&rsquo;ll know what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great
      Presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and
      probably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock. The
      secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper Matthew had held and
      which Martin had brought from the office that morning. It contained an
      account of the failure of the Abbey Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news spread quickly through Avonlea, and all day friends and neighbors
      thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness for the
      dead and living. For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert was a
      person of central importance; the white majesty of death had fallen on him
      and set him apart as one crowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was
      hushed and tranquil. In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin, his
      long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly
      smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. There were flowers
      about him&mdash;sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had planted
      in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which Matthew had
      always had a secret, wordless love. Anne had gathered them and brought
      them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white face. It
      was the last thing she could do for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to the
      east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Diana.&rdquo; Anne looked earnestly into her friend&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I think
      you won&rsquo;t misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I&rsquo;m not afraid.
      I haven&rsquo;t been alone one minute since it happened&mdash;and I want to be.
      I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can&rsquo;t realize
      it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can&rsquo;t be dead; and the other
      half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and I&rsquo;ve had
      this horrible dull ache ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana did not quite understand. Marilla&rsquo;s impassioned grief, breaking all
      the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush, she
      could comprehend better than Anne&rsquo;s tearless agony. But she went away
      kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne hoped that the tears would come in solitude. It seemed to her a
      terrible thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had
      loved so much and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked with
      her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below with
      that awful peace on his brow. But no tears came at first, even when she
      knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the stars
      beyond the hills&mdash;no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of
      misery that kept on aching until she fell asleep, worn out with the day&rsquo;s
      pain and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night she awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about her,
      and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of sorrow. She
      could see Matthew&rsquo;s face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted
      at the gate that last evening&mdash;she could hear his voice saying, &ldquo;My
      girl&mdash;my girl that I&rsquo;m proud of.&rdquo; Then the tears came and Anne wept
      her heart out. Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;there&mdash;don&rsquo;t cry so, dearie. It can&rsquo;t bring him back. It&mdash;it&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it then. He&rsquo;d
      always been such a good, kind brother to me&mdash;but God knows best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just let me cry, Marilla,&rdquo; sobbed Anne. &ldquo;The tears don&rsquo;t hurt me like
      that ache did. Stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm
      round me&mdash;so. I couldn&rsquo;t have Diana stay, she&rsquo;s good and kind and
      sweet&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not her sorrow&mdash;she&rsquo;s outside of it and she
      couldn&rsquo;t come close enough to my heart to help me. It&rsquo;s our sorrow&mdash;yours
      and mine. Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got each other, Anne. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do if you weren&rsquo;t here&mdash;if
      you&rsquo;d never come. Oh, Anne, I know I&rsquo;ve been kind of strict and harsh with
      you maybe&mdash;but you mustn&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t love you as well as Matthew
      did, for all that. I want to tell you now when I can. It&rsquo;s never been easy
      for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this it&rsquo;s easier.
      I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you&rsquo;ve been
      my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead
      threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had
      loved and the trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its
      usual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old
      groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before,
      although always with the aching sense of &ldquo;loss in all familiar things.&rdquo;
       Anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so&mdash;that
      they <i>could</i> go on in the old way without Matthew. She felt something
      like shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the
      firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush
      of gladness when she saw them&mdash;that Diana&rsquo;s visits were pleasant to
      her and that Diana&rsquo;s merry words and ways moved her to laughter and smiles&mdash;that,
      in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost
      none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her heart, that life
      still called to her with many insistent voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in these
      things now that he has gone,&rdquo; she said wistfully to Mrs. Allan one evening
      when they were together in the manse garden. &ldquo;I miss him so much&mdash;all
      the time&mdash;and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very beautiful
      and interesting to me for all. Today Diana said something funny and I
      found myself laughing. I thought when it happened I could never laugh
      again. And it somehow seems as if I oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know
      that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Allan gently. &ldquo;He is just away now; and he likes to know it just the same.
      I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences
      that nature offers us. But I can understand your feeling. I think we all
      experience the same thing. We resent the thought that anything can please
      us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us,
      and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our
      interest in life returning to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew&rsquo;s grave this
      afternoon,&rdquo; said Anne dreamily. &ldquo;I took a slip of the little white Scotch
      rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago; Matthew always
      liked those roses the best&mdash;they were so small and sweet on their
      thorny stems. It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his grave&mdash;as
      if I were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be
      near him. I hope he has roses like them in heaven. Perhaps the souls of
      all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all
      there to meet him. I must go home now. Marilla is all alone and she gets
      lonely at twilight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be lonelier still, I fear, when you go away again to college,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Allan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to green
      Gables. Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down
      beside her. The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch
      shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in her
      hair. She liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial
      benediction, above her every time she moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Spencer was here while you were away,&rdquo; Marilla said. &ldquo;He says that
      the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must go in
      and have my eyes examined. I suppose I&rsquo;d better go and have it over. I&rsquo;ll
      be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind of glasses to
      suit my eyes. You won&rsquo;t mind staying here alone while I&rsquo;m away, will you?
      Martin will have to drive me in and there&rsquo;s ironing and baking to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be all right. Diana will come over for company for me. I shall
      attend to the ironing and baking beautifully&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t fear that
      I&rsquo;ll starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne. You were
      always getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do you
      mind the time you dyed your hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it,&rdquo; smiled Anne, touching the heavy
      braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. &ldquo;I laugh a little now
      sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me&mdash;but I
      don&rsquo;t laugh <i>much</i>, because it was a very real trouble then. I did
      suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles are really gone;
      and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now&mdash;all but
      Josie Pye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder
      than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked
      me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I&rsquo;ve
      almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I&rsquo;ve made what I would
      once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won&rsquo;t <i>be</i>
      liked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josie is a Pye,&rdquo; said Marilla sharply, &ldquo;so she can&rsquo;t help being
      disagreeable. I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in
      society, but I must say I don&rsquo;t know what it is any more than I know the
      use of thistles. Is Josie going to teach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is going back to Queen&rsquo;s next year. So are Moody Spurgeon and
      Charlie Sloane. Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got
      schools&mdash;Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a nice-looking fellow he is,&rdquo; said Marilla absently. &ldquo;I saw him in
      church last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot like
      his father did at the same age. John Blythe was a nice boy. We used to be
      real good friends, he and I. People called him my beau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked up with swift interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marilla&mdash;and what happened?&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had a quarrel. I wouldn&rsquo;t forgive him when he asked me to. I meant to,
      after awhile&mdash;but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him
      first. He never came back&mdash;the Blythes were all mighty independent.
      But I always felt&mdash;rather sorry. I&rsquo;ve always kind of wished I&rsquo;d
      forgiven him when I had the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve had a bit of romance in your life, too,&rdquo; said Anne softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn&rsquo;t think so to look at
      me, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides.
      Everybody has forgot about me and John. I&rsquo;d forgotten myself. But it all
      came back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. The Bend in the road
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA went to
      town the next day and returned in the evening. Anne had gone over to
      Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in the kitchen,
      sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand. Something in her
      dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne&rsquo;s heart. She had never seen
      Marilla sit limply inert like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you very tired, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Marilla wearily, looking up. &ldquo;I
      suppose I am tired but I haven&rsquo;t thought about it. It&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the oculist? What did he say?&rdquo; asked Anne anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all
      reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,
      and if I&rsquo;m careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he&rsquo;s given me he
      thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured. But
      if I don&rsquo;t he says I&rsquo;ll certainly be stone-blind in six months. Blind!
      Anne, just think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was
      silent. It seemed to her that she could <i>not</i> speak. Then she said
      bravely, but with a catch in her voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you
      are careful you won&rsquo;t lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure
      your headaches it will be a great thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it much hope,&rdquo; said Marilla bitterly. &ldquo;What am I to live for
      if I can&rsquo;t read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well be blind&mdash;or
      dead. And as for crying, I can&rsquo;t help that when I get lonesome. But there,
      it&rsquo;s no good talking about it. If you&rsquo;ll get me a cup of tea I&rsquo;ll be
      thankful. I&rsquo;m about done out. Don&rsquo;t say anything about this to any one for
      a spell yet, anyway. I can&rsquo;t bear that folks should come here to question
      and sympathize and talk about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then
      Anne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the
      darkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly things
      had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home! Then she
      had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise.
      Anne felt as if she had lived years since then, but before she went to bed
      there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart. She had looked her
      duty courageously in the face and found it a friend&mdash;as duty ever is
      when we meet it frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front yard
      where she had been talking to a caller&mdash;a man whom Anne knew by sight
      as Sadler from Carmody. Anne wondered what he could have been saying to
      bring that look to Marilla&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in her
      eyes in defiance of the oculist&rsquo;s prohibition and her voice broke as she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy it! Buy Green Gables?&rdquo; Anne wondered if she had heard aright. &ldquo;Oh,
      Marilla, you don&rsquo;t mean to sell Green Gables!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, I don&rsquo;t know what else is to be done. I&rsquo;ve thought it all over. If
      my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after things
      and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can&rsquo;t. I may lose my
      sight altogether; and anyway I&rsquo;ll not be fit to run things. Oh, I never
      thought I&rsquo;d live to see the day when I&rsquo;d have to sell my home. But things
      would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till nobody would want
      to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank; and there&rsquo;s some
      notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises me to sell the
      farm and board somewhere&mdash;with her I suppose. It won&rsquo;t bring much&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      small and the buildings are old. But it&rsquo;ll be enough for me to live on I
      reckon. I&rsquo;m thankful you&rsquo;re provided for with that scholarship, Anne. I&rsquo;m
      sorry you won&rsquo;t have a home to come to in your vacations, that&rsquo;s all, but
      I suppose you&rsquo;ll manage somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla broke down and wept bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t sell Green Gables,&rdquo; said Anne resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anne, I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to. But you can see for yourself. I can&rsquo;t
      stay here alone. I&rsquo;d go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my sight
      would go&mdash;I know it would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to stay here alone, Marilla. I&rsquo;ll be with you. I&rsquo;m not
      going to Redmond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going to Redmond!&rdquo; Marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and
      looked at Anne. &ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say. I&rsquo;m not going to take the scholarship. I decided so the
      night after you came home from town. You surely don&rsquo;t think I could leave
      you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you&rsquo;ve done for me. I&rsquo;ve
      been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry wants to
      rent the farm for next year. So you won&rsquo;t have any bother over that. And
      I&rsquo;m going to teach. I&rsquo;ve applied for the school here&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t
      expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to Gilbert
      Blythe. But I can have the Carmody school&mdash;Mr. Blair told me so last
      night at the store. Of course that won&rsquo;t be quite as nice or convenient as
      if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and drive myself over to
      Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And even in winter I can
      come home Fridays. We&rsquo;ll keep a horse for that. Oh, I have it all planned
      out, Marilla. And I&rsquo;ll read to you and keep you cheered up. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
      dull or lonesome. And we&rsquo;ll be real cozy and happy here together, you and
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla had listened like a woman in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know. But I can&rsquo;t
      let you sacrifice yourself so for me. It would be terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Anne laughed merrily. &ldquo;There is no sacrifice. Nothing could be
      worse than giving up Green Gables&mdash;nothing could hurt me more. We
      must keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla. I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>
      going to Redmond; and I <i>am</i> going to stay here and teach. Don&rsquo;t you
      worry about me a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your ambitions&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as ambitious as ever. Only, I&rsquo;ve changed the object of my
      ambitions. I&rsquo;m going to be a good teacher&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to save your
      eyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little college
      course all by myself. Oh, I&rsquo;ve dozens of plans, Marilla. I&rsquo;ve been
      thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best, and I
      believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen&rsquo;s my
      future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I
      could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I
      don&rsquo;t know what lies around the bend, but I&rsquo;m going to believe that the
      best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder
      how the road beyond it goes&mdash;what there is of green glory and soft,
      checkered light and shadows&mdash;what new landscapes&mdash;what new
      beauties&mdash;what curves and hills and valleys further on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel as if I ought to let you give it up,&rdquo; said Marilla,
      referring to the scholarship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t prevent me. I&rsquo;m sixteen and a half, &lsquo;obstinate as a mule,&rsquo; 
      as Mrs. Lynde once told me,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;Oh, Marilla, don&rsquo;t you go
      pitying me. I don&rsquo;t like to be pitied, and there is no need for it. I&rsquo;m
      heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green Gables. Nobody
      could love it as you and I do&mdash;so we must keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You blessed girl!&rdquo; said Marilla, yielding. &ldquo;I feel as if you&rsquo;d given me
      new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college&mdash;but
      I know I can&rsquo;t, so I ain&rsquo;t going to try. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you though,
      Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up the
      idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there was a
      good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not knowing about
      Marilla&rsquo;s eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did not. She told Anne
      so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure to the girl&rsquo;s eyes.
      Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening and found Anne and
      Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm, scented summer dusk. They
      liked to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew
      about in the garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the
      door, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a
      long breath of mingled weariness and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare I&rsquo;m getting glad to sit down. I&rsquo;ve been on my feet all day, and
      two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It&rsquo;s a great
      blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well, Anne, I
      hear you&rsquo;ve given up your notion of going to college. I was real glad to
      hear it. You&rsquo;ve got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable
      with. I don&rsquo;t believe in girls going to college with the men and cramming
      their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,&rdquo; said
      Anne laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take my Arts course right here at Green
      Gables, and study everything that I would at college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Shirley, you&rsquo;ll kill yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to overdo
      things. As &lsquo;Josiah Allen&rsquo;s wife,&rsquo; says, I shall be &lsquo;mejum&rsquo;. But I&rsquo;ll have
      lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I&rsquo;ve no vocation for
      fancy work. I&rsquo;m going to teach over at Carmody, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it. I guess you&rsquo;re going to teach right here in Avonlea. The
      trustees have decided to give you the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lynde!&rdquo; cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. &ldquo;Why, I
      thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it he
      went to them&mdash;they had a business meeting at the school last night,
      you know&mdash;and told them that he withdrew his application, and
      suggested that they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White
      Sands. Of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I
      must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that&rsquo;s what. Real
      self-sacrificing, too, for he&rsquo;ll have his board to pay at White Sands, and
      everybody knows he&rsquo;s got to earn his own way through college. So the
      trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came home
      and told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that I ought to take it,&rdquo; murmured Anne. &ldquo;I mean&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t think I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for&mdash;for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you can&rsquo;t prevent him now. He&rsquo;s signed papers with the White
      Sands trustees. So it wouldn&rsquo;t do him any good now if you were to refuse.
      Of course you&rsquo;ll take the school. You&rsquo;ll get along all right, now that
      there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a good thing she
      was, that&rsquo;s what. There&rsquo;s been some Pye or other going to Avonlea school
      for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in life was to keep
      school teachers reminded that earth isn&rsquo;t their home. Bless my heart! What
      does all that winking and blinking at the Barry gable mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana is signaling for me to go over,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;You know we keep up
      the old custom. Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry
      shadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal more of the woman about her in others,&rdquo; retorted
      Marilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But crispness was no longer Marilla&rsquo;s distinguishing characteristic. As
      Mrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marilla Cuthbert has got <i>mellow</i>. That&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh
      flowers on Matthew&rsquo;s grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She lingered
      there until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place, with its
      poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its whispering
      grasses growing at will among the graves. When she finally left it and
      walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining Waters it was
      past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight&mdash;&ldquo;a
      haunt of ancient peace.&rdquo; There was a freshness in the air as of a wind
      that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home lights twinkled out
      here and there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay the sea, misty and
      purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west was a glory of soft
      mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in still softer shadings.
      The beauty of it all thrilled Anne&rsquo;s heart, and she gratefully opened the
      gates of her soul to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old world,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you are very lovely, and I am glad to be
      alive in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the
      Blythe homestead. It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he
      recognized Anne. He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed
      on in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; she said, with scarlet cheeks, &ldquo;I want to thank you for giving
      up the school for me. It was very good of you&mdash;and I want you to know
      that I appreciate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert took the offered hand eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be able
      to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after this? Have
      you really forgiven me my old fault?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn&rsquo;t know it.
      What a stubborn little goose I was. I&rsquo;ve been&mdash;I may as well make a
      complete confession&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been sorry ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to be the best of friends,&rdquo; said Gilbert, jubilantly. &ldquo;We
      were born to be good friends, Anne. You&rsquo;ve thwarted destiny enough. I know
      we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your
      studies, aren&rsquo;t you? So am I. Come, I&rsquo;m going to walk home with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert Blythe,&rdquo; answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. &ldquo;I met
      him on Barry&rsquo;s hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you&rsquo;d
      stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,&rdquo; said Marilla with a
      dry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been good enemies. But we have decided that
      it will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we
      really there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see, we
      have five years&rsquo; lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content. The
      wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came up to
      her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and Diana&rsquo;s
      light gleamed through the old gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne&rsquo;s horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after
      coming home from Queen&rsquo;s; but if the path set before her feet was to be
      narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it. The
      joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship were to
      be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her ideal
      world of dreams. And there was always the bend in the road!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;God&rsquo;s in his heaven, all&rsquo;s right with the world,&rsquo;&rdquo; whispered Anne
      softly.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

The Foundation&rsquo;s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
