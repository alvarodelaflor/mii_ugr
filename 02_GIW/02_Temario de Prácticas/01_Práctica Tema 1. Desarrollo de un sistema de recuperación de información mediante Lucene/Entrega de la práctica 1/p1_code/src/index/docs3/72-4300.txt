A yellow\r\ndressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild\r\nmorning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Introibo ad altare Dei_.\r\n\r\nHalted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!\r\n\r\nSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\r\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\r\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\r\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat\r\nand shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned\r\nhis arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking\r\ngurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light\r\nuntonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the\r\nbowl smartly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Back to barracks! he said sternly.\r\n\r\nHe added in a preacher\xe2\x80\x99s tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul\r\nand blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One\r\nmoment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.\r\n\r\nHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused\r\nawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and\r\nthere with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles\r\nanswered through the calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off\r\nthe current, will you?\r\n\r\nHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering\r\nabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and\r\nsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.\r\nA pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!\r\n\r\nHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,\r\nlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily\r\nhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as\r\nhe propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and\r\nlathered cheeks and neck.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s gay voice went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a\r\nHellenic ring, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We\r\nmust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out\r\ntwenty quid?\r\n\r\nHe laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will he come? The jejune jesuit!\r\n\r\nCeasing, he began to shave with care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, my love?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money\r\nand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you\r\nhave the real Oxford manner. He can\xe2\x80\x99t make you out. O, my name for you\r\nis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.\r\n\r\nHe shaved warily over his chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is\r\nhis guncase?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark\r\nwith a man I don\xe2\x80\x99t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\r\nblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a hero, however. If\r\nhe stays on here I am off.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down\r\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Scutter! he cried thickly.\r\n\r\nHe came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s upper\r\npocket, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.\r\n\r\nStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\r\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\r\nThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The bard\xe2\x80\x99s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\r\nYou can almost taste it, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\r\noakpale hair stirring slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God! he said quietly. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\r\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa\r\nponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them\r\nin the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.\r\nCome and look.\r\n\r\nStephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\r\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\r\nKingstown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That\xe2\x80\x99s why she won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet me have anything to do with you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother\r\nasked you, Buck Mulligan said. I\xe2\x80\x99m hyperborean as much as you. But to\r\nthink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and\r\npray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....\r\n\r\nHe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant\r\nsmile curled his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest\r\nmummer of them all!\r\n\r\nHe shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.\r\n\r\nStephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\r\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\r\nPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently,\r\nin a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within\r\nits loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,\r\nher breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\r\nwetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\r\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and\r\nskyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had\r\nstood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had\r\ntorn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt\r\nand a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They fit well enough, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God\r\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair\r\nstripe, grey. You\xe2\x80\x99ll look spiffing in them. I\xe2\x80\x99m not joking, Kinch. You\r\nlook damn well when you\xe2\x80\x99re dressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, Stephen said. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wear them if they are grey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He can\xe2\x80\x99t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.\r\nEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can\xe2\x80\x99t wear grey\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nHe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\r\nsmooth skin.\r\n\r\nStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\r\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,\r\nsays you have g. p. i. He\xe2\x80\x99s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.\r\nGeneral paralysis of the insane!\r\n\r\nHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings\r\nabroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips\r\nlaughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized\r\nall his strong wellknit trunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!\r\n\r\nStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by\r\na crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this\r\nface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I pinched it out of the skivvy\xe2\x80\x99s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her\r\nall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.\r\nLead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.\r\n\r\nLaughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s peering eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If\r\nWilde were only alive to see you!\r\n\r\nDrawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s and walked with him\r\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he\r\nhad thrust them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.\r\nGod knows you have more spirit than any of them.\r\n\r\nParried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\r\ncold steel pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap\r\ndownstairs and touch him for a guinea. He\xe2\x80\x99s stinking with money and\r\nthinks you\xe2\x80\x99re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling\r\njalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and\r\nI could only work together we might do something for the island.\r\nHellenise it.\r\n\r\nCranly\xe2\x80\x99s arm. His arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one\r\nthat knows what you are. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you trust me more? What have you up\r\nyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring down Seymour and we\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a ragging worse than they gave\r\nClive Kempthorpe.\r\n\r\nYoung shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. Palefaces:\r\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall\r\nexpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit\r\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\r\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the\r\ntailor\xe2\x80\x99s shears. A scared calf\xe2\x80\x99s face gilded with marmalade. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be debagged! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you play the giddy ox with me!\r\n\r\nShouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf\r\ngardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s face, pushes his mower\r\non the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.\r\n\r\nTo ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let him stay, Stephen said. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with him except at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite frank with you. What have you against me now?\r\n\r\nThey halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on\r\nthe water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything.\r\n\r\nHe looked in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,\r\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\r\nanxiety in his eyes.\r\n\r\nStephen, depressed by his own voice, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Where? I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything. I remember only ideas and\r\nsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get\r\nmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the\r\ndrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You said, Stephen answered, _O, it\xe2\x80\x99s only Dedalus whose mother is\r\nbeastly dead._\r\n\r\nA flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck\r\nMulligan\xe2\x80\x99s cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?\r\n\r\nHe shook his constraint from him nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what is death, he asked, your mother\xe2\x80\x99s or yours or my own? You saw\r\nonly your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and\r\nRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beastly\r\nthing and nothing else. It simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kneel\r\ndown to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?\r\nBecause you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it\xe2\x80\x99s injected\r\nthe wrong way. To me it\xe2\x80\x99s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes\r\nare not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks\r\nbuttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it\xe2\x80\x99s over. You crossed her\r\nlast wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don\xe2\x80\x99t whinge like\r\nsome hired mute from Lalouette\xe2\x80\x99s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to offend the memory of your mother.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping\r\nwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan swung round on his heel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,\r\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now\r\ngrew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he\r\nfelt the fever of his cheeks.\r\n\r\nA voice within the tower called loudly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you up there, Mulligan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards Stephen and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,\r\nKinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.\r\n\r\nHis head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\r\nwith the roof:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t mope over it all day, he said. I\xe2\x80\x99m inconsequent. Give up the\r\nmoody brooding.\r\n\r\nHis head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of\r\nthe stairhead:\r\n\r\n     And no more turn aside and brood\r\n     Upon love\xe2\x80\x99s bitter mystery\r\n     For Fergus rules the brazen cars.\r\n\r\nWoodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\r\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of\r\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the\r\ndim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the\r\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words\r\nshimmering on the dim tide.\r\n\r\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\r\ndeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsong: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.\r\nHer door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and\r\npity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For\r\nthose words, Stephen: love\xe2\x80\x99s bitter mystery.\r\n\r\nWhere now?\r\n\r\nHer secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,\r\na gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the\r\nsunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing\r\nin the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n     I am the boy\r\n     That can enjoy\r\n     Invisibility.\r\n\r\nPhantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.\r\n\r\n     And no more turn aside and brood.\r\n\r\n\r\nFolded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his\r\nbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\r\napproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\r\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely\r\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshirts.\r\n\r\nIn a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\r\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\r\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.\r\n\r\nHer glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On\r\nme alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the\r\ntortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all\r\nprayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata\r\nrutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum\r\nchorus excipiat._\r\n\r\nGhoul! Chewer of corpses!\r\n\r\nNo, mother! Let me be and let me live.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kinch ahoy!\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the\r\nstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul\xe2\x80\x99s cry,\r\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is\r\napologising for waking us last night. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m coming, Stephen said, turning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do, for Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our\r\nsakes.\r\n\r\nHis head disappeared and reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s very clever. Touch\r\nhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I get paid this morning, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you want it, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\na glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nHe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\r\ntune with a Cockney accent:\r\n\r\n     O, won\xe2\x80\x99t we have a merry time,\r\n     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!\r\n     On coronation,\r\n     Coronation day!\r\n     O, won\xe2\x80\x99t we have a merry time\r\n     On coronation day!\r\n\r\nWarm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,\r\nforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it\r\nthere all day, forgotten friendship?\r\n\r\nHe went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\r\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.\r\nSo I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now\r\nand yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.\r\n\r\nIn the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s gowned form\r\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\r\nyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\r\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\r\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?\r\n\r\nStephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the\r\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\r\nthe inner doors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you the key? a voice asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I\xe2\x80\x99m choked!\r\n\r\nHe howled, without looking up from the fire:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kinch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.\r\n\r\nThe key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been\r\nset ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the\r\ndoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and\r\nsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside\r\nhim. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set\r\nthem down heavily and sighed with relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a\r\nword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.\r\nHaines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy\r\ngifts. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the sugar? O, jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s no milk.\r\n\r\nStephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from\r\nthe locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lemon in the\r\nlocker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nHaines came in from the doorway and said quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That woman is coming up with the milk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his\r\nchair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t go fumbling at the damned eggs.\r\n\r\nHe hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three\r\nplates, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._\r\n\r\nHaines sat down to pour out the tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do\r\nmake strong tea, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s wheedling voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I\r\nmakes water I makes water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God\r\nsend you don\xe2\x80\x99t make them in the one pot._\r\n\r\nHe lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled\r\non his knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines\r\nof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of\r\nDundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his\r\nbrows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan\xe2\x80\x99s tea and water pot spoken\r\nof in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\r\nMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s face smiled with delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth\r\nand blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\r\nrasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94For old Mary Ann\r\n\r\nShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn.\r\n\r\nBut, hising up her petticoats..._\r\n\r\nHe crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.\r\n\r\nThe doorway was darkened by an entering form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The milk, sir!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.\r\n\r\nAn old woman came forward and stood by Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!\r\n\r\nStephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of\r\nthe collector of prepuces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How much, sir? asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A quart, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHe watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white\r\nmilk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a\r\ntilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a\r\nmessenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\r\nCrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on\r\nher toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They\r\nlowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and\r\npoor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly\r\nform of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their\r\ncommon cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to\r\nupbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is indeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Taste it, sir, she said.\r\n\r\nHe drank at her bidding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\r\nloudly, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\r\nguts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved\r\nwith dust, horsedung and consumptives\xe2\x80\x99 spits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Buck Mulligan answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at that now, she said.\r\n\r\nStephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice\r\nthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\r\nslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there\r\nis of her but her woman\xe2\x80\x99s unclean loins, of man\xe2\x80\x99s flesh made not in\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s likeness, the serpent\xe2\x80\x99s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids\r\nher be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.\r\n\r\nHaines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the\r\nwest, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am an Englishman, Haines answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak\r\nIrish in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\nthe language myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m told it\xe2\x80\x99s a grand language by them that knows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill\r\nus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\r\nmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.\r\n\r\nHaines said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\r\n\r\nStephen filled again the three cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s seven mornings a pint at\r\ntwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\r\nmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\r\nbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search\r\nhis trouser pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.\r\n\r\nStephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the\r\nthick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in\r\nhis fingers and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A miracle!\r\n\r\nHe passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.\r\n\r\nStephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll owe twopence, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good\r\nmorning, sir.\r\n\r\nShe curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s tender chant:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Heart of my heart, were it more,\r\n\r\nMore would be laid at your feet._\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seriously, Dedalus. I\xe2\x80\x99m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring\r\nus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland\r\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your\r\nnational library today.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and asked blandly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?\r\n\r\nThen he said to Haines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey\r\ntrickle over a slice of the loaf.\r\n\r\nHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\r\nloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.\r\nConscience. Yet here\xe2\x80\x99s a spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\r\nof Irish art is deuced good.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan kicked Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s foot under the table and said with\r\nwarmth of tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just\r\nthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\nHaines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of\r\nthe hammock, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen\r\nand said with coarse vigour:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the\r\nmilkwoman or from him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a toss up, I think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along\r\nwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94From me, Kinch, he said.\r\n\r\nIn a suddenly changed tone he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To tell you the God\xe2\x80\x99s truth I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Damn all else they\r\nare good for. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you play them as I do? To hell with them all.\r\nLet us get out of the kip.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\r\nresignedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mulligan is stripped of his garments.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his pockets on to the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s your snotrag, he said.\r\n\r\nAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\r\nchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and\r\nrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green\r\nboots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I\r\ncontradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of\r\nhis talking hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And there\xe2\x80\x99s your Latin quarter hat, he said.\r\n\r\nStephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the\r\ndoorway:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you coming, you fellows?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,\r\nKinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out\r\nwith grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And going forth he met Butterly.\r\n\r\nStephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\r\nand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\r\nlocked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you bring the key?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.\r\n\r\nHe walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy\r\nbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Down, sir! How dare you, sir!\r\n\r\nHaines asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you pay rent for this tower?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on\r\nthe sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I\xe2\x80\x99m not equal to Thomas Aquinas\r\nand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I\r\nhave a few pints in me first.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\r\nprimrose waistcoat:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s grandson is\r\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\r\nloose laughter, said to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is\r\nrather long to tell.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this\r\ntower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That\r\nbeetles o\xe2\x80\x99er his base into the sea,_ isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did\r\nnot speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in\r\ncheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.\r\n\r\nEyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\r\nThe seas\xe2\x80\x99 ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the\r\nsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail\r\ntacking by the Muglins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\r\nThe Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked\r\nat them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\r\nsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved\r\na doll\xe2\x80\x99s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and\r\nbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.\r\nMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s a jew, my father\xe2\x80\x99s a bird.\r\nWith Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.\r\nSo here\xe2\x80\x99s to disciples and Calvary._\r\n\r\nHe held up a forefinger of warning.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94If anyone thinks that I amn\xe2\x80\x99t divine\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll get no free drinks when I\xe2\x80\x99m making the wine\r\nBut have to drink water and wish it were plain\r\nThat I make when the wine becomes water again._\r\n\r\nHe tugged swiftly at Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ashplant in farewell and, running\r\nforward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like\r\nfins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said\r\nAnd tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly\r\nAnd Olivet\xe2\x80\x99s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_\r\n\r\nHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his\r\nwinglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s hat quivering in the fresh\r\nwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.\r\n\r\nHaines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to laugh, I suppose. He\xe2\x80\x99s rather blasphemous. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\r\nbeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of\r\nit somehow, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Haines said, you have heard it before?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in\r\nthe narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a\r\npersonal God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a\r\ngreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.\r\n\r\nHaines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his\r\nsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\r\nit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\r\ntowards Stephen in the shell of his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Personally I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stomach that idea of a\r\npersonal God. You don\xe2\x80\x99t stand for that, I suppose?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\r\nexample of free thought.\r\n\r\nHe walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his\r\nside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.\r\nMy familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line\r\nalong the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.\r\nHe wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt\r\nbread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After all, Haines began...\r\n\r\nStephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was\r\nnot all unkind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your\r\nown master, it seems to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an\r\nItalian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Italian? Haines said.\r\n\r\nA crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and\r\nthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\r\n\r\nHaines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think\r\nlike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you\r\nrather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\r\n\r\nThe proud potent titles clanged over Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s memory the triumph of\r\ntheir brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam\r\necclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own\r\nrare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass\r\nfor pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in\r\naffirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church\r\nmilitant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies\r\nfleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom\r\nMulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the\r\nconsubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who\r\nheld that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken\r\na moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void\r\nawaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a\r\nworsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael\xe2\x80\x99s host, who\r\ndefend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their\r\nshields.\r\n\r\nHear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m a Britisher, Haines\xe2\x80\x99s voice said, and I feel as one. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s our national problem, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, just now.\r\n\r\nTwo men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,\r\nboatman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She\xe2\x80\x99s making for Bullock harbour.\r\n\r\nThe boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s five fathoms out there, he said. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be swept up that way\r\nwhen the tide comes in about one. It\xe2\x80\x99s nine days today.\r\n\r\nThe man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting\r\nfor a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,\r\nsaltwhite. Here I am.\r\n\r\nThey followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood\r\non a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his\r\nshoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly\r\nfrogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is the brother with you, Malachi?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young\r\nthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near\r\nthe spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,\r\nwater glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water\r\nrilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black\r\nsagging loincloth.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines\r\nand Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and\r\nlips and breastbone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seymour\xe2\x80\x99s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of\r\nrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is she up the pole?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Better ask Seymour that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying\r\ntritely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Redheaded women buck like goats.\r\n\r\nHe broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I\xe2\x80\x99m the _\xc3\x9cbermensch._ Toothless\r\nKinch and I, the supermen.\r\n\r\nHe struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his\r\nclothes lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going in here, Malachi?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Make room in the bed.\r\n\r\nThe young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the\r\nmiddle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a\r\nstone, smoking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.\r\n\r\nStephen turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going, Mulligan, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.\r\n\r\nStephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.\r\n\r\nStephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck\r\nMulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake\r\nZarathustra.\r\n\r\nHis plump body plunged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the\r\npath and smiling at wild Irish.\r\n\r\nHorn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHe walked along the upwardcurving path.\r\n\r\n     Liliata rutilantium.\r\n     Turma circumdet.\r\n     Iubilantium te virginum.\r\n\r\nThe priest\xe2\x80\x99s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will\r\nnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.\r\n\r\nA voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning\r\nthe curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a\r\nseal\xe2\x80\x99s, far out on the water, round.\r\n\r\nUsurper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 2 ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tarentum, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very good. Well?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a battle, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very good. Where?\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s blank face asked the blank window.\r\n\r\nFabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as\r\nmemory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake\xe2\x80\x99s wings\r\nof excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling\r\nmasonry, and time one livid final flame. What\xe2\x80\x99s left us then?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the\r\ngorescarred book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done\r\nfor._\r\n\r\nThat phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a\r\nhill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,\r\nleaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94End of Pyrrhus, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?\r\n\r\nA bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong\xe2\x80\x99s satchel. He curled them\r\nbetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered\r\nto the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy\xe2\x80\x99s breath. Welloff people,\r\nproud that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.\r\n\r\nAll laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round\r\nat his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh\r\nmore loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder with the book,\r\nwhat is a pier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a\r\nbridge. Kingstown pier, sir.\r\n\r\nSome laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench\r\nwhispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.\r\nAll. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their\r\nlikes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets\r\ntittering in the struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.\r\n\r\nThe words troubled their gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.\r\n\r\nFor Haines\xe2\x80\x99s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild\r\ndrink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A\r\njester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a\r\nclement master\xe2\x80\x99s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly\r\nfor the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other\r\ntoo often heard, their land a pawnshop.\r\n\r\nHad Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam\xe2\x80\x99s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not\r\nbeen knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded\r\nthem and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite\r\npossibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing\r\nthat they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?\r\nWeave, weaver of the wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell us a story, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, do, sir. A ghoststory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on then, Talbot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the story, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.\r\n\r\nA swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork\r\nof his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more\r\nFor Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,\r\nSunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._\r\n\r\nIt must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.\r\nAristotle\xe2\x80\x99s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated\r\nout into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where\r\nhe had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his\r\nelbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding\r\nbrains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating\r\nfeelers: and in my mind\xe2\x80\x99s darkness a sloth of the underworld,\r\nreluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought\r\nis the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner\r\nall that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast,\r\ncandescent: form of forms.\r\n\r\nTalbot repeated:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,\r\n\r\nThrough the dear might..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.\r\n\r\nHis hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having\r\njust remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these\r\ncraven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer\xe2\x80\x99s heart and lips and\r\non mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the\r\ntribute. To Caesar what is Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s, to God what is God\xe2\x80\x99s. A long look\r\nfrom dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the\r\nchurch\xe2\x80\x99s looms. Ay.\r\n\r\n     Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.\r\n     My father gave me seeds to sow.\r\n\r\nTalbot slid his closed book into his satchel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have I heard all? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half day, sir. Thursday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\nThey bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.\r\nCrowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all\r\ngabbling gaily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, ask me, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A hard one, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This is the riddle, Stephen said:\r\n\r\n     The cock crew,\r\n     The sky was blue:\r\n     The bells in heaven\r\n     Were striking eleven.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x99Tis time for this poor soul\r\n     To go to heaven.\r\n\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Again, sir. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence\r\nCochrane said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it, sir? We give it up.\r\n\r\nStephen, his throat itching, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries\r\nechoed dismay.\r\n\r\nA stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hockey!\r\n\r\nThey broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly\r\nthey were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and\r\nclamour of their boots and tongues.\r\n\r\nSargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open\r\ncopybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness\r\nand through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his\r\ncheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent\r\nand damp as a snail\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\n\r\nHe held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.\r\nBeneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with\r\nblind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them\r\nto you, sir.\r\n\r\nStephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to\r\ncopy them off the board, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, sir.\r\n\r\nUgly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a\r\nsnail\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in\r\nher heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him\r\nunderfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery\r\nblood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in\r\nlife? His mother\xe2\x80\x99s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal\r\nbestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in\r\nthe fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from\r\nbeing trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor\r\nsoul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red\r\nreek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the\r\nearth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.\r\n\r\nSitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by\r\nalgebra that Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s ghost is Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather. Sargent\r\npeered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the\r\nlumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.\r\n\r\nAcross the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of\r\ntheir letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,\r\ntraverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from\r\nthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and\r\nmovement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the\r\nworld, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nIn long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a\r\nword of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint\r\nhue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective\r\nand objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had\r\nfed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.\r\n\r\nLike him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My\r\nchildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or\r\nlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony\r\nsit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their\r\ntyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.\r\n\r\nThe sum was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.\r\n\r\nHe dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his\r\ncopybook back to his bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said\r\nas he followed towards the door the boy\xe2\x80\x99s graceless form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sargent!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.\r\n\r\nHe stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy\r\nfield where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and\r\nMr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.\r\nWhen he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to\r\nhim. He turned his angry white moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it now? he cried continually without listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore\r\norder here.\r\n\r\nAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\ncried sternly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is the matter? What is it now?\r\n\r\nTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms\r\nclosed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his\r\nilldyed head.\r\n\r\nStale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded\r\nleather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here.\r\nAs it was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart\r\ncoins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their\r\nspooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached\r\nto all the gentiles: world without end.\r\n\r\nA hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his\r\nrare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94First, our little financial settlement, he said.\r\n\r\nHe brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It\r\nslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and\r\nlaid them carefully on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.\r\n\r\nAnd now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassed hand moved\r\nover the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money\r\ncowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir\xe2\x80\x99s turban, and\r\nthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s hoard, dead\r\ntreasure, hollow shells.\r\n\r\nA sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.\r\nThese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is\r\nfor shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.\r\n\r\nHe shot from it two crowns and two shillings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three twelve, he said. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy\r\nhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.\r\n\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too\r\nof beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed\r\nand misery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You\xe2\x80\x99ll pull it out somewhere\r\nand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find them very\r\nhandy.\r\n\r\nAnswer something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nThe same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times\r\nnow. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant\r\nif I will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as\r\nI have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare\r\nsay? _Put but money in thy purse._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Iago, Stephen murmured.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but\r\nan Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you\r\nknow what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth?\r\n\r\nThe seas\xe2\x80\x99 ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems\r\nhistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That\xe2\x80\x99s not English. A French Celt said that. He\r\ntapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid\r\nmy way._\r\n\r\nGood man, good man.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel\r\nthat? _I owe nothing._ Can you?\r\n\r\nMulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.\r\nCurran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.\r\nTemple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob\r\nReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x99 board. The lump I have is useless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For the moment, no, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I knew you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.\r\nWe are a generous people but we must also be just.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the\r\nshapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of\r\nWales.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.\r\nI saw three generations since O\xe2\x80\x99Connell\xe2\x80\x99s time. I remember the famine\r\nin \xe2\x80\x9946. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the\r\nunion twenty years before O\xe2\x80\x99Connell did or before the prelates of your\r\ncommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.\r\n\r\nGlorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the\r\nsplendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the\r\nplanters\xe2\x80\x99 covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nStephen sketched a brief gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But\r\nI am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are\r\nall Irish, all kings\xe2\x80\x99 sons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Alas, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for\r\nit and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n     Lal the ral the ra\r\n     The rocky road to Dublin.\r\n\r\nA gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!\r\nSoft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on\r\nto Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,\r\nwith some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.\r\nSit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.\r\n\r\nHe went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read\r\noff some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of\r\ncommon sense._ Just a moment.\r\n\r\nHe peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow\r\nand, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,\r\nsometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.\r\n\r\nStephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed\r\naround the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek\r\nheads poised in air: lord Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 _Repulse_, the duke of\r\nWestminster\xe2\x80\x99s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort\xe2\x80\x99s _Ceylon_, _prix de\r\nParis_, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their\r\nspeeds, backing king\xe2\x80\x99s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished\r\ncrowds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of this\r\nallimportant question..._\r\n\r\nWhere Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the\r\nmudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek\r\nof the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to\r\none the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,\r\nthe vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.\r\n\r\nShouts rang shrill from the boys\xe2\x80\x99 playfield and a whirring whistle.\r\n\r\nAgain: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a\r\nmedley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother\xe2\x80\x99s darling\r\nwho seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock\r\nby shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of\r\nthe slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men\xe2\x80\x99s bloodied guts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.\r\n\r\nHe came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the\r\nfoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two\r\nopinions on the matter.\r\n\r\nMay I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_\r\nwhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old\r\nindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.\r\nEuropean conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the\r\nchannel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of\r\nagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who\r\nwas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.\r\n\r\nFoot and mouth disease. Known as Koch\xe2\x80\x99s preparation. Serum and virus.\r\nPercentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s horses at M\xc3\xbcrzsteg,\r\nlower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous\r\noffer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In\r\nevery sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for\r\nthe hospitality of your columns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the\r\nnext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be\r\ncured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is\r\nregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They\r\noffer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the\r\ndepartment. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by\r\ndifficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...\r\n\r\nHe raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the\r\njews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are\r\nthe signs of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the\r\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as\r\nwe are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of\r\ndestruction. Old England is dying.\r\n\r\nHe stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a\r\nbroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.\r\n\r\n     The harlot\xe2\x80\x99s cry from street to street\r\n     Shall weave old England\xe2\x80\x99s windingsheet.\r\n\r\nHis eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which\r\nhe halted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or\r\ngentile, is he not?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see\r\nthe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the\r\nearth to this day.\r\n\r\nOn the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting\r\nprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,\r\nuncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit\r\nsilk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.\r\nTheir full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and\r\nunoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their\r\nzeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would\r\nscatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.\r\nTheir eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the\r\ndishonours of their flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who has not? Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.\r\n\r\nHe came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell\r\nsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\r\n\r\nFrom the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.\r\nWhat if that nightmare gave you a back kick?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human\r\nhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.\r\n\r\nStephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That is God.\r\n\r\nHooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Deasy asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked\r\nbetween his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and\r\nmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no\r\nbetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten\r\nyears the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the\r\nstrangers to our shore here, MacMurrough\xe2\x80\x99s wife and her leman,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many\r\nerrors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the\r\nend of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.\r\n\r\n     For Ulster will fight\r\n     And Ulster will be right.\r\n\r\nStephen raised the sheets in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, sir, he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at\r\nthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A learner rather, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nAnd here what will you learn more?\r\n\r\nMr Deasy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nStephen rustled the sheets again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As regards these, he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them\r\npublished at once.\r\n\r\n_ Telegraph. Irish Homestead._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two\r\neditors slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,\r\nM.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders\xe2\x80\x99 association today at the\r\nCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You\r\nsee if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94The Evening Telegraph..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to\r\nanswer that letter from my cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I\r\nlike to break a lance with you, old as I am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.\r\n\r\nHe went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,\r\nhearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The\r\nlions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:\r\ntoothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will\r\ndub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dedalus!\r\n\r\nRunning after me. No more letters, I hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just one moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of\r\nbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know\r\nthat? No. And do you know why?\r\n\r\nHe frowned sternly on the bright air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.\r\n\r\nA coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a\r\nrattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,\r\nhis lifted arms waving to the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he\r\nstamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That\xe2\x80\x99s why.\r\n\r\nOn his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung\r\nspangles, dancing coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 3 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nIneluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought\r\nthrough my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn\r\nand seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver,\r\nrust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.\r\nThen he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By\r\nknocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a\r\nmillionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_. Limit of the diaphane in.\r\nWhy in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through\r\nit it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.\r\n\r\nStephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and\r\nshells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a\r\ntime. A very short space of time through very short times of space.\r\nFive, six: the _nacheinander_. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable\r\nmodality of the audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a\r\ncliff that beetles o\xe2\x80\x99er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_\r\nineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at\r\nmy side. Tap with it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends\r\nof his legs, _nebeneinander_. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los\r\nDemiurgos_. Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush,\r\ncrack, crick, crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n     Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come to Sandymount,\r\n     Madeline the mare?\r\n\r\nRhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs\r\nmarching. No, agallop: _deline the mare_.\r\n\r\nOpen your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I\r\nopen and am for ever in the black adiaphane. _Basta!_ I will see if I\r\ncan see.\r\n\r\nSee now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world\r\nwithout end.\r\n\r\nThey came down the steps from Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s terrace prudently,\r\n_Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed\r\nfeet sinking in the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our\r\nmighty mother. Number one swung lourdily her midwife\xe2\x80\x99s bag, the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngamp poked in the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs\r\nFlorence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of\r\nBride Street. One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.\r\nCreation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a\r\ntrailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back,\r\nstrandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you\r\nbe as gods? Gaze in your _omphalos_. Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to\r\nEdenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.\r\n\r\nSpouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.\r\nGaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,\r\nwhiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to\r\neverlasting. Womb of sin.\r\n\r\nWombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man\r\nwith my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.\r\nThey clasped and sundered, did the coupler\xe2\x80\x99s will. From before the ages\r\nHe willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A _lex eterna_ stays\r\nabout Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are\r\nconsubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring\r\nhis life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred\r\nheresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.\r\nWith beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of\r\na widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.\r\n\r\nAirs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.\r\nThe whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of\r\nMananaan.\r\n\r\nI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half\r\ntwelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.\r\nYes, I must.\r\n\r\nHis pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara\xe2\x80\x99s or not? My\r\nconsubstantial father\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Did you see anything of your artist\r\nbrother Stephen lately? No? Sure he\xe2\x80\x99s not down in Strasburg terrace\r\nwith his aunt Sally? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And\r\nand and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the\r\nthings I married into! De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little\r\ncostdrawer and his brother, the cornet player. Highly respectable\r\ngondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes,\r\nsir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!\r\n\r\nI pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take\r\nme for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let him in. Let Stephen in.\r\n\r\nA bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We thought you were someone else.\r\n\r\nIn his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over\r\nthe hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed\r\nthe upper moiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Morrow, nephew.\r\n\r\nHe lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the\r\neyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and\r\ncommon searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_. A bogoak frame over his\r\nbald head: Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s _Requiescat_. The drone of his misleading whistle\r\nbrings Walter back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bathing Crissie, sir.\r\n\r\nPapa\xe2\x80\x99s little bedpal. Lump of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, uncle Richie...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Uncle Richie, really...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sit down or by the law Harry I\xe2\x80\x99ll knock you down.\r\n\r\nWalter squints vainly for a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has nothing to sit down on, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.\r\nWould you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs\r\nhere. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the\r\nbetter. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.\r\n\r\n_All\xe2\x80\x99erta!_\r\n\r\nHe drones bars of Ferrando\xe2\x80\x99s _aria di sortita_. The grandest number,\r\nStephen, in the whole opera. Listen.\r\n\r\nHis tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the\r\nair, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.\r\n\r\nThis wind is sweeter.\r\n\r\nHouses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you\r\nhad an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of\r\nthem, Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlibrary where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For\r\nwhom? The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his\r\nkind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the\r\nmoon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine\r\nfaces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas father,\r\nfurious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff! _Descende,\r\ncalve, ut ne nimium decalveris_. A garland of grey hair on his\r\ncomminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace\r\n(_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down,\r\nbaldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the\r\naltar\xe2\x80\x99s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their\r\nalbs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating\r\nit. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.\r\nDringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own\r\ncheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that,\r\ninvincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled\r\nhis brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his\r\nsecond bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,\r\nrising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang\r\nin diphthong.\r\n\r\nCousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were\r\nawfully holy, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you\r\nmight not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue\r\nthat the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from\r\nthe wet street. _O si, certo!_ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags\r\npinned round a squaw. More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth\r\ntram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women!_ What about\r\nthat, eh?\r\n\r\nWhat about what? What else were they invented for?\r\n\r\nReading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.\r\nYou bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause\r\nearnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one\r\nsaw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for\r\ntitles. Have you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is\r\nwonderful. O yes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval\r\nleaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great\r\nlibraries of the world, including Alexandria? Someone was to read them\r\nthere after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della\r\nMirandola like. Ay, very like a whale. When one reads these strange\r\npages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who\r\nonce...\r\n\r\nThe grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a\r\ndamp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the\r\nunnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.\r\nUnwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing\r\nupward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a\r\nmidden of man\xe2\x80\x99s ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle\r\nstood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel:\r\nisle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze\r\nof dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the\r\nhigher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams\r\nof brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.\r\n\r\nHe halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara\xe2\x80\x99s. Am I not going there?\r\nSeems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer\r\nsand towards the Pigeonhouse.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94C\xe2\x80\x99est le pigeon, Joseph._\r\n\r\nPatrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar\r\nMacMahon. Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbird, he lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump\r\nbunny\xe2\x80\x99s face. Lap, _lapin._ He hopes to win in the _gros lots_. About\r\nthe nature of women he read in Michelet. But he must send me _La Vie de\r\nJ\xc3\xa9sus_ by M. L\xc3\xa9o Taxil. Lent it to his friend.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94C\xe2\x80\x99est tordant, vous savez. Moi, je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas\r\nen l\xe2\x80\x99existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire \xc3\xa0 mon p\xc3\xa8re._\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Il croit?_\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Mon p\xc3\xa8re, oui._\r\n\r\n_Schluss_. He laps.\r\n\r\nMy Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want\r\npuce gloves. You were a student, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Of what in the other\r\ndevil\xe2\x80\x99s name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: _physiques, chimiques et\r\nnaturelles_. Aha. Eating your groatsworth of _mou en civet_, fleshpots\r\nof Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural\r\ntone: when I was in Paris; _boul\xe2\x80\x99 Mich\xe2\x80\x99_, I used to. Yes, used to carry\r\npunched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder\r\nsomewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904\r\nthe prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me.\r\nHat, tie, overcoat, nose. _Lui, c\xe2\x80\x99est moi_. You seem to have enjoyed\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nProudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a\r\ndispossessed. With mother\xe2\x80\x99s money order, eight shillings, the banging\r\ndoor of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger\r\ntoothache. _Encore deux minutes_. Look clock. Must get. _Ferm\xc3\xa9_. Hired\r\ndog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered\r\nwalls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not\r\nhurt? O, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Shake a shake. O, that\xe2\x80\x99s all only all right.\r\n\r\nYou were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery\r\nColumbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt\r\nfrom their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: _Euge! Euge!_ Pretending to\r\nspeak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence,\r\nacross the slimy pier at Newhaven. _Comment?_ Rich booty you brought\r\nback; _Le Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte\r\nRouge_; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mother dying come home father.\r\n\r\nThe aunt thinks you killed your mother. That\xe2\x80\x99s why she won\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n     Then here\xe2\x80\x99s a health to Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s aunt\r\n     And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the reason why.\r\n     She always kept things decent in\r\n     The Hannigan famileye.\r\n\r\nHis feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by\r\nthe boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone\r\nmammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is\r\nthere, the slender trees, the lemon houses.\r\n\r\nParis rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of\r\nfarls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the\r\nair. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s lover\xe2\x80\x99s wife, the\r\nkerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In\r\nRodot\xe2\x80\x99s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering\r\nwith gold teeth _chaussons_ of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the\r\n_pus_ of _flan br\xc3\xa9ton_. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased\r\npleasers, curled conquistadores.\r\n\r\nNoon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers\r\nsmeared with printer\xe2\x80\x99s ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his\r\nwhite. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. _Un demi\r\ns\xc3\xa9tier!_ A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves\r\nme at his beck. _Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux\r\nirlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!_ She thought you wanted a\r\ncheese _hollandais_. Your postprandial, do you know that word?\r\nPostprandial. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer\r\nfellow, used to call it his postprandial. Well: _slainte!_ Around the\r\nslabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His\r\nbreath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy\xe2\x80\x99s fang\r\nthrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes,\r\nconspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of\r\nmen. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s son. I know the voice. His fustian shirt,\r\nsanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M.\r\nDrumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen\r\nVictoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. _Vieille ogresse_ with the\r\n_dents jaunes_. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, _La Patrie_, M. Millevoye,\r\nF\xc3\xa9lix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken, _bonne \xc3\xa0\r\ntout faire_, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala. _Moi\r\nfaire_, she said, _Tous les messieurs_. Not this _Monsieur_, I said.\r\nMost licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let my\r\nbrother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I\r\nsee you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.\r\n\r\nThe blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose\r\ntobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw\r\nfacebones under his peep of day boy\xe2\x80\x99s hat. How the head centre got\r\naway, authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil,\r\norangeblossoms, drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost\r\nleaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nSpurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her\r\nlove he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under\r\nthe walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl\r\nthem upward in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay\r\nParee he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the\r\nMontmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or,\r\ndamascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Loveless, landless,\r\nwifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in\r\nrue G\xc3\xaet-le-C\xc5\x93ur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra\r\nskirt, frisky as a young thing\xe2\x80\x99s. Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat\r\nyou saw me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time. _Mon\r\nfils_, soldier of France. I taught him to sing _The boys of Kilkenny\r\nare stout roaring blades_. Know that old lay? I taught Patrice that.\r\nOld Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow\xe2\x80\x99s castle on the Nore. Goes like\r\nthis. _O, O_. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.\r\n\r\n     O, O the boys of\r\n     Kilkenny...\r\n\r\nWeak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.\r\nRemembering thee, O Sion.\r\n\r\nHe had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.\r\nThe new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of\r\nseeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,\r\nam I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the\r\nquaking soil. Turn back.\r\n\r\nTurning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in\r\nnew sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the\r\nbarbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet\r\nare sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk,\r\nnightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,\r\ntheir pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned\r\nplatters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when\r\nthis night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind\r\nbodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted\r\nhis feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take\r\nall, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmidwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing\r\nElsinore\xe2\x80\x99s tempting flood.\r\n\r\nThe flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back\r\nthen by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge\r\nand eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a\r\ngrike.\r\n\r\nA bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the\r\ngunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. _Un coche ensabl\xc3\xa9_ Louis Veuillot\r\ncalled Gautier\xe2\x80\x99s prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind\r\nhave silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren\r\nof weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and\r\nstones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout\xe2\x80\x99s toys. Mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t get one bang\r\non the ear. I\xe2\x80\x99m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well\r\nboulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz\r\nodz an Iridzman.\r\n\r\nA point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.\r\nLord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be\r\nmaster of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From\r\nfarther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,\r\ntwo. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.\r\nPeekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?\r\n\r\nGalleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their\r\nbloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings,\r\ntorcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the\r\ncollar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,\r\nspouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework\r\ncity a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers\xe2\x80\x99 knives,\r\nrunning, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague\r\nand slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved\r\namong them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the\r\nspluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.\r\n\r\nThe dog\xe2\x80\x99s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I\r\njust simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. _Terribilia meditans_. A\r\nprimrose doublet, fortune\xe2\x80\x99s knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you\r\npining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The\r\nBruce\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,\r\nYork\xe2\x80\x99s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a\r\nday, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion\r\ncrowned. All kings\xe2\x80\x99 sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved\r\nmen from drowning and you shake at a cur\xe2\x80\x99s yelping. But the courtiers\r\nwho mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...\r\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what\r\nhe did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. _Nat\xc3\xbcrlich_, put there for\r\nyou. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago\r\noff Maiden\xe2\x80\x99s rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it\r\nout. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water\r\ncold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee! Who\xe2\x80\x99s behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing\r\nquickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,\r\nshellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life still\r\nto be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me\r\nout of horror of his death. I... With him together down... I could not\r\nsave her. Waters: bitter death: lost.\r\n\r\nA woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.\r\n\r\nTheir dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on\r\nall sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made\r\noff like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a\r\nlowskimming gull. The man\xe2\x80\x99s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He\r\nturned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a\r\nfield tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of\r\nthe tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout\r\nlifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented\r\ntowards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth,\r\nbreaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.\r\n\r\nCocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,\r\nsoused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped\r\nrunning to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again\r\nreared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them\r\nas they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf\xe2\x80\x99s tongue redpanting\r\nfrom his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped\r\noff at a calf\xe2\x80\x99s gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped,\r\nsniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,\r\nsniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog\xe2\x80\x99s bedraggled fell.\r\nDogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah,\r\npoor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody\xe2\x80\x99s body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!\r\n\r\nThe cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless\r\nkick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He\r\nslunk back in a curve. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he\r\nlolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed\r\nagainst it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed\r\nquick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His\r\nhindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.\r\nSomething he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand,\r\ndabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand\r\nagain with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in\r\nspousebreach, vulturing the dead.\r\n\r\nAfter he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.\r\nStreet of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That\r\nman led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against\r\nmy face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come.\r\nRed carpet spread. You will see who.\r\n\r\nShouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet\r\nout of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler\r\nstrangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the\r\nruffian and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand\r\nand shellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair\r\ntrailed. Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When\r\nnight hides her body\xe2\x80\x99s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an\r\narchway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal\r\nDublins in O\xe2\x80\x99Loughlin\xe2\x80\x99s of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues\xe2\x80\x99 rum\r\nlingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend\xe2\x80\x99s whiteness under her\r\nrancid rags. Fumbally\xe2\x80\x99s lane that night: the tanyard smells.\r\n\r\n     White thy fambles, red thy gan\r\n     And thy quarrons dainty is.\r\n     Couch a hogshead with me then.\r\n     In the darkmans clip and kiss.\r\n\r\nMorose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.\r\nUnfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: _thy quarrons\r\ndainty is_. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads\r\njabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nPassing now.\r\n\r\nA side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I\r\nam not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges,\r\nschlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering,\r\nmoondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not\r\nmine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon.\r\nIn sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed,\r\nchildbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. He\r\ncomes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying\r\nthe sea, mouth to her mouth\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\r\n\r\nHere. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.\r\nNo. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\r\n\r\nHis lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.\r\nOomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:\r\nooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring\r\nwayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.\r\nTurning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and\r\nscribbled words. That\xe2\x80\x99s twice I forgot to take slips from the library\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\nHis shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till\r\nthe farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness\r\nshining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there\r\nwith his augur\xe2\x80\x99s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid\r\nsea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth\r\nstars. I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it\r\nback. Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here?\r\nWho ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white\r\nfield. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of\r\nCloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space\r\nwith coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a\r\nflat: yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far,\r\nflat I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in\r\nstereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is\r\nin our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our\r\nsins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nShe trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue\r\nhell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality\r\nof the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at\r\nHodges Figgis\xe2\x80\x99 window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet\r\nbooks you were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through\r\nthe braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a\r\ngrief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else,\r\nStevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders\r\nand yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple\r\ndumplings, _piuttosto_. Where are your wits?\r\n\r\nTouch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me\r\nsoon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.\r\nSad too. Touch, touch me.\r\n\r\nHe lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the\r\nscribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his\r\neyes. That is Kevin Egan\xe2\x80\x99s movement I made, nodding for his nap,\r\nsabbath sleep. _Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona_. Alo! _Bonjour_.\r\nWelcome as the flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through\r\npeacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am caught in this burning\r\nscene. Pan\xe2\x80\x99s hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants,\r\nmilkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n     And no more turn aside and brood.\r\n\r\nHis gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck\xe2\x80\x99s castoffs,\r\n_nebeneinander_. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in\r\ntripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. _Tiens, quel petit pied!_\r\nStaunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s love that dare not speak its\r\nname. His arm: Cranly\xe2\x80\x99s arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I\r\nam. As I am. All or not at all.\r\n\r\nIn long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering\r\ngreengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float\r\naway. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the\r\nlow rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a\r\nfourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of\r\nwaters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it\r\nslops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech\r\nceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower\r\nunfurling.\r\n\r\nUnder the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and\r\nsway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water\r\nswaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:\r\nlifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,\r\nthey sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,\r\nawaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias\r\npatiens ingemiscit_. To no end gathered; vainly then released,\r\nforthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of\r\nlovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws\r\na toil of waters.\r\n\r\nFive fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he\r\nsaid. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a\r\nloose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse\r\nrising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise\r\nlandward. There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath\r\nthe watery floor. We have him. Easy now.\r\n\r\nBag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a\r\nspongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God\r\nbecomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed\r\nmountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a\r\nurinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes\r\nupward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nA seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths\r\nknown to man. Old Father Ocean. _Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.\r\nJust you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.\r\n\r\nCome. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?\r\nThunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,\r\n_Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_. No. My cockle hat and staff and\r\nhismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.\r\n\r\nHe took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying\r\nstill. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make\r\ntheir end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.\r\nOf all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn\r\nTennyson, gentleman poet. _Gi\xc3\xa0_. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.\r\nAnd Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. _Gi\xc3\xa0_. My teeth are very\r\nbad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to\r\na dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch,\r\nthe superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?\r\n\r\nMy handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?\r\n\r\nHis hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Better buy one.\r\n\r\nHe laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,\r\ncarefully. For the rest let look who will.\r\n\r\nBehind. Perhaps there is someone.\r\n\r\nHe turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the\r\nair high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the\r\ncrosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94 II \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 4 ]\r\n\r\nMr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.\r\nHe liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,\r\nliverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods\xe2\x80\x99 roes. Most of all he\r\nliked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of\r\nfaintly scented urine.\r\n\r\nKidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting\r\nher breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the\r\nkitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him\r\nfeel a bit peckish.\r\n\r\nThe coals were reddening.\r\n\r\nAnother slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nher plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off\r\nthe hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,\r\nits spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked\r\nstiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mkgnao!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.\r\n\r\nThe cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the\r\ntable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch\r\nmy head. Prr.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:\r\nthe gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her\r\ntail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Milk for the pussens, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrkgnao! the cat cried.\r\n\r\nThey call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we\r\nunderstand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.\r\nCruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder\r\nwhat I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the\r\nchookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.\r\n\r\nShe blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively\r\nand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits\r\nnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to\r\nthe dresser, took the jug Hanlon\xe2\x80\x99s milkman had just filled for him,\r\npoured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.\r\n\r\nHe watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped\r\nthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or\r\nkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.\r\n\r\nHe listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with\r\nthis drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for\r\na mutton kidney at Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.\r\nBetter a pork kidney at Dlugacz\xe2\x80\x99s. While the kettle is boiling. She\r\nlapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so\r\nrough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced\r\nround him. No.\r\n\r\nOn quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by\r\nthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter\r\nshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.\r\n\r\nHe said softly in the bare hall:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had heard his voice say it he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything for breakfast?\r\n\r\nA sleepy soft grunt answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mn.\r\n\r\nNo. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,\r\nas she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.\r\nMust get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.\r\nForgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for\r\nit. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor\xe2\x80\x99s auction.\r\nGot a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At\r\nPlevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of it. Still\r\nhe had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was\r\nfarseeing.\r\n\r\nHis hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat\r\nand his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback\r\npictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.\r\nThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White\r\nslip of paper. Quite safe.\r\n\r\nOn the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.\r\nIn the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky\r\nwardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He\r\npulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf\r\ndropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right\r\ntill I come back anyhow.\r\n\r\nHe crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number\r\nseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George\xe2\x80\x99s church. Be a\r\nwarm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black\r\nconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go in\r\nthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as\r\nhe walked in happy warmth. Boland\xe2\x80\x99s breadvan delivering with trays our\r\ndaily but she prefers yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\r\nMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at\r\ndawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day\xe2\x80\x99s march on him.\r\nKeep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a\r\nstrand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker\r\ntoo, old Tweedy\xe2\x80\x99s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.\r\nWander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of\r\ncarpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking\r\na coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented\r\nwith fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two.\r\nWell, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among\r\nthe pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees,\r\nsignal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches\r\nme from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark\r\nlanguage. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet,\r\ncolour of Molly\xe2\x80\x99s new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of\r\nthose instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.\r\n\r\nProbably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track\r\nof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.\r\nWhat Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_\r\nleader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway\r\nbehind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch\r\nthat: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.\r\n\r\nHe approached Larry O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s. From the cellar grating floated up the\r\nflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out\r\nwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the\r\nend of the city traffic. For instance M\xe2\x80\x99Auley\xe2\x80\x99s down there: n. g. as\r\nposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular\r\nfrom the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.\r\n\r\nBaldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an\r\nad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my\r\nbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching\r\nthe aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him\r\noff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ntell you? What\xe2\x80\x99s that, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d only be an eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock breakfast for the Japanese.\r\n\r\nStop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor\r\nDignam, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke.\r\n\r\nTurning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the\r\ndoorway:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lovely weather, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99Tis all that.\r\n\r\nWhere do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the\r\ncounty Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and\r\nbehold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think\r\nof the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin\r\nwithout passing a pub. Save it they can\xe2\x80\x99t. Off the drunks perhaps. Put\r\ndown three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs\r\nand drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with\r\nthe town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we\xe2\x80\x99ll split the\r\njob, see?\r\n\r\nHow much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels\r\nof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s National school. Brats\xe2\x80\x99 clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps\r\nmemory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee\r\ndoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At\r\ntheir joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.\r\n\r\nHe halted before Dlugacz\xe2\x80\x99s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,\r\npolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened\r\nin his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,\r\npacked with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the\r\nlukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs\xe2\x80\x99 blood.\r\n\r\nA kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He\r\nstood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too,\r\ncalling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a\r\npound and a half of Denny\xe2\x80\x99s sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous\r\nhips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New\r\nblood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on\r\nthe clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked\r\nskirt swings at each whack.\r\n\r\nThe ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with\r\nblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.\r\n\r\nHe took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at\r\nKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter\r\nsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round\r\nit, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:\r\nread it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page\r\nrustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the\r\nbeasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the\r\nbreeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a\r\npalm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there\xe2\x80\x99s a prime one, unpeeled\r\nswitches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his\r\nsenses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt\r\nswinging, whack by whack by whack.\r\n\r\nThe porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime\r\nsausages and made a red grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now, my miss, he said.\r\n\r\nShe tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went\r\nslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the\r\nmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood\r\noutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He\r\nsighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted\r\ntoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The\r\nsting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For\r\nanother: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles\xe2\x80\x99 Lane. They like\r\nthem sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I\xe2\x80\x99m lost in the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Threepence, please.\r\n\r\nHis hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.\r\nThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pocket and laid them\r\non the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,\r\ndisc by disc, into the till.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, sir. Another time.\r\n\r\nA speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze\r\nafter an instant. No: better not: another time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, he said, moving away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, sir.\r\n\r\nNo sign. Gone. What matter?\r\n\r\nHe walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:\r\nplanters\xe2\x80\x99 company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish\r\ngovernment and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel\r\nand construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.\r\nYou pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with\r\nolives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need\r\nartificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your\r\nname entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten\r\ndown and the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34,\r\nBerlin, W. 15.\r\n\r\nNothing doing. Still an idea behind it.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered\r\nolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in\r\njars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out.\r\nKnows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.\r\nCitrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s parade. And\r\nMastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in\r\nCitron\xe2\x80\x99s basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand,\r\nlift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet,\r\nwild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high\r\nprices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant\r\nold times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain,\r\nGibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside\r\nat Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them\r\nbarefoot in soiled dungarees. There\xe2\x80\x99s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do\r\nyou? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back\r\nis like that Norwegian captain\xe2\x80\x99s. Wonder if I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet him today.\r\nWatering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.\r\n\r\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.\r\n\r\nNo, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead\r\nsea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift\r\nthose waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called\r\nit raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All\r\ndead names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore\r\nthe oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nclutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far\r\naway over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying,\r\nbeing born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more.\r\nDead: an old woman\xe2\x80\x99s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.\r\n\r\nDesolation.\r\n\r\nGrey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he\r\nturned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his\r\nveins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I\r\nam here now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong\r\nside of the bed. Must begin again those Sandow\xe2\x80\x99s exercises. On the\r\nhands down. Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why\r\nis that? Valuation is only twentyeight. Towers, Battersby, North,\r\nMacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore\r\neye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling\r\nbutter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nQuick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim\r\nsandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a\r\ngirl with gold hair on the wind.\r\n\r\nTwo letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered\r\nthem. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.\r\nMrs Marion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poldy!\r\n\r\nEntering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm\r\nyellow twilight towards her tousled head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who are the letters for?\r\n\r\nHe looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And\r\na letter for you.\r\n\r\nHe laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of\r\nher knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you want the blind up?\r\n\r\nLetting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her\r\nglance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That do? he asked, turning.\r\n\r\nShe was reading the card, propped on her elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She got the things, she said.\r\n\r\nHe waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back\r\nslowly with a snug sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hurry up with that tea, she said. I\xe2\x80\x99m parched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The kettle is boiling, he said.\r\n\r\nBut he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled\r\nlinen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\nAs he went down the kitchen stairs she called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poldy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Scald the teapot.\r\n\r\nOn the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded\r\nand rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting\r\nthe kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took\r\noff the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the\r\nlump of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat\r\nmewed hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won\xe2\x80\x99t mouse. Say\r\nthey won\xe2\x80\x99t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall\r\nto her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper.\r\nHe sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.\r\n\r\nThen he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:\r\nnew tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseaside girls.\r\n\r\nThe tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,\r\nsmiling. Silly Milly\xe2\x80\x99s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait:\r\nfour. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of\r\nfolded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.\r\n\r\n     O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.\r\n     You are my lookingglass from night to morning.\r\n     I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have you without a farthing\r\n     Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.\r\n\r\nPoor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous\r\nold chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And\r\nthe little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the\r\nparlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin\xe2\x80\x99s hat! All we\r\nlaughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.\r\n\r\nHe prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the\r\nteapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?\r\nBread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it\r\nupstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.\r\n\r\nNudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it\r\non the chair by the bedhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What a time you were! she said.\r\n\r\nShe set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on\r\nthe pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large\r\nsoft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat\xe2\x80\x99s udder. The\r\nwarmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance\r\nof the tea she poured.\r\n\r\nA strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the\r\nact of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who was the letter from? he asked.\r\n\r\nBold hand. Marion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Boylan, she said. He\xe2\x80\x99s bringing the programme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you singing?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_L\xc3\xa0 ci darem_ with J. C. Doyle, she said, and _Love\xe2\x80\x99s Old Sweet Song_.\r\n\r\nHer full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves\r\nnext day. Like foul flowerwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Would you like the window open a little?\r\n\r\nShe doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What time is the funeral?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the paper.\r\n\r\nFollowing the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled\r\ndrawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a\r\nstocking: rumpled, shiny sole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No: that book.\r\n\r\nOther stocking. Her petticoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It must have fell down, she said.\r\n\r\nHe felt here and there. _Voglio e non vorrei_. Wonder if she pronounces\r\nthat right: _voglio_. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped\r\nand lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of\r\nthe orangekeyed chamberpot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There\xe2\x80\x99s a word I wanted to\r\nask you.\r\n\r\nShe swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,\r\nhaving wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the\r\ntext with the hairpin till she reached the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Met him what? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, she said. What does that mean?\r\n\r\nHe leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Metempsychosis?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Who\xe2\x80\x99s he when he\xe2\x80\x99s at home?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It\xe2\x80\x99s Greek: from the Greek. That\r\nmeans the transmigration of souls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.\r\nThe first night after the charades. Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn. He turned over the\r\nsmudged pages. _Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_. Hello. Illustration.\r\nFierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the\r\nfloor naked. Sheet kindly lent. _The monster Maffei desisted and flung\r\nhis victim from him with an oath_. Cruelty behind it all. Doped\r\nanimals. Trapeze at Hengler\xe2\x80\x99s. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping.\r\nBreak your neck and we\xe2\x80\x99ll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them\r\nyoung so they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s soul after he dies. Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s soul...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you finish it? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, she said. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the\r\nfirst fellow all the time?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never read it. Do you want another?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock\xe2\x80\x99s. Nice name he has.\r\n\r\nShe poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.\r\n\r\nMust get that Capel street library book renewed or they\xe2\x80\x99ll write to\r\nKearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that\xe2\x80\x99s the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body\r\nafter death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we\r\nall lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other\r\nplanet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their\r\npast lives.\r\n\r\nThe sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better\r\nremind her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An\r\nexample?\r\n\r\nThe _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed. Given away with the Easter number\r\nof _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you\r\nput milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six\r\nI gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked\r\nnymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.\r\n\r\nHe turned the pages back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They\r\nused to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for\r\ninstance. What they called nymphs, for example.\r\n\r\nHer spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,\r\ninhaling through her arched nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The kidney! he cried suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes\r\nagainst the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping\r\nhastily down the stairs with a flurried stork\xe2\x80\x99s legs. Pungent smoke\r\nshot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of\r\nthe fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its\r\nback. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and\r\nlet the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.\r\n\r\nCup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He\r\nshore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a\r\nforkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant\r\nmeat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of\r\nbread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that\r\nabout some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his\r\nside, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in\r\nthe gravy and raising it to his mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest Papli\r\n\r\nThanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me\r\nsplendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got\r\nmummy\xe2\x80\x99s lovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am\r\ngetting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of\r\nme and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair\r\nday and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel\r\non Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to\r\nmummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano\r\ndownstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.\r\nThere is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his\r\ncousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s (I was on the\r\npop of writing Blazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s) song about those seaside girls. Tell\r\nhim silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest\r\nlove\r\n\r\n                    Your fond daughter\r\n                        Milly\r\n\r\nP. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby.\r\n\r\n                        M.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first\r\nbirthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she\r\nwas born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly\r\nold woman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew\r\nfrom the first poor little Rudy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live. Well, God is good, sir.\r\nShe knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.\r\n\r\nHis vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.\r\nHurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the\r\nXL Caf\xc3\xa9 about the bracelet. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat her cakes or speak or look.\r\nSaucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece\r\nafter piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she\r\nmight do worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of\r\ncooler tea to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.\r\n\r\nO, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has\r\nhappened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild\r\npiece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny.\r\nRipening now. Vain: very.\r\n\r\nHe smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught\r\nher in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a\r\nlittle. Was given milk too long. On the _Erin\xe2\x80\x99s King_ that day round\r\nthe Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue\r\nscarf loose in the wind with her hair.\r\n\r\n     All dimpled cheeks and curls,\r\n     Your head it simply swirls.\r\n\r\nSeaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pockets,\r\njarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.\r\nPier with lamps, summer evening, band.\r\n\r\n     Those girls, those girls,\r\n     Those lovely seaside girls.\r\n\r\nMilly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.\r\nReading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,\r\nbraiding.\r\n\r\nA soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will\r\nhappen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can\xe2\x80\x99t move. Girl\xe2\x80\x99s sweet light lips.\r\nWill happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to\r\nmove now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\nBetter where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass\r\nthe time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two\r\nand six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or\r\nthrough M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\nThe cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,\r\nnosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.\r\nWants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her\r\nwait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her\r\near with her back to the fire too.\r\n\r\nHe felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood\r\nup, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\r\n\r\nHeaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nA paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m.\r\n\r\nIn the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_. He folded it\r\nunder his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in\r\nsoft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.\r\n\r\nListening, he heard her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, come, pussy. Come.\r\n\r\nHe went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen\r\ntowards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.\r\nThe maid was in the garden. Fine morning.\r\n\r\nHe bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.\r\nMake a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to\r\nmanure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.\r\nAll soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this\r\nthat is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top\r\ndressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are\r\nfed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies\xe2\x80\x99 kid\r\ngloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in\r\nthat corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still\r\ngardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.\r\n\r\nHe walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the\r\npeg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that. Hallstand\r\ntoo full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.\r\nDrago\xe2\x80\x99s shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown\r\nbrillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder\r\nhave I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox\r\nthere got away James Stephens, they say. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien.\r\n\r\nDeep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.\r\nEnthusiast.\r\n\r\nHe kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to\r\nget these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head\r\nunder the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy\r\nlimewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he\r\npeered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his\r\ncountinghouse. Nobody.\r\n\r\nAsquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over\r\non his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a\r\nbit. Our prize titbit: _Matcham\xe2\x80\x99s Masterstroke_. Written by Mr Philip\r\nBeaufoy, Playgoers\xe2\x80\x99 Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a\r\ncolumn has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds\r\nthree. Three pounds, thirteen and six.\r\n\r\nQuietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding\r\nbut resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding,\r\nhe allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading\r\nstill patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive.\r\nOne tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or\r\ntouch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now.\r\nSilly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat\r\ncertainly. _Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won\r\nthe laughing witch who now_. Begins and ends morally. _Hand in hand_.\r\nSmart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his\r\nwater flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and\r\nreceived payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.\r\n\r\nMight manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for\r\nsome proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what\r\nshe said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving.\r\nBiting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her.\r\n9.15. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23.\r\nWhat possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I\xe2\x80\x99m swelled after that\r\ncabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.\r\n\r\nRubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning\r\nafter the bazaar dance when May\xe2\x80\x99s band played Ponchielli\xe2\x80\x99s dance of the\r\nhours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then\r\nnight hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head\r\ndancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.\r\nWhy? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use\r\nhumming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The\r\nmirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen\r\nvest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.\r\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pan out somehow.\r\n\r\nEvening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with\r\ndaggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then\r\nblack. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.\r\n\r\nHe tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.\r\nThen he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled\r\nback the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nIn the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully\r\nhis black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What\r\ntime is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.\r\n\r\nA creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchurch. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.\r\n\r\n     Heigho! Heigho!\r\n     Heigho! Heigho!\r\n     Heigho! Heigho!\r\n\r\nQuarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air. A\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nPoor Dignam!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 5 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy lorries along sir John Rogerson\xe2\x80\x99s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past\r\nWindmill lane, Leask\xe2\x80\x99s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph\r\noffice. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors\xe2\x80\x99 home.\r\nHe turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through\r\nLime street. By Brady\xe2\x80\x99s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket\r\nof offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of\r\neczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered\r\ncaskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won\xe2\x80\x99t grow. O let him! His life\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come\r\nhome to ma, da. Slack hour: won\xe2\x80\x99t be many there. He crossed Townsend\r\nstreet, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph,\r\nBeth. And past Nichols\xe2\x80\x99 the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough.\r\nDaresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s. Singing with his\r\neyes shut. Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark.\r\nPolice tout. Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom\r\ntooraloom tay. O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a\r\nwhatyoumaycall. With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.\r\n\r\nIn Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental\r\nTea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,\r\nfinest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom\r\nKernan. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still\r\nread blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent\r\nhis right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm\r\nmorning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the\r\nleather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand\r\ncame down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card\r\nbehind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nSo warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and\r\nhair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice\r\nblend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it\r\nmust be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,\r\ncactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like\r\nthat. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,\r\nnot doing a hand\xe2\x80\x99s turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too\r\nhot to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of\r\nidleness. The air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens.\r\nSensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness\r\nin the air. Walk on roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and\r\ncowheel. Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in\r\nthe dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sink if you tried: so thick with salt. Because the weight of\r\nthe water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the\r\nweight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlaw something like that. Vance in High school cracking his\r\nfingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum.\r\nWhat is weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per\r\nsecond per second. Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They\r\nall fall to the ground. The earth. It\xe2\x80\x99s the force of gravity of the\r\nearth is the weight.\r\n\r\nHe turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her\r\nsausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded\r\n_Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a\r\nbaton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.\r\nCareless air: just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second\r\nfor every second it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance\r\nthrough the door of the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one.\r\nIn.\r\n\r\nHe handed the card through the brass grill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are there any letters for me? he asked.\r\n\r\nWhile the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting\r\nposter with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his\r\nbaton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer\r\nprobably. Went too far last time.\r\n\r\nThe postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a\r\nletter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.\r\n\r\nHenry Flower Esq,\r\nc/o P. O. Westland Row,\r\n            City.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,\r\nreviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where\xe2\x80\x99s old Tweedy\xe2\x80\x99s regiment?\r\nCastoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngrenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.\r\nRedcoats. Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform.\r\nEasier to enlist and drill. Maud Gonne\xe2\x80\x99s letter about taking them off\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npaper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease:\r\noverseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like.\r\nEyes front. Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King\xe2\x80\x99s own. Never see\r\nhim dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if\r\nthat would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger\r\nfelt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.\r\nWomen will pay a lot of heed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think. His fingers drew forth the\r\nletter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something\r\npinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy. Nowhere in particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x99s the body?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine. How are you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just keeping alive, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said.\r\n\r\nHis eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you\xe2\x80\x99re...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?\r\n\r\nA photo it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. A badge maybe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I must try to get out there, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard\r\nit last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door\r\nof the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She\r\nstood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,\r\nsearched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll\r\ncollar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless\r\nstand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty\r\ncreature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the\r\nspot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The\r\nhonourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take\r\nthe starch out of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was with Bob Doran, he\xe2\x80\x99s on one of his periodical bends, and what do\r\nyou call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway\xe2\x80\x99s we were.\r\n\r\nDoran Lyons in Conway\xe2\x80\x99s. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came\r\nHoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath\r\nhis vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the\r\nbraided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight\r\nperhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Which side will\r\nshe get up?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I\r\nsaid. _Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.\r\n\r\nOff to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces\r\ndangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?\r\nSees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two\r\nstrings to her bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Why?_ I said. _What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him?_ I said.\r\n\r\nProud: rich: silk stockings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe moved a little to the side of M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s talking head. Getting up in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him_? He said. _He\xe2\x80\x99s dead_, he said. And, faith, he\r\nfilled up. _Is it Paddy Dignam_? I said. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it when I\r\nheard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it\r\nin the Arch. _Yes,_ he said. _He\xe2\x80\x99s gone. He died on Monday, poor\r\nfellow_.\r\n\r\nWatch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!\r\n\r\nA heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.\r\n\r\nLost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and\r\nthe peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace\r\nstreet hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering\r\nthe display of. _Esprit de corps_. Well, what are you gaping at?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One of the best, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said.\r\n\r\nThe tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich\r\ngloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her\r\nhat in the sun: flicker, flick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wife well, I suppose? M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s changed voice said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.\r\n\r\nHe unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:\r\n\r\n     What is home without\r\n     Plumtree\xe2\x80\x99s Potted Meat?\r\n     Incomplete.\r\n     With it an abode of bliss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My missus has just got an engagement. At least it\xe2\x80\x99s not settled yet.\r\n\r\nValise tack again. By the way no harm. I\xe2\x80\x99m off that, thanks.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My wife too, he said. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to sing at a swagger affair in the\r\nUlster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That so? M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who\xe2\x80\x99s getting it up?\r\n\r\nMrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread\r\nand. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.\r\nDark lady and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n     Love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n     Old\r\n     Sweet\r\n     Song\r\n     Comes lo-ove\xe2\x80\x99s old...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of a tour, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.\r\n_Sweeeet song_. There\xe2\x80\x99s a committee formed. Part shares and part\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, well, he said. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news.\r\n\r\nHe moved to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell you what, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,\r\nwill you? I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go but I mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be able, you see. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndrowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself\r\nwould have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name\r\nif I\xe2\x80\x99m not there, will you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I\xe2\x80\x99d go if I possibly\r\ncould. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M\xe2\x80\x99Coy will do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped\r\ncorners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him\r\nhis for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings\r\nof it from that good day to this.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has\r\njust got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in\r\nits way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow: in the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t he hear the difference? Think he\xe2\x80\x99s that way inclined a bit.\r\nAgainst my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope\r\nthat smallpox up there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get worse. Suppose she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nherself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.\r\n\r\nWonder is he pimping after me?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured\r\nhoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane\xe2\x80\x99s Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSummer Sale. No, he\xe2\x80\x99s going on straight. Hello. _Leah_ tonight. Mrs\r\nBandmann Palmer. Like to see her again in that. _Hamlet_ she played\r\nlast night. Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia\r\ncommitted suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in\r\nthat. Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.\r\nYear before I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What\r\nis this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The\r\nscene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham\r\nrecognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.\r\n\r\nNathan\xe2\x80\x99s voice! His son\xe2\x80\x99s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left\r\nhis father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of\r\nhis father and left the God of his father.\r\n\r\nEvery word is so deep, Leopold.\r\n\r\nPoor papa! Poor man! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the room to look at his\r\nface. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the\r\nhazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t met\r\nthat M\xe2\x80\x99Coy fellow.\r\n\r\nHe came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently\r\nchamping teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid\r\nthe sweet oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn\r\nall they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in\r\nnosebags. Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and\r\ntheir doss. Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp\r\nbetween their haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor\r\nbrutes they look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.\r\n\r\nHe drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he\r\ncarried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.\r\n\r\nHe passed the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.\r\nAll weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.\r\n_Voglio e non_. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a\r\nfew flying syllables as they pass. He hummed:\r\n\r\n     L\xc3\xa0 ci darem la mano\r\n     La la lala la la.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in\r\nthe lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade\xe2\x80\x99s timberyard. Piled balks.\r\nRuins and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch\r\ncourt with its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard\r\na squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.\r\nA wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to\r\ndisturb them. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.\r\nOpen it. And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nschool. She liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis\xe2\x80\x99s. And Mr? He opened the letter\r\nwithin the newspaper.\r\n\r\nA flower. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not\r\nannoyed then? What does she say?\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Henry\r\n\r\nI got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry\r\nyou did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am\r\nawfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called\r\nyou naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me\r\nwhat is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home\r\nyou poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.\r\nPlease tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the\r\nbeautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you\r\nso often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a\r\nman as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell\r\nme more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what\r\nI will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to\r\nmeet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are\r\nexhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I\r\nhave such a bad headache. today. and write _by return_ to your longing\r\n\r\nMartha\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell\r\nand placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it\r\nbecause no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then\r\nwalking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and\r\nthere a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your\r\ncactus if you don\xe2\x80\x99t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear\r\nroses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfume. Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it\r\nback in his sidepocket.\r\n\r\nWeak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did\r\nshe wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like\r\nme, respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.\r\nThank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round\r\ncorners. Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic.\r\nGo further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.\r\nBrutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.\r\n\r\nFingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.\r\nCommon pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:\r\npinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses\r\nwithout thorns.\r\n\r\nFlat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in\r\nthe Coombe, linked together in the rain.\r\n\r\n     O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.\r\n     She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do\r\n     To keep it up,\r\n     To keep it up.\r\n\r\nIt? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all\r\nday typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your\r\nwife use. Now could you make out a thing like that?\r\n\r\n     To keep it up.\r\n\r\nMartha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or\r\nfaked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious.\r\nAlso the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.\r\n\r\n     To keep it up.\r\n\r\nNice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:\r\nquiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have\r\nbeen, strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the\r\nsupper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like\r\nthe hole in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I\r\ngo to the trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell\r\nher: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.\r\n\r\nGoing under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly\r\nin shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered\r\naway, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.\r\n\r\nHenry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the\r\nsame way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure\r\ncheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be\r\nmade out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change\r\nhis shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A\r\nmillion pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,\r\neightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of\r\nporter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen\r\nmillions of barrels of porter.\r\n\r\nWhat am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nAn incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.\r\nBarrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The\r\nbungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing\r\ntogether, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy\r\npooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the\r\nporch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it\r\nagain behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy for a pass to Mullingar.\r\n\r\nSame notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S. J.\r\non saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the\r\nconversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.\r\nThe protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the\r\ntrue religion. Save China\xe2\x80\x99s millions. Wonder how they explain it to the\r\nheathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for\r\nthem. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy\r\nwith hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo.\r\nCrown of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.\r\nChopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.\r\nSorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of\r\nthat Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99re taught that.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to\r\nbaptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.\r\nLike to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,\r\nlistening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThe cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,\r\npushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.\r\n\r\nSomething going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place\r\nto be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow\r\nmusic. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the\r\nbenches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch\r\nknelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,\r\nholding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a\r\ncommunion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it\r\nneatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her\r\nhat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent\r\ndown to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next\r\none. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? _Corpus:_ body. Corpse.\r\nGood idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a\r\ncorpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.\r\n\r\nHe stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by\r\none, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in\r\nits corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.\r\nWe ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here\r\nand there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for\r\nit to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nsort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes\r\nthem feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it\xe2\x80\x99s called.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you\r\nfeel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one\r\nfamily party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit\r\nspreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes\r\ncure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.\r\nOld fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind\r\nfaith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\nHe saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an\r\ninstant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace\r\naffair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nto do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.\r\nMolly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have\r\nsuffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.\r\n\r\nMeet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with\r\na veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here\r\nwith a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the\r\nsly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen\xe2\x80\x99s evidence on the\r\ninvincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion\r\nevery morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I\r\nam thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six\r\nchildren at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those\r\ncrawthumpers, now that\xe2\x80\x99s a good name for them, there\xe2\x80\x99s always something\r\nshiftylooking about them. They\xe2\x80\x99re not straight men of business either.\r\nO, no, she\xe2\x80\x99s not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up\r\nthat envelope? Yes: under the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs\r\nsmartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank\r\nwhat they are used to Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s porter or some temperance beverage\r\nWheatley\xe2\x80\x99s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane\xe2\x80\x99s ginger ale\r\n(aromatic). Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.\r\nCold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they\xe2\x80\x99d have one\r\nold booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer\r\nthe whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.\r\nPity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make\r\nthat instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he\r\nhad in Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat\r\nMater_ of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan\xe2\x80\x99s sermon first. Christ or\r\nPilate? Christ, but don\xe2\x80\x99t keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.\r\nFootdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice\r\nagainst that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the\r\npeople looking up:\r\n\r\n_Quis est homo._\r\n\r\nSome of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.\r\nMozart\xe2\x80\x99s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that. Those old popes keen on music,\r\non art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example\r\ntoo. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting,\r\nregular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse.\r\nStill, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.\r\nWhat kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own\r\nstrong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything after.\r\nKind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? Gluttons,\r\ntall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.\r\n\r\nHe saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and\r\nbless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom\r\nglanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand\r\nup at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again\r\nand he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the\r\naltar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered\r\neach other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a\r\ncard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O God, our refuge and our strength...\r\n\r\nMr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them\r\nthe bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious\r\nand immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More\r\ninteresting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful\r\norganisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants\r\nto. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon\r\nin their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I\r\nschschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look\r\ndown at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears.\r\nHusband learn to his surprise. God\xe2\x80\x99s little joke. Then out she comes.\r\nRepentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy\r\nMary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation\r\narmy blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.\r\nHow I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they\r\nwork the whole show. And don\xe2\x80\x99t they rake in the money too? Bequests\r\nalso: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses\r\nfor the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.\r\nMonasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the\r\nwitnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.\r\nLiberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of\r\nthe church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.\r\n\r\nThe priest prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our\r\nsafeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God\r\nrestrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly\r\nhost, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those\r\nother wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nThe priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women\r\nremained behind: thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nBetter be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate\r\nperhaps. Pay your Easter duty.\r\n\r\nHe stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the\r\ntime? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\n(whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.\r\nGlimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me\r\nbefore. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t farther south.\r\nHe passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the\r\nmain door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black\r\nmarble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive\r\nhands in the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice because I\xe2\x80\x99m in mourning myself.\r\nHe covered himself. How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet.\r\nBetter get that lotion made up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time.\r\nSweny\xe2\x80\x99s in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold\r\nbeaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long\xe2\x80\x99s, founded in the year of\r\nthe flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit some day.\r\n\r\nHe walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other\r\ntrousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.\r\nO well, poor fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s not his fault. When was it I got it made up\r\nlast? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it\r\nmust have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nThe chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he\r\nseems to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstone. The alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy\r\nthen. Why? Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your\r\ncharacter. Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.\r\nAll his alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te\r\nVirid. Smell almost cure you like the dentist\xe2\x80\x99s doorbell. Doctor Whack.\r\nHe ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first\r\nfellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples.\r\nWant to be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns\r\nblue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping\r\ndraughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the\r\npores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least\r\nexpect it. Clever of nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94About a fortnight ago, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the\r\ndusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling\r\nyour aches and pains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then\r\norangeflower water...\r\n\r\nIt certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And white wax also, he said.\r\n\r\nBrings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her\r\neyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my\r\ncuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the\r\nteeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.\r\nSkinfood. One of the old queen\xe2\x80\x99s sons, duke of Albany was it? had only\r\none skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to\r\nmake it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your?\r\n_Peau d\xe2\x80\x99Espagne_. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these\r\nsoaps have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner.\r\nHammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a\r\nnice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious\r\nlonging I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time\r\nfor massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a\r\nbottle?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call later in the day and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fourpence, sir.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you\r\ncome back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the\r\ncoolwrappered soap in his left hand.\r\n\r\nAt his armpit Bantam Lyons\xe2\x80\x99 voice and hand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bloom. What\xe2\x80\x99s the best news? Is that today\xe2\x80\x99s? Show us a minute.\r\n\r\nShaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look\r\nyounger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.\r\n\r\nBantam Lyons\xe2\x80\x99s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a\r\nwash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsoap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I want to see about that French horse that\xe2\x80\x99s running today, Bantam\r\nLyons said. Where the bugger is it?\r\n\r\nHe rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.\r\nBarber\xe2\x80\x99s itch. Tight collar he\xe2\x80\x99ll lose his hair. Better leave him the\r\npaper and get shut of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nBantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? his sharp voice said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\nBantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread\r\nsheets back on Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.\r\n\r\nHe sped off towards Conway\xe2\x80\x99s corner. God speed scut.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap\r\nin it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it\r\nlately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large\r\ntender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming\r\nembezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now.\r\nThey never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.\r\n\r\nHe walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a\r\nmosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He\r\neyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist\r\ndoubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it\r\nround like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the\r\nhub big: college. Something to catch the eye.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s Hornblower standing at the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge. Keep him on hands:\r\nmight take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower?\r\nHow do you do, sir?\r\n\r\nHeavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.\r\nSit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can\xe2\x80\x99t play it\r\nhere. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the\r\nKildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in\r\ntheir line. And the skulls we were acracking when M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy took the\r\nfloor. Heatwave. Won\xe2\x80\x99t last. Always passing, the stream of life, which\r\nin the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.\r\n\r\nEnjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid\r\nstream. This is my body.\r\n\r\nHe foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of\r\nwarmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk\r\nand limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,\r\nlemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of\r\nhis bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father\r\nof thousands, a languid floating flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 6 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking\r\ncarriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in\r\nafter him, curving his height with care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After you, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to\r\nafter him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm\r\nthrough the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow\r\nat the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman\r\npeeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she\r\nwas passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad\r\nto see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.\r\nHuggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming\r\nmaking the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know\r\nwho will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the\r\nnails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same\r\nafter. Unclean job.\r\n\r\nAll waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am\r\nsitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better\r\nshift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.\r\n\r\nAll waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:\r\nthen horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and\r\nswaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of\r\nthe avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.\r\nAt walking pace.\r\n\r\nThey waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were\r\npassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels\r\nrattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook\r\nrattling in the doorframes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus nodded, looking out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAll watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by\r\npassers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the\r\nsmoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,\r\nclad in mourning, a wide hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your son and heir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.\r\n\r\nThe carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway\r\nbefore the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back\r\nto the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus\r\nfell back, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding\r\nfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa\xe2\x80\x99s little lump\r\nof dung, the wise child that knows her own father.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the\r\nbottleworks: Dodder bridge.\r\n\r\nRichie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls\r\nthe firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing\r\nin Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x99s two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.\r\nBeginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife\r\nironing his back. Thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they\r\nare. About six hundred per cent profit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a\r\ncontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks\r\nall over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother\r\nor his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a\r\ngate. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.\r\n\r\nHe cried above the clatter of the wheels:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M\xe2\x80\x99Swiney\xe2\x80\x99s. Not likely.\r\n\r\nHe ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s mild\r\nface and Martin Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy\r\nselfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If\r\nlittle Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.\r\nWalking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange\r\nfeeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that\r\nmorning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs\r\nat it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning\r\nup. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us\r\na touch, Poldy. God, I\xe2\x80\x99m dying for it. How life begins.\r\n\r\nGot big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.\r\nI could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.\r\nLearn German too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are we late? Mr Power asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\nMolly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping\r\nJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she\xe2\x80\x99s a dear girl. Soon be a\r\nwoman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.\r\nLife, life.\r\n\r\nThe carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t that squint troubling him. Do\r\nyou follow me?\r\n\r\nHe closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away\r\ncrustcrumbs from under his thighs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAll raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless\r\nleather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Unless I\xe2\x80\x99m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite\r\nclean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus sighed resignedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After all, he said, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of\r\nhis beard gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He\xe2\x80\x99s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I met M\xe2\x80\x99Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d try to come.\r\n\r\nThe carriage halted short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99re stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where are we?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom put his head out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The grand canal, he said.\r\n\r\nGasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got\r\nit. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame\r\nreally. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed\r\ntea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don\xe2\x80\x99t miss\r\nthis chance. Dogs\xe2\x80\x99 home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,\r\nLeopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.\r\nA dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndogs usually are.\r\n\r\nA raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower\r\nspray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a\r\ncolander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The weather is changing, he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There\xe2\x80\x99s the sun again coming\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled\r\na mute curse at the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s as uncertain as a child\xe2\x80\x99s bottom, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99re off again.\r\n\r\nThe carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed\r\ngently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking\r\nhim off to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear\r\nhim, Simon, on Ben Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple\r\nballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the\r\nwhole course of my experience._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead nuts on that. And the\r\nretrospective arrangement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you read Dan Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the paper this morning.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the\r\ndeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what\r\nPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne\xe2\x80\x99s? no, Sexton,\r\nUrbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.\r\nThanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief\r\nof his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month\xe2\x80\x99s mind:\r\nQuinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.\r\n\r\n     It is now a month since dear Henry fled\r\n     To his home up above in the sky\r\n     While his family weeps and mourns his loss\r\n     Hoping some day to meet him on high.\r\n\r\nI tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it\r\nin the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry\r\nfled. Before my patience are exhausted.\r\n\r\nNational school. Meade\xe2\x80\x99s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.\r\nFull as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round\r\nwith a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their\r\nhats.\r\n\r\nA pointsman\xe2\x80\x99s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a\r\ntramway standard by Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s window. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they invent something\r\nautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow\r\nwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job\r\nmaking the new invention?\r\n\r\nAntient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a\r\ncrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\nThey went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark\xe2\x80\x99s, under the railway\r\nbridge, past the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene\r\nStratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I\r\nwonder. I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_? Elster Grimes Opera\r\nCompany. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. _Fun on\r\nthe Bristol_. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have\r\nto stand a drink or two. As broad as it\xe2\x80\x99s long.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.\r\n\r\nPlasto\xe2\x80\x99s. Sir Philip Crampton\xe2\x80\x99s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? Mr Dedalus asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.\r\n\r\nJust that moment I was thinking.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the\r\nwhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right\r\nhand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?\r\nFascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes\r\nfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am\r\njust looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body\r\ngetting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes\r\nthat? I suppose the skin can\xe2\x80\x99t contract quickly enough when the flesh\r\nfalls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.\r\nHips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the\r\ncheeks behind.\r\n\r\nHe clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant\r\nglance over their faces.\r\n\r\nMr Power asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nidea, you see...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going yourself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the\r\ncounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the\r\nchief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.\r\n\r\nHave you good artists?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have all\r\ntopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and\r\nclasped them. Smith O\xe2\x80\x99Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.\r\nWoman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage\r\nwheeling by Farrell\xe2\x80\x99s statue united noiselessly their unresisting\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nOot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his\r\nmouth opening: oot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Four bootlaces for a penny.\r\n\r\nWonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.\r\nSame house as Molly\xe2\x80\x99s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.\r\nHas that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.\r\nTerrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan on his last legs.\r\n\r\nAnd _Madame_. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing\r\nher hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_. No: _vorrei e non_. Looking\r\nat the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. _Mi trema un poco\r\nil_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A\r\nthrostle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.\r\n\r\nHis eyes passed lightly over Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s goodlooking face. Greyish over\r\nthe ears. _Madame_: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.\r\nOnly politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the\r\nwoman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it\r\ntold me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played\r\nout pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her\r\na pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury\xe2\x80\x99s. Or the\r\nMoira, was it?\r\n\r\nThey passed under the hugecloaked Liberator\xe2\x80\x99s form.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.\r\n\r\nA tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner\r\nof Elvery\xe2\x80\x99s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his\r\nspine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The devil break the hasp of your back!\r\n\r\nMr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as\r\nthe carriage passed Gray\xe2\x80\x99s statue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.\r\n\r\nHis eyes met Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, nearly all of us.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions\xe2\x80\x99 faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully good one that\xe2\x80\x99s going the rounds about Reuben J and\r\nthe son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94About the boatman? Mr Power asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it awfully good?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to\r\nsend him to the Isle of Man out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way but when they were\r\nboth.....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried\r\nto drown.....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!\r\n\r\nMr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on\r\ntheir way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got\r\nloose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished\r\nhim out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father\r\non the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for\r\nsaving his son\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nA stifled sigh came from under Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.\r\n\r\nMr Power\xe2\x80\x99s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.\r\n\r\nNelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t grudge us a laugh.\r\nMany a good one he told himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his\r\nfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last\r\nand he was in his usual health that I\xe2\x80\x99d be driving after him like this.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone from us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went\r\nvery suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.\r\n\r\nHe tapped his chest sadly.\r\n\r\nBlazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.\r\nDrink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent\r\ncolouring it.\r\n\r\nMr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The best death, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nTheir wide open eyes looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.\r\n\r\nNo-one spoke.\r\n\r\nDead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,\r\ntemperance hotel, Falconer\xe2\x80\x99s railway guide, civil service college,\r\nGill\xe2\x80\x99s, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or\r\nwind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the\r\nlate Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.\r\n\r\nWhite horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,\r\ngalloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning\r\ncoach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for\r\na nun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.\r\n\r\nA dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy\xe2\x80\x99s was. Dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbody, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society\r\npays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant\r\nnothing. Mistake of nature. If it\xe2\x80\x99s healthy it\xe2\x80\x99s from the mother. If\r\nnot from the man. Better luck next time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It\xe2\x80\x99s well out of it.\r\n\r\nThe carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his\r\nbones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We\r\nmust take a charitable view of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.\r\nLike Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy\r\non that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to\r\ndrive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbroken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the\r\nriverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of\r\na wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then\r\npawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the\r\nlife of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday\r\nmorning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have\r\nlooked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about\r\nthe place and capering with Martin\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella.\r\n\r\n     And they call me the jewel of Asia,\r\n     Of Asia,\r\n     The geisha.\r\n\r\nHe looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The\r\nroom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight\r\nthrough the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner\xe2\x80\x99s sunlit ears, big\r\nand hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw\r\nlike yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the\r\nbed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son\r\nLeopold.\r\n\r\nNo more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.\r\n\r\nThe carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God grant he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow\r\nin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.\r\n\r\nAs they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent\r\nover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has\r\nanybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from _Saul._\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The\r\n_Mater Misericordiae_. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place.\r\nWard for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady\xe2\x80\x99s Hospice for the\r\ndying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They\r\nlook terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the\r\nspoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student\r\nthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone over to the\r\nlying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.\r\n\r\nThe carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong now?\r\n\r\nA divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching\r\nby on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony\r\ncroups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Emigrants, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Huuuh! the drover\xe2\x80\x99s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.\r\nHuuuh! out of that!\r\n\r\nThursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold\r\nthem about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for\r\nold England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter\r\nlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a\r\nyear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,\r\nsoap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off\r\nthe train at Clonsilla.\r\n\r\nThe carriage moved on through the drove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out why the corporation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run a tramline from the\r\nparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken\r\nin trucks down to the boats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite\r\nright. They ought to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have\r\nmunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line\r\nout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage\r\nand all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what I mean?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon\r\ndiningroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be more decent\r\nthan galloping two abreast?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have scenes like that when\r\nthe hearse capsized round Dunphy\xe2\x80\x99s and upset the coffin on to the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That was terrible, Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s shocked face said, and the corpse fell\r\nabout the road. Terrible!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94First round Dunphy\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.\r\n\r\nBom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy\r\nDignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too\r\nlarge for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what\xe2\x80\x99s up\r\nnow. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides\r\ndecompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.\r\nWith wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dunphy\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.\r\n\r\nDunphy\xe2\x80\x99s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A\r\npause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll pull up\r\nhere on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.\r\nElixir of life.\r\n\r\nBut suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in\r\nthe knocking about? He would and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I suppose. Depends on\r\nwhere. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery.\r\nIt would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.\r\n\r\nIn silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted\r\nby, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.\r\n\r\nCrossguns bridge: the royal canal.\r\n\r\nWater rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping\r\nbarge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a\r\nslacktethered horse. Aboard of the _Bugabu._\r\n\r\nTheir eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on\r\nhis raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of\r\nreeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,\r\nMoyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or\r\ncycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at\r\nthe auction but a lady\xe2\x80\x99s. Developing waterways. James M\xe2\x80\x99Cann\xe2\x80\x99s hobby to\r\nrow me o\xe2\x80\x99er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.\r\nCamping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without\r\nwriting. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by\r\nlock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his\r\nbrown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.\r\n\r\nThey drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.\r\n\r\nThe carriage steered left for Finglas road.\r\n\r\nThe stonecutter\xe2\x80\x99s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of\r\nland silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,\r\nknelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:\r\nappealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder\r\nand sculptor.\r\n\r\nPassed.\r\n\r\nOn the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s, an old tramp sat,\r\ngrumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown\r\nyawning boot. After life\xe2\x80\x99s journey.\r\n\r\nGloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.\r\n\r\nMr Power pointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.\r\nMurdered his brother. Or so they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That\xe2\x80\x99s the maxim of the\r\nlaw. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent\r\nperson to be wrongfully condemned.\r\n\r\nThey looked. Murderer\xe2\x80\x99s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,\r\ntenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully\r\ncondemned. Murder. The murderer\xe2\x80\x99s image in the eye of the murdered.\r\nThey love reading about it. Man\xe2\x80\x99s head found in a garden. Her clothing\r\nconsisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.\r\nMurderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.\r\nMurder will out.\r\n\r\nCramped in this carriage. She mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like me to come that way without\r\nletting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with\r\ntheir pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.\r\n\r\nThe high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,\r\nrare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the\r\ntrees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain\r\ngestures on the air.\r\n\r\nThe felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put\r\nout his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with\r\nhis knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.\r\n\r\nChange that soap now. Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly\r\nand transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.\r\nHe stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand\r\nstill held.\r\n\r\nPaltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same.\r\nPallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.\r\nBeyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and\r\nfruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.\r\nDogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.\r\n\r\nHe followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes\r\nwalking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took\r\nout the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.\r\n\r\nWhere is that child\xe2\x80\x99s funeral disappeared to?\r\n\r\nA team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,\r\ndragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a\r\ngranite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.\r\n\r\nCoffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at\r\nit with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,\r\npressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out\r\nhere every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount\r\nJerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere\r\nevery minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.\r\nThousands every hour. Too many in the world.\r\n\r\nMourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,\r\nhard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl\xe2\x80\x99s face stained with dirt\r\nand tears, holding the woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm, looking up at her for a sign to\r\ncry. Fish\xe2\x80\x99s face, bloodless and livid.\r\n\r\nThe mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So\r\nmuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First\r\nthe stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy\r\nfollowed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\nAll walked after.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Power whispered. How so?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.\r\nAnniversary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?\r\n\r\nHe glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed\r\ntowards the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s mausoleum. Speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily\r\nmortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How many children did he leave?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Five. Ned Lambert says he\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get one of the girls into Todd\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.\r\n\r\nHas the laugh at him now.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had\r\noutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must\r\noutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the\r\nworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon follow\r\nhim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who\r\nknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on\r\na guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in\r\nthe end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of\r\nhearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the\r\nsubstance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,\r\nwaiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground:\r\nand lie no more in her warm bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen you for a month of Sundays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never better. How are all in Cork\xe2\x80\x99s own town?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert\r\nsaid. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And how is Dick, the solid man?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,\r\npointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the\r\ninsurance is cleared up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother. John Henry Menton is\r\nbehind. He put down his name for a quid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought\r\nto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Many a good man\xe2\x80\x99s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThey halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood\r\nbehind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and\r\nat the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was\r\nhe there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last\r\nmoment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe\r\nthree shillings to O\xe2\x80\x99Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the\r\ncoffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened\r\nlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow\r\ncandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a\r\nwreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners\r\nknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the\r\nfont and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper\r\nfrom his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black\r\nhat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.\r\n\r\nA server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a\r\ndoor. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with\r\none hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbelly. Who\xe2\x80\x99ll read the book? I, said the rook.\r\n\r\nThey halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book\r\nwith a fluent croak.\r\n\r\nFather Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. _Dominenamine._ Bully\r\nabout the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe\r\nbetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst\r\nsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on\r\nhim like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:\r\nburst sideways.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._\r\n\r\nMakes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem\r\nmass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.\r\nChilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning\r\nin the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a\r\ntoad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after\r\ncabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an\r\ninfernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they\r\nget like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the\r\nvaults of saint Werburgh\xe2\x80\x99s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have\r\nto bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn\r\nit. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you\xe2\x80\x99re a goner.\r\n\r\nMy kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That\xe2\x80\x99s better.\r\n\r\nThe priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end\r\nand shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As\r\nyou were before you rested. It\xe2\x80\x99s all written down: he has to do it.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._\r\n\r\nThe server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be\r\nbetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course\r\n...\r\n\r\nHoly water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed\r\nup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.\r\nWhat harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day\r\na fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in\r\nchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls\r\nwith little sparrows\xe2\x80\x99 breasts. All the year round he prayed the same\r\nthing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94In paradisum._\r\n\r\nSaid he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over\r\neverybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.\r\n\r\nThe priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny\r\nKelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the\r\ncoffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny\r\nKelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All\r\nfollowed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom\r\ncame last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at\r\nthe ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal\r\nwheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt\r\nboots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.\r\n\r\nThe ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t lilt here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The O\xe2\x80\x99Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.\r\n\r\nMr Power\xe2\x80\x99s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O\xe2\x80\x99. But\r\nhis heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here,\r\nSimon!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be stretched\r\nbeside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.\r\n\r\nBreaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little\r\nin his walk. Mr Power took his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She\xe2\x80\x99s better where she is, he said kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in\r\nheaven if there is a heaven.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to\r\nplod by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can\r\ndo so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.\r\n\r\nThey covered their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\r\nMr Kernan said with reproof.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret\r\neyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We\r\nare the last. In the same boat. Hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll say something else.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more\r\nimpressive I must say.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan said with solemnity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_I am the resurrection and the life_. That touches a man\xe2\x80\x99s inmost\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It does, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nYour heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two\r\nwith his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.\r\nBroken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood\r\nevery day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of\r\nthem lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn\r\nthe thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you\r\nare dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves.\r\nCome forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last\r\nday! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and\r\nthe rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning.\r\nPennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher fell into step at their side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Everything went off A1, he said. What?\r\n\r\nHe looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. With\r\nyour tooraloom tooraloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As it should be, Mr Kernan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan assured him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I\r\nknow his face.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert glanced back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the\r\nsoprano. She\xe2\x80\x99s his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her for some\r\ntime. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen\r\nseventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s in Roundtown. And a good\r\narmful she was.\r\n\r\nHe looked behind through the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he in the stationery\r\nline? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s. A traveller for blottingpaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In God\xe2\x80\x99s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like\r\nthat for? She had plenty of game in her then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton\xe2\x80\x99s large eyes stared ahead.\r\n\r\nThe barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the\r\ngrasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94John O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am come to pay you another visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nyour custom at all.\r\n\r\nSaluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin\r\nCunningham\xe2\x80\x99s side puzzling two long keys at his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I did not, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nThey bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The\r\ncaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke\r\nin a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy\r\nevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for\r\nMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After\r\ntraipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the\r\ndrunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was\r\nblinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like\r\nthe man_, says he. _That\xe2\x80\x99s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.\r\n\r\nRewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,\r\naccepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as\r\nhe walked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Hynes said. I know that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It\xe2\x80\x99s pure\r\ngoodheartedness: damn the thing else.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom admired the caretaker\xe2\x80\x99s prosperous bulk. All want to be on\r\ngood terms with him. Decent fellow, John O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, real good sort.\r\nKeys: like Keyes\xe2\x80\x99s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout\r\nchecks. _Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral.\r\nDid I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she\r\ndisturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not chucked in the dead\r\nletter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross.\r\nSilver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the\r\ngumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard.\r\nDangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death.\r\nShades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The\r\nshadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O\xe2\x80\x99Connell must be\r\na descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy\r\nman great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at\r\nall. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to\r\nmake her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a\r\npitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nkiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards.\r\nLearn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here.\r\nMen like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In\r\nthe midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the\r\npoor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their\r\nvitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window.\r\nEight children he has anyway.\r\n\r\nHe has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field\r\nafter field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.\r\nSitting or kneeling you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Standing? His head might come up some\r\nday above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed\r\nthe ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim\r\ngrass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so\r\nit is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant\r\npoppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic\r\nGardens are just over there. It\xe2\x80\x99s the blood sinking in the earth gives\r\nnew life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.\r\nEvery man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,\r\ninvaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William\r\nWilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds\r\nthirteen and six. With thanks.\r\n\r\nI daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,\r\nnails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot\r\nquick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a\r\ntallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing\r\nout of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever\r\nthey are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically.\r\nNothing to feed on feed on themselves.\r\n\r\nBut they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply\r\nswirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little\r\nseaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of\r\npower seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at\r\nlife. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one\r\nabout the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11\r\np.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the\r\nmen anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin fashion. A juicy pear or ladies\xe2\x80\x99 punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep\r\nout the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.\r\nGravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human\r\nheart. Daren\xe2\x80\x99t joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis\r\nnil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.\r\nSeems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live\r\nlonger. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to\r\ntrundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,\r\nstepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin\r\nand set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.\r\n\r\nBurying him. We come to bury C\xc3\xa6sar. His ides of March or June. He\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot\r\nover there in the macintosh? Now who is he I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know? Now I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never\r\ndreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he\r\ncould. Still he\xe2\x80\x99d have to get someone to sod him after he died though\r\nhe could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too.\r\nFirst thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was\r\ntrue to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a\r\nThursday if you come to look at it.\r\n\r\n     O, poor Robinson Crusoe!\r\n     How could you possibly do so?\r\n\r\nPoor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of\r\nthem all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could\r\ninvent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that\r\nway. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the\r\nholy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one\r\ncoffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible\r\neven in the earth. The Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s house is his coffin. Embalming in\r\ncatacombs, mummies the same idea.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.\r\nTwelve. I\xe2\x80\x99m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.\r\nDeath\xe2\x80\x99s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nchapel, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.\r\n\r\nNice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had\r\none like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he\r\nwas once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey\r\nsuit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It\xe2\x80\x99s dyed. His wife I forgot he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the\r\ngravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\nIf we were all suddenly somebody else.\r\n\r\nFar away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they\r\nsay. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.\r\n\r\nGentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The\r\nboy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in\r\nthe black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly\r\ncaretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which\r\nwill go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It\xe2\x80\x99s the moment\r\nyou feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it at first. Mistake\r\nmust be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering\r\naround you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and\r\nwandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His\r\nsleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose\r\npointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the\r\npillow away and finish it off on the floor since he\xe2\x80\x99s doomed. Devil in\r\nthat picture of sinner\xe2\x80\x99s death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace\r\nher in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee_?\r\nBam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even\r\nParnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one\r\nafter the other.\r\n\r\nWe are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you\xe2\x80\x99re well and\r\nnot in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the\r\nfire of purgatory.\r\n\r\nDoes he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do\r\nwhen you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy\xe2\x80\x99s warning.\r\nNear you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,\r\npoor mamma, and little Rudy.\r\n\r\nThe gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in\r\non the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all\r\nthe time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of\r\ncourse. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some\r\nlaw to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a\r\ntelephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of\r\ndistress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well\r\nto get shut of them as soon as you are sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no.\r\n\r\nThe clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of\r\nit. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves\r\nwithout show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make\r\nits way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground,\r\nhe traversed the dismal fields.\r\n\r\nHynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he\r\nknows them all. No: coming to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your\r\nchristian name? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s name too. He\r\nasked me to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.\r\n\r\nSo he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good\r\nidea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He\r\ndied of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.\r\nCharley, you\xe2\x80\x99re my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does\r\nno harm. I saw to that, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave\r\nhim under an obligation: costs nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was\r\nover there in the...\r\n\r\nHe looked around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x99Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who he is. Is that his\r\nname?\r\n\r\nHe moved away, looking about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all\r\nthe. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good\r\nLord, what became of him?\r\n\r\nA seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, excuse me!\r\n\r\nHe stepped aside nimbly.\r\n\r\nClay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.\r\nA mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested\r\ntheir spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped\r\nhis wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The\r\ngravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards\r\nthe barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One\r\nbent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his\r\nmates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.\r\nSilently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.\r\nThe brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.\r\nThanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For\r\nyourselves just.\r\n\r\nThe mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying\r\nat whiles to read a name on a tomb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let us go round by the chief\xe2\x80\x99s grave, Hynes said. We have time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let us, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\nThey turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr\r\nPower\xe2\x80\x99s blank voice spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled\r\nwith stones. That one day he will come again.\r\n\r\nHynes shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Parnell will never come again, he said. He\xe2\x80\x99s there, all that was\r\nmortal of him. Peace to his ashes.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,\r\nbroken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,\r\nold Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on\r\nsome charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does\r\nanybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a\r\ncoalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls\xe2\x80\x99 day.\r\nTwentyseventh I\xe2\x80\x99ll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He\r\nkeeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his\r\nshears clipping. Near death\xe2\x80\x99s door. Who passed away. Who departed this\r\nlife. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of\r\nthem. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what\r\nthey were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid\r\nfive shillings in the pound. Or a woman\xe2\x80\x99s with her saucepan. I cooked\r\ngood Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that\r\npoem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest\r\nthe protestants put it. Old Dr Murren\xe2\x80\x99s. The great physician called him\r\nhome. Well it\xe2\x80\x99s God\xe2\x80\x99s acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly\r\nplastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the\r\n_Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths\r\nhung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money.\r\nStill, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome,\r\nnever withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.\r\n\r\nA bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the\r\nwedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.\r\nKnows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even\r\nsadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen\r\nmatchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be\r\nsideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was\r\ndedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this\r\ninfliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket\r\nof fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the\r\nboy. Apollo that was.\r\n\r\nHow many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.\r\nAs you are now so once were we.\r\n\r\nBesides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the\r\nvoice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in\r\nthe house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.\r\nKraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain\r\nhellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph\r\nreminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the face after\r\nfifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that\r\ndied when I was in Wisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nRtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!\r\n\r\nHe looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\nAn obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the\r\npebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey\r\nalive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.\r\nGood hidingplace for treasure.\r\n\r\nWho lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was\r\nburied here by torchlight, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Making his rounds.\r\n\r\nTail gone now.\r\n\r\nOne of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones\r\nclean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat\r\ngone bad. Well and what\xe2\x80\x99s cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that\r\n_Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a\r\ncorpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the\r\nother firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the\r\nplague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to\r\nashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by\r\nbirds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See\r\nyour whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news\r\ngo about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication.\r\nWe learned that from them. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. Regular square feed\r\nfor them. Flies come before he\xe2\x80\x99s well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of\r\ncorpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.\r\n\r\nThe gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.\r\nEnough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I\r\nwas here was Mrs Sinico\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.\r\nAnd even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I\r\nread of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running\r\ngravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after\r\ndeath. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after\r\ndeath. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like\r\nthat other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and\r\nfeel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their\r\nmaggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds:\r\nwarm fullblooded life.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.\r\n\r\nSolicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,\r\ncommissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.\r\nMat Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl,\r\ncigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got\r\nhis rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside\r\nhim. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to\r\nme. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the\r\nlilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are\r\nby.\r\n\r\nGot a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.\r\n\r\nThey stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed\r\nthe nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, he said shortly.\r\n\r\nThey walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a\r\nfew paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin\r\ncould wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his\r\nseeing it.\r\n\r\nOyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.\r\nGet the pull over him that way.\r\n\r\nThank you. How grand we are this morning!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 7 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started\r\nfor Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,\r\nPalmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,\r\nRingsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold\xe2\x80\x99s Cross. The hoarse Dublin United\r\nTramway Company\xe2\x80\x99s timekeeper bawled them off:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rathgar and Terenure!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Sandymount Green!\r\n\r\nRight and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a\r\nsingledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Start, Palmerston Park!\r\n\r\nTHE WEARER OF THE CROWN\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and\r\npolished. Parked in North Prince\xe2\x80\x99s street His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s vermilion\r\nmailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received\r\nloudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured\r\nand paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nGrossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s stores\r\nand bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped\r\ndullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it round to\r\nthe _Telegraph_ office.\r\n\r\nThe door of Ruttledge\xe2\x80\x99s office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in\r\na large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out\r\nwith a roll of papers under his cape, a king\xe2\x80\x99s courier.\r\n\r\nRed Murray\xe2\x80\x99s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the\r\nnewspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind\r\nhis ear, we can do him one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I\xe2\x80\x99ll rub that in.\r\n\r\nWe.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nRed Murray touched Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s arm with the shears and whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Brayden.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a\r\nstately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman\r\nand National Press_ and the _Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal and National Press_.\r\nDullthudding Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase,\r\nsteered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back\r\nascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck,\r\nSimon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck,\r\nfat, neck, fat, neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.\r\n\r\nThe door of Ruttledge\xe2\x80\x99s office whispered: ee: cree. They always build\r\none door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.\r\n\r\nOur Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.\r\nSteered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our\r\nSaviour.\r\n\r\nJesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his\r\nheart. In _Martha._\r\n\r\n     Co-ome thou lost one,\r\n     Co-ome thou dear one!\r\n\r\nTHE CROZIER AND THE PEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.\r\n\r\nThey watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.\r\n\r\nA telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and\r\nstepped off posthaste with a word:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Freeman!_\r\n\r\nMr Bloom said slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, he is one of our saviours also.\r\n\r\nA meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed\r\nin through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along\r\nthe now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?\r\nThumping. Thumping.\r\n\r\nHe pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn\r\npacking paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards\r\nNannetti\xe2\x80\x99s reading closet.\r\n\r\nWITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST\r\nRESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This\r\nmorning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a\r\nman to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His\r\nmachineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand:\r\nfermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing\r\nto get in.\r\n\r\nHOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Bloom halted behind the foreman\xe2\x80\x99s spare body, admiring a glossy\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nStrange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for\r\nCollege green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was\r\nworth. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news\r\nin the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in\r\nthe year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of\r\nRosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule\r\npursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets\r\nexported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake\xe2\x80\x99s weekly Pat\r\nand Bull story. Uncle Toby\xe2\x80\x99s page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nqueries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nthat part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P.\r\nMainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World\xe2\x80\x99s biggest\r\nballoon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms\r\nlaughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than\r\nthe Irish.\r\n\r\nThe machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he\r\ngot paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they\xe2\x80\x99d clank on\r\nand on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle\r\nthe whole thing. Want a cool head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.\r\n\r\nSoon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.\r\n\r\nThe foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the\r\nsheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently\r\nover the dirty glass screen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stood in his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,\r\npointing backward with his thumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you? Hynes asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tap him too.\r\n\r\nHe hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal_.\r\n\r\nThree bob I lent him in Meagher\xe2\x80\x99s. Three weeks. Third hint.\r\n\r\nWE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?\r\n\r\nMr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nThe foreman moved his pencil towards it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants\r\ntwo keys at the top.\r\n\r\nHell of a racket they make. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.\r\nMaybe he understands what I.\r\n\r\nThe foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began\r\nto scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.\r\n\r\nLet him take that in first.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the\r\nforeman\xe2\x80\x99s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the\r\nobedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles\r\nof it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels:\r\nvarious uses, thousand and one things.\r\n\r\nSlipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew\r\nswiftly on the scarred woodwork.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF KEY(E)S\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.\r\nAlexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.\r\n\r\nBetter not teach him his own business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top\r\nin leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea?\r\n\r\nThe foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched\r\nthere quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,\r\nthe Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from\r\nthe isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?\r\n\r\nI could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then\r\nif he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a\r\nhouse there too. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that\r\nand just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass\r\nlicensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.\r\n\r\nThe foreman thought for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months\xe2\x80\x99 renewal.\r\n\r\nA typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it\r\nsilently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks,\r\nwatching the silent typesetters at their cases.\r\n\r\nORTHOGRAPHICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot\r\nto give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to\r\nview the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of\r\na harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled\r\npear under a cemetery wall. Silly, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Cemetery put in of course\r\non account of the symmetry.\r\n\r\nI should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought to\r\nhave said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have\r\nsaid. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.\r\n\r\nSllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its\r\nflyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost\r\nhuman the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.\r\nThat door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in\r\nits own way. Sllt.\r\n\r\nNOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s letter? It\xe2\x80\x99s to be repeated in the\r\n_Telegraph._ Where\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\r\n\r\nHe looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Monks?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monks!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a\r\ngood place I know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monks!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThree months\xe2\x80\x99 renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it\r\nanyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge.\r\nTourists over for the show.\r\n\r\nA DAYFATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nHe walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,\r\nspectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he\r\nmust have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs\xe2\x80\x99\r\nads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his\r\ntether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I\xe2\x80\x99d say.\r\nWife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the\r\nparlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.\r\n\r\nAND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.\r\nReads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some\r\npractice that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading\r\nbackwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear,\r\nO dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of\r\nEgypt and into the house of bondage _alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai\r\nElohenu_. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s sons.\r\nAnd then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water\r\nand the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he\r\nkills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you\r\ncome to look into it well. Justice it means but it\xe2\x80\x99s everybody eating\r\neveryone else. That\xe2\x80\x99s what life is after all. How quickly he does that\r\njob. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to\r\nthe landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch\r\nhim out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as\r\nCitron\xe2\x80\x99s house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.\r\n\r\nONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP\r\n\r\n\r\nHe went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those\r\nwalls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy\r\nsmell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom\xe2\x80\x99s next door\r\nwhen I was there.\r\n\r\nHe took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap\r\nI put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief\r\nhe took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket\r\nof his trousers.\r\n\r\nWhat perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something\r\nI forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.\r\n\r\nA sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.\r\nKnow who that is. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nHe entered softly.\r\n\r\nERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to\r\nthe dusty windowpane.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s quizzing\r\nface, asked of it sourly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Agonising Christ, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it give you a heartburn on your arse?\r\n\r\nNed Lambert, seated on the table, read on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on\r\nits way, tho\xe2\x80\x99 quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling\r\nwaters of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s blue domain, \xe2\x80\x99mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest\r\nzephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or \xe2\x80\x99neath the shadows cast\r\no\xe2\x80\x99er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the\r\nforest_. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his\r\nnewspaper. How\xe2\x80\x99s that for high?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_. O boys! O boys!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on\r\nthe fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nhear any more of the stuff.\r\n\r\nHe ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,\r\nhungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.\r\n\r\nHigh falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.\r\nRather upsets a man\xe2\x80\x99s day, a funeral does. He has influence they say.\r\nOld Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his\r\ngreatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death\r\nwritten this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first\r\nhimself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges\r\nEyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on\r\ngale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered\r\nwith pomp of tone. _Our lovely land_.\r\n\r\nSHORT BUT TO THE POINT\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an\r\naccent on the whose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dan Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s land Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But listen to this, he said.\r\n\r\nThe doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was\r\npushed in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, entering.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom moved nimbly aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I beg yours, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come in. Come in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How are you, Dedalus?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well. And yourself?\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy shook his head.\r\n\r\nSAD\r\n\r\n\r\nCleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.\r\nThat hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin the wind, I wonder. Money worry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re looking extra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy asked, looking towards the\r\ninner door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nhis sanctum with Lenehan.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the\r\npink pages of the file.\r\n\r\nPractice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of\r\nhonour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and\r\nT. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their\r\nsleeve like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work\r\nfor the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford\r\nbegan on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer\r\nabout when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold\r\nin the same breath. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know which to believe. One story good till\r\nyou hear the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then\r\nall blows over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, listen to this for God\xe2\x80\x99 sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. _Or again if we\r\nbut climb the serried mountain peaks..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated\r\nwindbag!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our\r\nsouls, as it were..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he\r\ntaking anything for it?\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94As \xe2\x80\x99twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio,\r\nunmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize\r\nregions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and\r\nluscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent\r\ntranslucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._\r\n\r\nHIS NATIVE DORIC\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of\r\nthe moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and\r\nonions! That\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Ned. Life is too short.\r\n\r\nHe took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy\r\nmoustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An\r\ninstant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunshaven blackspectacled face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Doughy Daw! he cried.\r\n\r\nWHAT WETHERUP SAID\r\n\r\n\r\nAll very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot\r\ncake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Why they\r\ncall him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged\r\nto that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that\r\nnicely. Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said\r\nthat. Get a grip of them by the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested\r\nby a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared\r\nabout them and the harsh voice asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said\r\ngrandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes roved\r\ntowards Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s face, shadowed by a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.\r\n\r\nMEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We\r\nwon every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at\r\nhis toecaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In Ohio! the editor shouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.\r\n\r\nPassing out he whispered to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Incipient jigs. Sad case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.\r\nMy Ohio!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.\r\n\r\nO, HARP EOLIAN!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking\r\noff a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant\r\nunwashed teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bingbang, bangbang.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.\r\n\r\nHe went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming\r\nto the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.\r\nHello, Jack. That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Myles, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip\r\nlimply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?\r\n\r\nThe telephone whirred inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.\r\n\r\nSPOT THE WINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nLenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_\xe2\x80\x99s tissues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.\r\nMadden up.\r\n\r\nHe tossed the tissues on to the table.\r\n\r\nScreams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was\r\nflung open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin\r\nby the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the\r\nsteps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air\r\nblue scrawls and under the table came to earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There\xe2\x80\x99s a hurricane\r\nblowing.\r\n\r\nLenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he\r\nstooped twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat\r\nFarrell shoved me, sir.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Him, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.\r\n\r\nHe hustled the boy out and banged the door to.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Continued on page six, column four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.\r\nIs the boss...? Yes, _Telegraph_... To where? Aha! Which auction\r\nrooms?... Aha! I see... Right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him.\r\n\r\nA COLLISION ENSUES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped\r\nagainst Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and\r\nmaking a grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I\xe2\x80\x99m in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Knee, Lenehan said.\r\n\r\nHe made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sorry, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\r\nslapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a\r\nmouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on\r\nthe doorsteps:\r\n\r\n     We are the boys of Wexford\r\n     Who fought with heart and hand.\r\n\r\nEXIT BLOOM\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m just running round to Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this\r\nad of Keyes\xe2\x80\x99s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he\xe2\x80\x99s round there in\r\nDillon\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,\r\nleaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,\r\nsuddenly stretched forth an arm amply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Begone! he said. The world is before you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan\xe2\x80\x99s hand and read them,\r\nblowing them apart gently, without comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his\r\nblackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.\r\n\r\nA STREET CORT\xc3\x88GE\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a\r\ntail of white bowknots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the\r\nwalk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.\r\n\r\nHe began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding\r\nfeet past the fireplace to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy who placed the tissues in his\r\nreceiving hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two\r\ngone?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? the professor said, turning. They\xe2\x80\x99re gone round to the Oval for a\r\ndrink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my hat?\r\n\r\nHe walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his\r\njacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the\r\nair and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seems to be, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in\r\nmurmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the\r\nmost matches?\r\n\r\nTHE CALUMET OF PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan\r\npromptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J.\r\nJ. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy opened his case again and offered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.\r\n\r\nThe editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He\r\ndeclaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x99Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,\r\n     \xe2\x80\x99Twas empire charmed thy heart.\r\n\r\nThe professor grinned, locking his long lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.\r\n\r\nHe took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him\r\nwith quick grace, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Silence for my brandnew riddle!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Imperium romanum_, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than\r\nBritish or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.\r\n\r\nMyles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.\r\nWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the chance of a snowball in hell.\r\n\r\nTHE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,\r\nimperial, imperious, imperative.\r\n\r\nHe extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.\r\nThe Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to\r\nbe here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah_. The Roman, like the\r\nEnglishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on\r\nwhich he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal\r\nobsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to\r\nbe here. Let us construct a watercloset._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient\r\nancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s, were partial\r\nto the running stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They were nature\xe2\x80\x99s gentlemen, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy murmured. But we have\r\nalso Roman law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy asked.\r\nIt was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly\r\n...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from\r\nthe hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I escort a suppliant, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by\r\nExperience visits Notoriety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your\r\ngovernor is just gone.\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\n\r\nLenehan said to all:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,\r\nexcogitate, reply.\r\n\r\nStephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? the editor asked.\r\n\r\nBit torn off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?\r\n\r\n     On swift sail flaming\r\n     From storm and south\r\n     He comes, pale vampire,\r\n     Mouth to my mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their\r\nshoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?\r\n\r\nBullockbefriending bard.\r\n\r\nSHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr\r\nGarrett Deasy asked me to...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The\r\nbloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and\r\nmouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the\r\nwaiter\xe2\x80\x99s face in the Star and Garter. Oho!\r\n\r\nA woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of\r\nMenelaus, ten years the Greeks. O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, prince of Breffni.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he a widower? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the\r\ntypescript. Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on\r\nthe ramparts of Vienna. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget! Maximilian Karl O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell,\r\ngraf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an\r\nAustrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild\r\ngeese. O yes, every time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget that!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said quietly,\r\nturning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh turned on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And if not? he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one\r\nday...\r\n\r\nLOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for\r\nus is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never\r\nloyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin\r\nlanguage. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is\r\nthe maxim: time is money. Material domination. _Dominus!_ Lord! Where\r\nis the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend\r\nclub. But the Greek!\r\n\r\nKYRIE ELEISON!\r\n\r\n\r\nA smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Greek! he said again. _Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the\r\nSemite and the Saxon know not. _Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.\r\nI ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. _Kyrie eleison!_\r\nThe closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.\r\nWe are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered\r\nat Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that\r\nwent under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went\r\nunder. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve\r\nthe fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.\r\n\r\nHe strode away from them towards the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They went forth to battle, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said greyly, but they\r\nalways fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in\r\nthe latter half of the _matin\xc3\xa9e_. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!\r\n\r\nHe whispered then near Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear:\r\n\r\nLENEHAN\xe2\x80\x99S LIMERICK\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_There\xe2\x80\x99s a ponderous pundit MacHugh\r\nWho wears goggles of ebony hue.\r\nAs he mostly sees double\r\nTo wear them why trouble?\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t see the Joe Miller. Can you?_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.\r\n\r\nMyles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, he said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll read the rest after. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nall right.\r\n\r\nLenehan extended his hands in protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Opera? Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke\xe2\x80\x99s sphinx face reriddled.\r\n\r\nLenehan announced gladly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_The Rose of Castile_. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!\r\n\r\nHe poked Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke fell\r\nback with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.\r\n\r\nLenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nThe professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke\xe2\x80\x99s loose ties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said in\r\nquiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland\r\nbetween you? You look as though you had done the deed. General\r\nBobrikoff.\r\n\r\nOMNIUM GATHERUM\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The turf, Lenehan put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Literature, the press.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Madam Bloom, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprime favourite.\r\n\r\nLenehan gave a loud cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a\r\ncold in the park. The gate was open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU CAN DO IT!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite\r\nin it. You can do it. I see it in your face. _In the lexicon of\r\nyouth_...\r\n\r\nSee it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great\r\nnationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the\r\npublic! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn\r\nits soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said.\r\n\r\nStephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT GALLAHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in\r\nemphasis. Wait a minute. We\xe2\x80\x99ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher\r\nused to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the\r\nClarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You\r\nknow how he made his mark? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. That was the smartest piece\r\nof journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of\r\nthe invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I\r\nsuppose. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you.\r\n\r\nHe pushed past them to the files.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at here, he said turning. The _New York World_ cabled for a\r\nspecial. Remember that time?\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw\r\nhat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and\r\nthe rest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Skin-the-Goat, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that\r\ncabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.\r\nYou know Holohan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for\r\nthe corporation. A night watchman.\r\n\r\nStephen turned in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gumley? he said. You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so? A friend of my father\xe2\x80\x99s, is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind the\r\nstones, see they don\xe2\x80\x99t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius\r\nGallaher do? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away.\r\nHave you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?\r\n\r\nHe flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take page four, advertisement for Bransome\xe2\x80\x99s coffee, let us say. Have\r\nyou got that? Right.\r\n\r\nThe telephone whirred.\r\n\r\nA DISTANT VOICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer it, the professor said, going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94B is parkgate. Good.\r\n\r\nHis finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nThe loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock\xe2\x80\x99s wattles. An illstarched\r\ndicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his\r\nwaistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello? _Evening Telegraph_ here... Hello?... Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?... Yes...\r\nYes... Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,\r\nInchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.\r\nGot that? X is Davy\xe2\x80\x99s publichouse in upper Leeson street.\r\n\r\nThe professor came to the inner door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom is at the telephone, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npublichouse, see?\r\n\r\nCLEVER, VERY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Clever, Lenehan said. Very.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nNightmare from which you will never awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the\r\nbesthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nLenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Madam, I\xe2\x80\x99m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s street was\r\nthere first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of\r\nan advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the\r\nleg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._\r\nNow he\xe2\x80\x99s got in with Blumenfeld. That\xe2\x80\x99s press. That\xe2\x80\x99s talent. Pyatt! He\r\nwas all their daddies!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the\r\nbrother-in-law of Chris Callinan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s here still. Come across\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.\r\n\r\nHe flung the pages down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very smart, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said.\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh came from the inner office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers\r\nwere up before the recorder...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O yes, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home\r\nthrough the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that\r\ncyclone last year and thought she\xe2\x80\x99d buy a view of Dublin. And it turned\r\nout to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or\r\nSkin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.\r\nPsha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those\r\nfellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O\xe2\x80\x99Hagan.\r\nEh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.\r\n\r\nHis mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.\r\n\r\nWould anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you\r\nwrite it then?\r\n\r\nRHYMES AND REASONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be\r\nsome. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the\r\nsame, looking the same, two by two.\r\n\r\n     ........................ la tua pace\r\n     .................. che parlar ti piace\r\n     Mentre che il vento, come fa, si tace.\r\n\r\nHe saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in\r\nrusset, entwining, _per l\xe2\x80\x99aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella\r\npacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar f\xc3\xa8 pi\xc3\xb9 ardenti._\r\nBut I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth\r\nsouth: tomb womb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Speak up for yourself, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said.\r\n\r\nSUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false\r\nconstruction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for\r\nthe third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running\r\naway with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes\r\nand Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod\r\nboss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the\r\nBowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s Budget_, _Pue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nOccurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_. Why bring\r\nin a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the\r\nday is the newspaper thereof.\r\n\r\nLINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his\r\nface. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.\r\nWho have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it\r\nin his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for\r\n.... But no matter.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life\r\nfell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,\r\nthe Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.\r\n\r\n     _And in the porches of mine ear did pour._\r\n\r\nBy the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other\r\nstory, beast with two backs?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What was that? the professor asked.\r\n\r\nITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, of Roman justice\r\nas contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_. And he\r\ncited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!\r\n\r\nPause. J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy took out his cigarettecase.\r\n\r\nFalse lull. Something quite ordinary.\r\n\r\nMessenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.\r\n\r\nI have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that\r\nit was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,\r\nthat determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.\r\n\r\nA POLISHED PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy resumed, moulding his words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and\r\nterrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and\r\nof prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of\r\nsculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of\r\nsoultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._\r\n\r\nHis slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The divine afflatus, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You like it? J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy asked Stephen.\r\n\r\nStephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He\r\ntook a cigarette from the case. J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy offered his case to\r\nMyles Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his\r\ntrophy, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Muchibus thankibus.\r\n\r\nA MAN OF HIGH MORALE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said\r\nto Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal\r\nhush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it.\r\nShe was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee\r\ninterviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to\r\nask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have\r\nbeen pulling A. E.\xe2\x80\x99s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale,\r\nMagennis.\r\n\r\nSpeaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say\r\nabout me? Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.\r\nWait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I\r\never heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical\r\nsociety. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had\r\nspoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),\r\nadvocating the revival of the Irish tongue.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards Myles Crawford and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, rumour has it, on\r\nthe Trinity college estates commission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrock. Go on. Well?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,\r\nfull of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will\r\nnot say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man\xe2\x80\x99s contumely\r\nupon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak,\r\ntherefore worthless.\r\n\r\nHe closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an\r\noutspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and\r\nringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nIMPROMPTU\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ferial tone he addressed J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had\r\nprepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one\r\nshorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy\r\nbeard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he\r\nlooked (though he was not) a dying man.\r\n\r\nHis gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s towards\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His\r\nunglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his\r\nwithering hair. Still seeking, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When Fitzgibbon\xe2\x80\x99s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.\r\nBriefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.\r\n\r\nHe raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.\r\nWitless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.\r\n\r\nHe began:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in\r\nlistening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment\r\nsince by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported\r\ninto a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this\r\nage, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the\r\nspeech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful\r\nMoses._\r\n\r\nHis listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes\r\nascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. _And let our\r\ncrooked smokes._ Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand\r\nat it yourself?\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian\r\nhighpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard\r\nhis words and their meaning was revealed to me._\r\n\r\nFROM THE FATHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are\r\ncorrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they\r\nwere good could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That\xe2\x80\x99s saint Augustine.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our\r\nlanguage? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.\r\nYou have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and\r\nour galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise\r\nfurrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from\r\nprimitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong\r\nhistory and a polity._\r\n\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nChild, man, effigy.\r\n\r\nBy the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple\r\nin combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and\r\nmysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.\r\nYours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is\r\nweak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her\r\narms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at\r\nour name._\r\n\r\nA dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it\r\nboldly:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and\r\naccepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will\r\nand bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never\r\nhave brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor\r\nfollowed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken\r\nwith the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai\xe2\x80\x99s mountaintop nor ever have\r\ncome down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and\r\nbearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of\r\nthe outlaw._\r\n\r\nHe ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.\r\n\r\nOMINOUS\xe2\x80\x94FOR HIM!\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said not without regret:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A\xe2\x80\x94sudden\xe2\x80\x94at\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94moment\xe2\x80\x94though\xe2\x80\x94from\xe2\x80\x94lingering\xe2\x80\x94illness\xe2\x80\x94often\xe2\x80\x94previously\xe2\x80\x94\r\nexpectorated\xe2\x80\x94demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future behind him.\r\n\r\nThe troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and\r\npattering up the staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.\r\n\r\nGone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles\r\nof ears of porches. The tribune\xe2\x80\x99s words, howled and scattered to the\r\nfour winds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic\r\nrecords of all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nI have money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I\r\nsuggest that the house do now adjourn?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? Mr\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke asked. \xe2\x80\x99Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour\r\nsay ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To\r\nwhich particular boosing shed...? My casting vote is: Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\n\r\nHe led the way, admonishing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,\r\nwe will not. By no manner of means.\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally\xe2\x80\x99s lunge of his\r\numbrella:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lay on, Macduff!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the\r\nshoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Foot and mouth. I know. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. That\xe2\x80\x99ll go in. Where are\r\nthey? That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.\r\n\r\nLET US HOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.\r\n\r\nHe went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? It\r\nhas the prophetic vision. _Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.\r\nKingdoms of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nThe first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and\r\nrushed out into the street, yelling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Racing special!\r\n\r\nDublin. I have much, much to learn.\r\n\r\nThey turned to the left along Abbey street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have a vision too, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAnother newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Racing special!\r\n\r\nDEAR DIRTY DUBLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDubliners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty\r\nand fiftythree years in Fumbally\xe2\x80\x99s lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is that? the professor asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nDamp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering\r\ntallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records.\r\nQuicker, darlint!\r\n\r\nOn now. Dare it. Let there be life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar.\r\nThey save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They\r\nshake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies\r\nwith the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in\r\ncoppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their\r\numbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.\r\n\r\nLIFE ON THE RAW\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at\r\nthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate\r\nCollins, proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from\r\na girl at the foot of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar to take off the thirst of the\r\nbrawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile\r\nand begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,\r\nencouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the\r\nother have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,\r\nthreatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God.\r\nThey had no idea it was that high.\r\n\r\nTheir names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the\r\nlumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who\r\ngot a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a\r\ncrubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can\r\nsee them. What\xe2\x80\x99s keeping our friend?\r\n\r\nHe turned.\r\n\r\nA bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all\r\ndirections, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them\r\nMyles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet\r\nface, talking with J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.\r\n\r\nHe set off again to walk by Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nRETURN OF BLOOM\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, he said. I see them.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the\r\noffices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Crawford! A moment!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Telegraph_! Racing special!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.\r\n\r\nA newsboy cried in Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!\r\n\r\nINTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,\r\npuffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes\r\njust now. He\xe2\x80\x99ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee. But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the\r\nSaturday pink. And he wants it copied if it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late I told\r\ncouncillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_. I can have access to it\r\nin the national library. House of keys, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? His name is\r\nKeyes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a play on the name. But he practically promised he\xe2\x80\x99d give\r\nthe renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr\r\nCrawford?\r\n\r\nK.M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing\r\nout his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.\r\n\r\nA bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.\r\nLenehan\xe2\x80\x99s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is\r\nthat young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him\r\ntoday. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in\r\nmuck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a short par. He\xe2\x80\x99d give the ad, I think. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nhim...\r\n\r\nK.M.R.I.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his\r\nshoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on\r\njerkily.\r\n\r\nRAISING THE WIND\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I\xe2\x80\x99m up to\r\nhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to\r\nback a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take\r\nthe will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the\r\nwind anyhow.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught\r\nup on the others and walked abreast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty\r\nfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the\r\nrailings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old\r\nDublin women on the top of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar.\r\n\r\nSOME COLUMN!\xe2\x80\x94THAT\xe2\x80\x99S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s new, Myles Crawford said. That\xe2\x80\x99s copy. Out for the waxies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDargle. Two old trickies, what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see\r\nthe roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines\xe2\x80\x99\r\nblue dome, Adam and Eve\xe2\x80\x99s, saint Laurence O\xe2\x80\x99Toole\xe2\x80\x99s. But it makes them\r\ngiddy to look so they pull up their skirts...\r\n\r\nTHOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the\r\narchdiocese here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue\r\nof the onehandled adulterer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the\r\nidea. I see what you mean.\r\n\r\nDAMES DONATE DUBLIN\xe2\x80\x99S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too\r\ntired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between\r\nthem and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with\r\ntheir handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and\r\nspitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden\r\nBurke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.\r\n\r\nSOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH\r\nMOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of\r\nGorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were\r\nbitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble\r\nand a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of\r\nbeauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.\r\n\r\nPoor Penelope. Penelope Rich.\r\n\r\nThey made ready to cross O\xe2\x80\x99Connell street.\r\n\r\nHELLO THERE, CENTRAL!\r\n\r\n\r\nAt various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless\r\ntrolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,\r\nRathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,\r\nRingsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper\r\nRathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs,\r\ndelivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water\r\nfloats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nWHAT?\xe2\x80\x94AND LIKEWISE\xe2\x80\x94WHERE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the\r\nplums?\r\n\r\nVIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to\r\nreflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: _deus nobis h\xc3\xa6c otia fecit._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Stephen said. I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The\r\nParable of The Plums._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, the professor said.\r\n\r\nHe laughed richly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land.\r\nWe gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy.\r\n\r\nHORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held\r\nhis peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, the professor said.\r\n\r\nHe halted on sir John Gray\xe2\x80\x99s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson\r\nthrough the meshes of his wry smile.\r\n\r\nDIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE\r\nWIMBLES, FLO WANGLES\xe2\x80\x94YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntruth was known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 8 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nPineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugarsticky girl\r\nshovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school\r\ntreat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His\r\nMajesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne sucking red\r\njujubes white.\r\n\r\nA sombre Y. M. C. A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of\r\nGraham Lemon\xe2\x80\x99s, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.\r\n\r\nHeart to heart talks.\r\n\r\nBloo... Me? No.\r\n\r\nBlood of the Lamb.\r\n\r\nHis slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are\r\nwashed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen,\r\nmartyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering,\r\ndruids\xe2\x80\x99 altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of\r\nthe church in Zion is coming.\r\n\r\n     Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!!\r\n     All heartily welcome.\r\n\r\nPaying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put\r\nthe stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the\r\nluminous crucifix. Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see\r\nhim on the wall, hanging. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s ghost idea. Iron Nails Ran In.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for\r\ninstance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to\r\nthe pantry in the kitchen. Don\xe2\x80\x99t like all the smells in it waiting to\r\nrush out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of\r\nSpain. Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny.\r\nVery good for the brain.\r\n\r\nFrom Butler\xe2\x80\x99s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s walk.\r\nDedalus\xe2\x80\x99 daughter there still outside Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s auctionrooms. Must be\r\nselling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father.\r\nLobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother\r\ngoes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That\xe2\x80\x99s in their\r\ntheology or the priest won\xe2\x80\x99t give the poor woman the confession, the\r\nabsolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat\r\nyou out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on\r\nthe fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them\r\ndo the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for\r\nfear he\xe2\x80\x99d collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows\r\nif you could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting\r\n\xc2\xa3. s. d. out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one.\r\nWatching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence:\r\nmum\xe2\x80\x99s the word.\r\n\r\nGood Lord, that poor child\xe2\x80\x99s dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks\r\ntoo. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It\xe2\x80\x99s after they feel it.\r\nProof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.\r\n\r\nAs he set foot on O\xe2\x80\x99Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from\r\nthe parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours\r\nit, I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see\r\nthe brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats\r\nget in too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead\r\ndrunk on the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians.\r\nImagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nLooking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt\r\nquaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben\r\nJ\xe2\x80\x99s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and\r\neightpence too much. Hhhhm. It\xe2\x80\x99s the droll way he comes out with the\r\nthings. Knows how to tell a story too.\r\n\r\nThey wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.\r\n\r\nHe threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet\r\nper sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of\r\nswells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the\r\nday I threw that stale cake out of the Erin\xe2\x80\x99s King picked it up in the\r\nwake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.\r\n\r\n     The hungry famished gull\r\n     Flaps o\xe2\x80\x99er the waters dull.\r\n\r\nThat is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has\r\nno rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts.\r\nSolemn.\r\n\r\n     Hamlet, I am thy father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit\r\n     Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x94Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!\r\n\r\nHis gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.\r\nAustralians they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them\r\nup with a rag or a handkerchief.\r\n\r\nWait. Those poor birds.\r\n\r\nHe halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes\r\nfor a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down\r\ninto the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all\r\nfrom their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.\r\n\r\nAware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his\r\nhands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they\r\nhave, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down\r\nhere sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder\r\nwhat kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.\r\n\r\nThey wheeled flapping weakly. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to throw any more. Penny\r\nquite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and\r\nmouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes\r\nlike that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are\r\nnot salty? How is that?\r\n\r\nHis eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor\r\non the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.\r\n\r\n     Kino\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n     11/\xe2\x80\x94\r\n     Trousers\r\n\r\nGood idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you\r\nown water really? It\xe2\x80\x99s always flowing in a stream, never the same,\r\nwhich in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All\r\nkinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used\r\nto be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly\r\nconfidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t cost him a red like Maginni the\r\ndancing master self advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or\r\nstick them up himself for that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen\r\na button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110\r\nPILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.\r\n\r\nIf he...?\r\n\r\nO!\r\n\r\nEh?\r\n\r\nNo... No.\r\n\r\nNo, no. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surely?\r\n\r\nNo, no.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about\r\nthat. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time.\r\nFascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball\xe2\x80\x99s. Parallax. I never\r\nexactly understood. There\xe2\x80\x99s a priest. Could ask him. Par it\xe2\x80\x99s Greek:\r\nparallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her\r\nabout the transmigration. O rocks!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the\r\nsound. She\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was\r\nthinking. Still, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base\r\nbarreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you\xe2\x80\x99d think he was\r\nsinging into a barrel. Now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that wit. They used to call him big\r\nBen. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an\r\nalbatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at\r\nstowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.\r\n\r\nA procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him\r\nalong the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like\r\nthat priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He\r\nread the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S.\r\nWisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his\r\nforeboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our\r\nstaple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after\r\nstreet. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are\r\nnot Boyl: no, M\xe2\x80\x99Glade\xe2\x80\x99s men. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring in any business either. I\r\nsuggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls\r\nsitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I\r\nbet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the\r\neye at once. Everyone dying to know what she\xe2\x80\x99s writing. Get twenty of\r\nthem round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women\r\ntoo. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it of course because he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a\r\nfalse stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npotted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can\xe2\x80\x99t lick \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nWhat? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can\xe2\x80\x99t stop,\r\nRobinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser\r\n_Kansell,_ sold by Hely\xe2\x80\x99s Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I\r\nam. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.\r\nTranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.\r\nWimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed\r\nin love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I\r\ndisturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate\r\nwith the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of\r\nMount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by\r\nthe way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they\r\nreally were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the\r\nsame. No lard for them. My heart\xe2\x80\x99s broke eating dripping. They like\r\nbuttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister?\r\nPat Claffey, the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. It was a nun they say invented\r\nbarbed wire.\r\n\r\nHe crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover\r\ncycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil\r\nGilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom\xe2\x80\x99s. Got\r\nthe job in Wisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s year we married. Six years. Ten years ago:\r\nninetyfour he died yes that\xe2\x80\x99s right the big fire at Arnott\xe2\x80\x99s. Val\r\nDillon was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly\r\nemptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it\r\nfor the inner alderman. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what the band played. For what we\r\nhave already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then.\r\nMolly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored\r\nwith selfcovered buttons. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it because I sprained my\r\nankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old\r\nGoodwin\xe2\x80\x99s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies\xe2\x80\x99 picnic too.\r\nNever put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,\r\nshoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we\r\nhad that day. People looking after her.\r\n\r\nHappy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.\r\nDockrell\xe2\x80\x99s, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly\xe2\x80\x99s tubbing night. American\r\nsoap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she\r\nlooked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.\r\n\r\nHe walked along the curbstone.\r\n\r\nStream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was\r\nalways squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in\r\nCitron\xe2\x80\x99s saint Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is\r\ngetting. Pen ...? Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s years ago. Noise of the trams\r\nprobably. Well, if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the dayfather\xe2\x80\x99s name that he\r\nsees every day.\r\n\r\nBartell d\xe2\x80\x99Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home\r\nafter practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her\r\nthat song _Winds that blow from the south_.\r\n\r\nWindy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting\r\non about those lottery tickets after Goodwin\xe2\x80\x99s concert in the\r\nsupperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of\r\nher music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky\r\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.\r\nProfessor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old\r\nsot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage.\r\nMay be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the\r\nwind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that\r\ngust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old\r\nGoodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home\r\nraking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her\r\nsupper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see\r\nher in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays:\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nSwish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.\r\nAlways liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two\r\ntaking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.\r\nThat was the night...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her for\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in\r\nMullingar, you know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go away! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that grand for her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. In a photographer\xe2\x80\x99s there. Getting on like a house on fire. How\r\nare all your charges?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All on the baker\xe2\x80\x99s list, Mrs Breen said.\r\n\r\nHow many has she? No other in sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re in black, I see. You have no...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.\r\n\r\nGoing to crop up all day, I foresee. Who\xe2\x80\x99s dead, when and what did he\r\ndie of? Turn up like a bad penny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any near relation.\r\n\r\nMay as well get her sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,\r\npoor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.\r\n\r\n     Your funeral\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow\r\n     While you\xe2\x80\x99re coming through the rye.\r\n     Diddlediddle dumdum\r\n     Diddlediddle...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen\xe2\x80\x99s womaneyes said melancholily.\r\n\r\nNow that\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And your lord and master?\r\n\r\nMrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost them anyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking! she said. He\xe2\x80\x99s a caution to rattlesnakes. He\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthere now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me\r\nheartscalded. Wait till I show you.\r\n\r\nHot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured\r\nout from Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,\r\nor they\xe2\x80\x99d taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab\r\nstood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of\r\nhunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork\r\nchained to the table.\r\n\r\nOpening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on\r\nthose things. Stick it in a chap\xe2\x80\x99s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.\r\nMoney. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.\r\nHusband barging. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are\r\nyou feeding your little brother\xe2\x80\x99s family? Soiled handkerchief:\r\nmedicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There must be a new moon out, she said. He\xe2\x80\x99s always bad then. Do you\r\nknow what he did last night?\r\n\r\nHer hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in\r\nalarm, yet smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\nLet her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.\r\n\r\nIndiges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nShe took a folded postcard from her handbag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Read that, she said. He got it this morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U. P.?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94U. p: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\nshame for them whoever he is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nShe took back the card, sighing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And now he\xe2\x80\x99s going round to Mr Menton\xe2\x80\x99s office. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to take an\r\naction for ten thousand pounds, he says.\r\n\r\nShe folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.\r\n\r\nSame blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen\r\nits best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three\r\nold grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a\r\ntasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than\r\nMolly.\r\n\r\nSee the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.\r\n\r\nHe looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.\r\nPungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry too. Flakes of\r\npastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her\r\ncheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie\r\nPowell that was. In Luke Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s long ago. Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn, the\r\ncharades. U. p: up.\r\n\r\nChange the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mina Purefoy? she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers\xe2\x80\x99 Club. Matcham often thinks of\r\nthe masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nlying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She\xe2\x80\x99s three\r\ndays bad now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Mr Bloom said. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very stiff\r\nbirth, the nurse told me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHis heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in\r\ncompassion. Dth! Dth!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterrible for her.\r\n\r\nMrs Breen nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She was taken bad on the Tuesday...\r\n\r\nMr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mind! Let this man pass.\r\n\r\nA bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a\r\nrapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a\r\nskullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,\r\na stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts.\r\nWatch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is he if it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His name is Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr\r\nBloom said smiling. Watch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nShe broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to\r\nMolly, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis\r\nBreen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of\r\nHarrison\xe2\x80\x99s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay.\r\nLike old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and\r\nthrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he\r\nspoke earnestly.\r\n\r\nMeshuggah. Off his chump.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the\r\ntight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two\r\ndays. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world.\r\nAnd that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nU. p: up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath that\xe2\x80\x99s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote\r\nit for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nHe passed the _Irish Times_. There might be other answers lying there.\r\nLike to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their\r\nlunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know me. O, leave them\r\nthere to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them.\r\nWanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called\r\nyou naughty darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell\r\nme what is the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife.\r\nTell me who made the world. The way they spring those questions on you.\r\nAnd the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good\r\nfortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo.\r\nRussell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nBest paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook\r\nand general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit\r\ncounter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork\r\nshop. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made\r\na big deal on Coates\xe2\x80\x99s shares. Ca\xe2\x80\x99 canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All\r\nthe toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the _Irish\r\nField_ now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement\r\nand rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement\r\nyesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects\r\njuices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse\r\nlike a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her,\r\nnot for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood\r\nmare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss\r\noff a glass of brandy neat while you\xe2\x80\x99d say knife. That one at the\r\nGrosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or\r\nfivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it\r\nout of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that\r\nsold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel.\r\nDivorced Spanish American. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a feather out of her my handling\r\nthem. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when\r\nStubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the _Express._\r\nScavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the\r\nplums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few\r\nweeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work\r\nfor her, thanks.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun\r\nand milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating\r\nwith a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his\r\nmuttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy\r\nannuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers\r\nmarching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a\r\nmarketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast\r\nyear after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t\xe2\x80\x99s are. Dog in\r\nthe manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.\r\n\r\nHe stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at\r\nRowe\xe2\x80\x99s? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in\r\nthe Burton. Better. On my way.\r\n\r\nHe walked on past Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot\r\nto tap Tom Kernan.\r\n\r\nSss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a\r\nvinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew!\r\nDreadful simply! Child\xe2\x80\x99s head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her\r\ntrying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me\r\nthat would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent\r\nsomething to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea:\r\nqueen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman\r\nthat lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was\r\nconsumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the\r\nwhat was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to\r\nfeed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing\r\nquite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at\r\ncompound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings\r\nand five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage\r\npeople to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years\r\nwant to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.\r\n\r\nNot stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nFunny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs\r\nMoisel. Mothers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then\r\nreturns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes.\r\nWeight off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my\r\nbabies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall\xe2\x80\x99s son. His first\r\nbow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People\r\nknocking them up at all hours. For God\xe2\x80\x99 sake, doctor. Wife in her\r\nthroes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on\r\nyour wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.\r\n\r\nBefore the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of\r\npigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I\r\npick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here\xe2\x80\x99s good luck. Must be\r\nthrilling from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the\r\ntrees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.\r\n\r\nA squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian\r\nfile. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their\r\ntruncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their\r\nbelts. Policeman\xe2\x80\x99s lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and\r\nscattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment\r\nto attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of\r\nothers, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the\r\nstation. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare\r\nto receive soup.\r\n\r\nHe crossed under Tommy Moore\xe2\x80\x99s roguish finger. They did right to put\r\nhim up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for\r\nwomen. Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. _There is not in\r\nthis wide world a vallee_. Great song of Julia Morkan\xe2\x80\x99s. Kept her voice\r\nup to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe\xe2\x80\x99s, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\n\r\nHe gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack\r\nPower could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them\r\ntrouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the\r\nbridewell. Can\xe2\x80\x99t blame them after all with the job they have especially\r\nthe young hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was\r\ngiven his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did!\r\nHis horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had\r\nthe presence of mind to dive into Manning\xe2\x80\x99s or I was souped. He did\r\ncome a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the\r\ncobblestones. I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have got myself swept along with those\r\nmedicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for\r\ntrouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting\r\nfor me in the Mater and now he\xe2\x80\x99s in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy.\r\nWheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled.\r\nWhy he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Up the Boers!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three cheers for De Wet!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.\r\n\r\nSilly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill.\r\nThe Butter exchange band. Few years\xe2\x80\x99 time half of them magistrates and\r\ncivil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows\r\nused to. Whether on the scaffold high.\r\n\r\nNever know who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in\r\nhis eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on\r\nthe invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to\r\nget in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the\r\ncastle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are\r\nalways courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform.\r\nSquarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next\r\nthing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was\r\nthe young master saying anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole.\r\nDecoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms\r\nironing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are those yours, Mary?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear such things... Stop or I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the missus on you. Out\r\nhalf the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, gelong with your great times coming.\r\n\r\nBarmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.\r\n\r\nJames Stephens\xe2\x80\x99 idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that\r\na fellow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out\r\nyou get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the\r\nBuckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nYou must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a\r\nsquareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about\r\nour lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company\xe2\x80\x99s tearoom.\r\nDebating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government.\r\nThat the language question should take precedence of the economic\r\nquestion. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them\r\nup with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good lump of thyme\r\nseasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease\r\nbefore it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk\r\nwith the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap\r\npays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show\r\nus over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day.\r\nHomerule sun rising up in the northwest.\r\n\r\nHis smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,\r\nshadowing Trinity\xe2\x80\x99s surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing,\r\noutgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day:\r\nsquads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies\r\nmooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed\r\ngroaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second\r\nsomewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five\r\nminutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born,\r\nwashing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling\r\nmaaaaaa.\r\n\r\nCityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other\r\ncoming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of\r\npavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that.\r\nLandlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets\r\nhis notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have\r\nall the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away\r\nage after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves\r\nChinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble,\r\nsprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan\xe2\x80\x99s mushroom houses built of\r\nbreeze. Shelter, for the night.\r\n\r\nNo-one is anything.\r\n\r\nThis is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate\r\nthis hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.\r\n\r\nProvost\xe2\x80\x99s house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in\r\nthere. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in it if they paid me.\r\nHope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the\r\nsilverware opposite in Walter Sexton\xe2\x80\x99s window by which John Howard\r\nParnell passed, unseeing.\r\n\r\nThere he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncoincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmeet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a\r\ncorporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his\r\nhigh horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the\r\nwoebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a\r\npain. Great man\xe2\x80\x99s brother: his brother\xe2\x80\x99s brother. He\xe2\x80\x99d look nice on the\r\ncity charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess\r\nthere. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to\r\npass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nfascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other\r\nsister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright\r\nlike surgeon M\xe2\x80\x99Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath.\r\nApply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The\r\npatriot\xe2\x80\x99s banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said\r\nwhen they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the\r\ngrave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which\r\nthe ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks\r\nwith a Scotch accent. The tentacles...\r\n\r\nThey passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and\r\nbicycle. Young woman.\r\n\r\nAnd there he is too. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s really a coincidence: second time.\r\nComing events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the\r\neminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A.\r\nE.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur\r\nEdmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the\r\nworld with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult:\r\nsymbolism. Holding forth. She\xe2\x80\x99s taking it all in. Not saying a word. To\r\naid gentleman in literary work.\r\n\r\nHis eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a\r\nlistening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only\r\nweggebobbles and fruit. Don\xe2\x80\x99t eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of\r\nthat cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it\xe2\x80\x99s healthier.\r\nWindandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a\r\nbloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me\r\nnutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating\r\nrumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by\r\nthe tap all night.\r\n\r\nHer stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless.\r\nThose literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy,\r\nsymbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it was that\r\nkind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.\r\nFor example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their\r\nshirts you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.\r\n\r\n     The dreamy cloudy gull\r\n     Waves o\xe2\x80\x99er the waters dull.\r\n\r\nHe crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of\r\nYeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old\r\nHarris\xe2\x80\x99s and have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow.\r\nProbably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right.\r\nGoerz lenses six guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on\r\neasy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in\r\nthe railway lost property office. Astonishing the things people leave\r\nbehind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about?\r\nWomen too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up\r\nthat farmer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x99s bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction.\r\nUnclaimed money too. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little watch up there on the roof of the\r\nbank to test those glasses by.\r\n\r\nHis lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can\xe2\x80\x99t see it. If\r\nyou imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s there you can almost see it. Can\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\r\n\r\nHe faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right\r\nhand at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes:\r\ncompletely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun\xe2\x80\x99s disk.\r\nMust be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses.\r\nInteresting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were\r\nin Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific\r\nexplosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nNow that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there\r\nsome first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to\r\nprofessor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do\r\nto: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected.\r\nNobleman proud to be descended from some king\xe2\x80\x99s mistress. His\r\nforemother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land.\r\nNot go in and blurt out what you know you\xe2\x80\x99re not to: what\xe2\x80\x99s parallax?\r\nShow this gentleman the door.\r\n\r\nAh.\r\n\r\nHis hand fell to his side again.\r\n\r\nNever know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,\r\ncrossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then\r\nsolid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen\r\nrock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she\r\nsaid. I believe there is.\r\n\r\nHe went on by la maison Claire.\r\n\r\nWait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly\r\nthere is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview\r\nmoon. She was humming. The young May moon she\xe2\x80\x99s beaming, love. He other\r\nside of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm\xe2\x80\x99s la-amp is gleaming, love.\r\nTouch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.\r\n\r\nStop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.\r\n\r\nWith a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here\r\nmiddle of the day of Bob Doran\xe2\x80\x99s bottle shoulders. On his annual bend,\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or _cherchez la\r\nfemme_. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the\r\nrest of the year sober as a judge.\r\n\r\nYes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him\r\ngood. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon\r\nface in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies,\r\neh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking,\r\nlaughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat.\r\nCoarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white\r\nhat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp\r\nthat once did starve us all.\r\n\r\nI was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was.\r\nShe twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed.\r\nCould never like it again after Rudy. Can\xe2\x80\x99t bring back time. Like\r\nholding water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning\r\nthen. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty\r\nboy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nGrafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,\r\nsilkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in\r\nthe baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings.\r\nHope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef\r\nto the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out\r\nof plumb.\r\n\r\nHe passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers.\r\nCascades of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its\r\nmouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots\r\nbrought that here. _La causa \xc3\xa8 santa!_ Tara tara. Great chorus that.\r\nTaree tara. Must be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.\r\n\r\nPincushions. I\xe2\x80\x99m a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all\r\nover the place. Needles in window curtains.\r\n\r\nHe bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today\r\nanyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps.\r\nJunejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike it. Women won\xe2\x80\x99t pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.\r\n\r\nGleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nUseless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.\r\n\r\nHigh voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home\r\nand houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath\r\nNetaim. Wealth of the world.\r\n\r\nA warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.\r\nPerfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he\r\nmutely craved to adore.\r\n\r\nDuke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.\r\n\r\nHe turned Combridge\xe2\x80\x99s corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.\r\nPerfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer\r\nfields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements,\r\nalong sofas, creaking beds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jack, love!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Darling!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kiss me, Reggy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My boy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Love!\r\n\r\nHis heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink\r\ngripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See\r\nthe animals feed.\r\n\r\nMen, men, men.\r\n\r\nPerched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables\r\ncalling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy\r\nfood, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced\r\nyoung man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin.\r\nNew set of microbes. A man with an infant\xe2\x80\x99s saucestained napkin tucked\r\nround him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back\r\non his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew\r\nit. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves\r\nas others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the\r\nschoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what\r\nhe was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to\r\nChristianity. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow it all however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Roast beef and cabbage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One stew.\r\n\r\nSmells of men. Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek\r\nof plug, spilt beer, men\xe2\x80\x99s beery piss, the stale of ferment.\r\n\r\nHis gorge rose.\r\n\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all\r\nbefore him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing\r\nthe cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then\r\non that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it\r\noff the plate, man! Get out of this.\r\n\r\nHe gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of\r\nhis nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two stouts here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One corned and cabbage.\r\n\r\nThat fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended\r\non it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his\r\nthree hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a\r\nsilver knife in his mouth. That\xe2\x80\x99s witty, I think. Or no. Silver means\r\nborn rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.\r\n\r\nAn illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head\r\nbailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard.\r\nWell up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork\r\nupright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the\r\nfoodlift across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him\r\nsomething with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I\r\nmunched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not here. Don\xe2\x80\x99t see him.\r\n\r\nOut. I hate dirty eaters.\r\n\r\nHe backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s. Stopgap.\r\nKeep me going. Had a good breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Roast and mashed here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pint of stout.\r\n\r\nEvery fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.\r\n\r\nHe came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street.\r\nEat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!\r\n\r\nSuppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down\r\nwith porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the\r\nstreet. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s son don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women\r\nand children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From\r\nAilesbury road, Clyde road, artisans\xe2\x80\x99 dwellings, north Dublin union,\r\nlord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My\r\nplate\xe2\x80\x99s empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir\r\nPhilip Crampton\xe2\x80\x99s fountain. Rub off the microbes with your\r\nhandkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O\xe2\x80\x99Flynn\r\nwould make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number\r\none. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as\r\nbig as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of\r\nit. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel _table d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4te_ she\r\ncalled it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nchewing. Then who\xe2\x80\x99d wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all\r\nfeeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.\r\n\r\nAfter all there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from\r\nthe earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp\r\nof onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw\r\nfowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe\r\nto split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering\r\nbob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers\xe2\x80\x99 buckets wobbly lights. Give us that\r\nbrisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed\r\nsheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling\r\nnosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t maul them pieces,\r\nyoung one.\r\n\r\nHot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed.\r\nInsidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.\r\n\r\nAh, I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry.\r\n\r\nHe entered Davy Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s. Moral pub. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t chat. Stands a drink now\r\nand then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.\r\n\r\nWhat will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Flynn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x99s things?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tiptop... Let me see. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.\r\n\r\nSardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham\r\nand his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is\r\nhome without Plumtree\xe2\x80\x99s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad!\r\nUnder the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npotted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too\r\nsalty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of\r\nhonour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch\r\nthe effect. _There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something\r\nthe somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger_. With it an abode of\r\nbliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked\r\nand minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together.\r\nHygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of\r\ninside. Peace and war depend on some fellow\xe2\x80\x99s digestion. Religions.\r\nChristmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be\r\nmerry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all\r\nbut itself. Mity cheese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you a cheese sandwich?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nLike a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of\r\nburgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,\r\nTom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served\r\nme that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God\r\nmade food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wife well?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn sipped his grog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Doing any singing those times?\r\n\r\nLook at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.\r\nMusic. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.\r\nDoes no harm. Free ad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She\xe2\x80\x99s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No. O, that\xe2\x80\x99s the style. Who\xe2\x80\x99s getting it up?\r\n\r\nThe curate served.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How much is that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. _Mr MacTrigger_. Easier\r\nthan the dreamy creamy stuff. _His five hundred wives. Had the time of\r\ntheir lives._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mustard, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you.\r\n\r\nHe studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. _Their lives_. I have\r\nit. _It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Getting it up? he said. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a company idea, you see. Part\r\nshares and part profits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket\r\nto scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Blazes Boylan\r\nmixed up in it?\r\n\r\nA warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He\r\nraised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock\r\nfive minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.\r\n\r\nHis midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,\r\nlongingly.\r\n\r\nWine.\r\n\r\nHe smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to\r\nspeed it, set his wineglass delicately down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, he said. He\xe2\x80\x99s the organiser in point of fact.\r\n\r\nNo fear: no brains.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that\r\nboxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello\r\nbarracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he\r\nwas telling me...\r\n\r\nHope that dewdrop doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God\r\ntill further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is\r\na hairy chap.\r\n\r\nDavy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,\r\ncleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring\xe2\x80\x99s blush. Whose\r\nsmile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat\r\non the parsnips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And here\xe2\x80\x99s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give\r\nus a good one for the Gold cup?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re right there, Nosey Flynn said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of\r\ndisgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his\r\nwine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather\r\nwith the chill off.\r\n\r\nNice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like\r\nthe way it curves there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined\r\nmany a man, the same horses.\r\n\r\nVintners\xe2\x80\x99 sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits\r\nfor consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re in the know. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nstraight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He\xe2\x80\x99s giving\r\nSceptre today. Zinfandel\xe2\x80\x99s the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden\xe2\x80\x99s, won\r\nat Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one\r\nagainst Saint Amant a fortnight before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That so? Davy Byrne said...\r\n\r\nHe went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned\r\nits pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of\r\nhorseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,\r\nRothschild\xe2\x80\x99s filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow\r\ncap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O\xe2\x80\x99Gaunt. He put me off\r\nit. Ay.\r\n\r\nHe drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the\r\nflutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, he said, sighing.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.\r\nWill I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him\r\nforget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down\r\nagain. Cold nose he\xe2\x80\x99d have kissing a woman. Still they might like.\r\nPrickly beards they like. Dogs\xe2\x80\x99 cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the\r\nrumbling stomach\xe2\x80\x99s Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling\r\nhim in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!\r\n\r\nWine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish\r\ncheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I\xe2\x80\x99m not thirsty. Bath\r\nof course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock I can.\r\nSix. Six. Time will be gone then. She...\r\n\r\nMild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off\r\ncolour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy\r\nlobsters\xe2\x80\x99 claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of\r\nshells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the\r\nFrench eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn\r\nnothing in a thousand years. If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know risky putting anything\r\ninto your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you\r\nthink good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so\r\non. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting\r\nfruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need\r\nartificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters.\r\nUnsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too.\r\nWho found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank\r\noysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this\r\nmorning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed\r\nno June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high.\r\nTainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs\r\nfifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each\r\ndish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That\r\narchduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs?\r\nOr who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch\r\nin town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the\r\nfashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half\r\nthe catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price.\r\nCheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses.\r\nSwell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The _\xc3\xa9lite. Cr\xc3\xa8me de\r\nla cr\xc3\xa8me_. They want special dishes to pretend they\xe2\x80\x99re. Hermit with a\r\nplatter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat\r\nwith me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to\r\nvenisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow.\r\nSpread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen area. Whitehatted\r\n_chef_ like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage _\xc3\xa0 la duchesse de\r\nParme_. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself.\r\nDosing it with Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them.\r\nLobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being a\r\nwaiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I\r\ntempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do\r\nbedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat\r\nlived in Killiney, I remember. _Du de la_ is French. Still it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsame fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out\r\nof making money hand over fist finger in fishes\xe2\x80\x99 gills can\xe2\x80\x99t write his\r\nname on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth\r\ntwisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth\r\nfifty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nStuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.\r\n\r\nGlowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the\r\nwinepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun\xe2\x80\x99s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch\r\ntelling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under\r\nwild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The\r\nbay purple by the Lion\xe2\x80\x99s head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards\r\nSutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried\r\ncities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather\r\nscrub my hand under her nape, you\xe2\x80\x99ll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft\r\nwith ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not\r\nturn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her\r\nmouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and\r\nchewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.\r\nJoy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft\r\nwarm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing\r\neyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth\r\nrhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.\r\nScreened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her,\r\nkissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman\xe2\x80\x99s breasts\r\nfull in her blouse of nun\xe2\x80\x99s veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued\r\nher. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair.\r\nKissed, she kissed me.\r\n\r\nMe. And me now.\r\n\r\nStuck, the flies buzzed.\r\n\r\nHis downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.\r\nBeauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno:\r\ncurves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the\r\nround hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care what\r\nman looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like\r\nFlynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?\r\nMortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods\r\ngolden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled\r\nmutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it\r\ndrinking electricity: gods\xe2\x80\x99 food. Lovely forms of women sculped\r\nJunonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out\r\nbehind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like\r\nstoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look today. Keeper\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t see. Bend down let something fall see if she.\r\n\r\nDribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do\r\nthere to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and\r\nwalked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men\r\nlovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.\r\n\r\nWhen the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is this he is? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he in the insurance line?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for\r\nthe _Freeman._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I noticed he was in mourning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at\r\nhome. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, by God. So he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a\r\ngentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before\r\nyesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home\r\nto his better half. She\xe2\x80\x99s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He\r\nwinked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s in the craft, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg\r\nup. I was told that by a\xe2\x80\x94well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say who.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a fact?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndown. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they\xe2\x80\x99re as close\r\nas damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.\r\n\r\nDavy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find\r\nout what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and\r\nswore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint\r\nLegers of Doneraile.\r\n\r\nDavy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here\r\nand I never once saw him\xe2\x80\x94you know, over the line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God Almighty couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips\r\noff when the fun gets too hot. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see him look at his watch?\r\nAh, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he\r\ndoes he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to\r\nGod he does.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He\xe2\x80\x99s a safe man, I\xe2\x80\x99d say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He\xe2\x80\x99s been known\r\nto put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O,\r\nBloom has his good points. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing he\xe2\x80\x99ll never do.\r\n\r\nHis hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.\r\n\r\nPaddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,\r\na plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Day, Mr Byrne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Day, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThey paused at the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, what\xe2\x80\x99ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God\xe2\x80\x99 sake? What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyours, Tom?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.\r\n\r\nFor answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and\r\nhiccupped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, sir.\r\n\r\nPaddy Leonard eyed his alemates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I\xe2\x80\x99m standing drinks to! Cold\r\nwater and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.\r\nHe has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.\r\n\r\nTom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\nTom Rochford nodded and drank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it Zinfandel?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to plunge five bob on my\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell us if you\xe2\x80\x99re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard\r\nsaid. Who gave it to you?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So long! Nosey Flynn said.\r\n\r\nThe others turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take two\r\nof your small Jamesons after that and a...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth\r\nsmooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with\r\nthose R\xc3\xb6ntgen rays searchlight you could.\r\n\r\nAt Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the\r\ncobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks\r\nhaving fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom\r\ncoasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they\r\nmove. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of\r\nhis? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Lean people long\r\nmouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and\r\ninvent free. Course then you\xe2\x80\x99d have all the cranks pestering.\r\n\r\nHe hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:\r\n\r\n     Don Giovanni, a cenar teco\r\n     M\xe2\x80\x99invitasti.\r\n\r\nFeel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap\r\nin the blues. Dutch courage. That _Kilkenny People_ in the national\r\nlibrary now I must.\r\n\r\nBare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller,\r\nplumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way\r\ndown, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour\r\nround the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric\r\njuice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to\r\nstand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_A cenar teco._\r\n\r\nWhat does that _teco_ mean? Tonight perhaps.\r\n\r\n     Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited\r\n     To come to supper tonight,\r\n     The rum the rumdum.\r\n\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t go properly.\r\n\r\nKeyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be two pounds ten about\r\ntwo pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott\xe2\x80\x99s dyeworks\r\nvan over there. If I get Billy Prescott\xe2\x80\x99s ad: two fifteen. Five guineas\r\nabout. On the pig\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\nCould buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new\r\ngarters.\r\n\r\nToday. Today. Not think.\r\n\r\nTour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,\r\nMargate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely\r\nseaside girls. Against John Long\xe2\x80\x99s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy\r\nthought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.\r\nWill eat anything.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned at Gray\xe2\x80\x99s confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s window of unbought tarts and\r\npassed the reverend Thomas Connellan\xe2\x80\x99s bookstore. _Why I left the\r\nchurch of Rome? Birds\xe2\x80\x99 Nest._ Women run him. They say they used to give\r\npauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato\r\nblight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor\r\njews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.\r\n\r\nA blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No\r\ntram in sight. Wants to cross.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\nThe blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He\r\nmoved his head uncertainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.\r\nDo you want to cross? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the way.\r\n\r\nThe cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s eye followed its\r\nline and saw again the dyeworks\xe2\x80\x99 van drawn up before Drago\xe2\x80\x99s. Where I\r\nsaw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in\r\nJohn Long\xe2\x80\x99s. Slaking his drouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not moving. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\r\nacross. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to\r\nguide it forward.\r\n\r\nSay something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust\r\nwhat you tell them. Pass a common remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The rain kept off.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nStains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different\r\nfor him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child\xe2\x80\x99s hand, his hand. Like\r\nMilly\xe2\x80\x99s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if\r\nhe has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s legs: tired\r\ndrudge get his doze. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, sir.\r\n\r\nKnows I\xe2\x80\x99m a man. Voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right now? First turn to the left.\r\n\r\nThe blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing\r\nhis cane back, feeling again.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone\r\ntweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?\r\nMust have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense\r\nof volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.\r\nWonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer\r\nidea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could\r\nhe walk in a beeline if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t that cane? Bloodless pious face like\r\na fellow going in to be a priest.\r\n\r\nPenrose! That was that chap\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nLook at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.\r\nTune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a\r\ndeformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might\r\nsay. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets.\r\nPeople ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\r\nHates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.\r\n\r\nSense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched\r\ntogether. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the\r\nspring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can\xe2\x80\x99t taste wines with\r\nyour eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say\r\nget no pleasure.\r\n\r\nAnd with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl\r\npassing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have\r\nthem all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x99s eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his\r\nfingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,\r\nfor instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.\r\nThen passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nPostoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two\r\nshillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nhere too. Wait. Think over it.\r\n\r\nWith a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above\r\nhis ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt\r\nthe skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.\r\nThe belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick\r\nstreet. Perhaps to Levenston\xe2\x80\x99s dancing academy piano. Might be settling\r\nmy braces.\r\n\r\nWalking by Doran\xe2\x80\x99s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat\r\nand trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of\r\nhis belly. But I know it\xe2\x80\x99s whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nHe withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would\r\nhe have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being\r\nborn that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned\r\nand drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration\r\nfor sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.\r\nDear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can\xe2\x80\x99t cotton on to\r\nthem someway.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons\xe2\x80\x99 hall. Solemn as Troy.\r\nAfter his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a\r\nmagnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat\r\nschool. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99d turn up his nose\r\nat that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a\r\ndusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\nWellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their\r\npercentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil\r\non moneylenders. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nwhat they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers\r\nin wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nHello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.\r\nSixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s hospital. _The\r\nMessiah_ was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out\r\nthere: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a\r\nleech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.\r\n\r\nStraw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.\r\n\r\nHis heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved\r\nto the right.\r\n\r\nIs it? Almost certain. Won\xe2\x80\x99t look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too\r\nheady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.\r\n\r\nMaking for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.\r\nHandsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold\r\nstatues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.\r\n\r\nNo. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t see me. After two. Just at the gate.\r\n\r\nMy heart!\r\n\r\nHis eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir\r\nThomas Deane was the Greek architecture.\r\n\r\nLook for something I.\r\n\r\nHis hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded\r\nAgendath Netaim. Where did I?\r\n\r\nBusy looking.\r\n\r\nHe thrust back quick Agendath.\r\n\r\nAfternoon she said.\r\n\r\nI am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. _Freeman._\r\nWhere did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?\r\n\r\nHurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.\r\n\r\nHis hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap\r\nlotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.\r\n\r\nSafe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 9 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nUrbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.\r\nA great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms\r\nagainst a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in\r\nreal life.\r\n\r\nHe came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step\r\nbackward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.\r\n\r\nA noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a\r\nnoiseless beck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful\r\nineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always\r\nfeels that Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.\r\n\r\nTwicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door\r\nhe gave his large ear all to the attendant\xe2\x80\x99s words: heard them: and was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nTwo left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes\r\nbefore his death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with\r\nelder\xe2\x80\x99s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation? _The Sorrows\r\nof Satan_ he calls it.\r\n\r\nSmile. Smile Cranly\xe2\x80\x99s smile.\r\n\r\n     First he tickled her\r\n     Then he patted her\r\n     Then he passed the female catheter\r\n     For he was a medical\r\n     Jolly old medi...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the\r\nmystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.\r\n\r\nGlittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought\r\nthe face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He\r\nlaughed low: a sizar\xe2\x80\x99s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.\r\n\r\n     Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood\r\n     Tears such as angels weep.\r\n     Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.\r\n\r\nHe holds my follies hostage.\r\n\r\nCranly\xe2\x80\x99s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed\r\nKathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.\r\nAnd one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve. In the\r\nshadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul\xe2\x80\x99s youth I gave him,\r\nnight by night. God speed. Good hunting.\r\n\r\nMulligan has my telegram.\r\n\r\nFolly. Persist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a\r\nfigure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Hamlet\r\nthough I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his\r\nshadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.\r\nClergymen\xe2\x80\x99s discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal\r\nto us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a\r\nwork of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of\r\nGustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley,\r\nthe words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal\r\nwisdom, Plato\xe2\x80\x99s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of\r\nschoolboys for schoolboys.\r\n\r\nA. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike\r\nme!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.\r\nAristotle was once Plato\xe2\x80\x99s schoolboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One\r\ncan see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.\r\n\r\nHe laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.\r\n\r\nFormless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the\r\nheavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who\r\nsuffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon\r\nthe altar. I am the sacrificial butter.\r\n\r\nDunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name\r\nIneffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no\r\nsecret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to\r\nsee if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of\r\nlight, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the\r\nplane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P.\r\nmust work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very\r\nillustrious sister H.P.B.\xe2\x80\x99s elemental.\r\n\r\nO, fie! Out on\xe2\x80\x99t! _Pfuiteufel!_ You naughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to look, missus, so you\r\nnaughtn\xe2\x80\x99t when a lady\xe2\x80\x99s ashowing of her elemental.\r\n\r\nMr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with\r\ngrace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s musings about\r\nthe afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and\r\nundramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle\r\nwith Plato.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his\r\ncommonwealth?\r\n\r\nUnsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of\r\nallhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the\r\nstreet: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see.\r\nThrough spaces smaller than red globules of man\xe2\x80\x99s blood they\r\ncreepycrawl after Blake\xe2\x80\x99s buttocks into eternity of which this\r\nvegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through\r\nwhich all future plunges to the past.\r\n\r\nMr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Haines is gone, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was showing him Jubainville\xe2\x80\x99s book. He\xe2\x80\x99s quite enthusiastic, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou know, about Hyde\xe2\x80\x99s _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him in\r\nto hear the discussion. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Gill\xe2\x80\x99s to buy it.\r\n\r\n     Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick\r\n     To greet the callous public.\r\n     Writ, I ween, \xe2\x80\x99twas not my wish\r\n     In lean unlovely English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.\r\n\r\nWe feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green\r\ntwinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of\r\nRussell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the\r\nworld are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s heart on\r\nthe hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the\r\nliving mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce\r\nthe sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest\r\nflower of corruption in Mallarm\xc3\xa9 but the desirable life is revealed\r\nonly to the poor of heart, the life of Homer\xe2\x80\x99s Ph\xc3\xa6acians.\r\n\r\nFrom these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mallarm\xc3\xa9, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose\r\npoems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about\r\n_Hamlet._ He says: _il se prom\xc3\xa8ne, lisant au livre de lui-m\xc3\xaame_, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou know, _reading the book of himself_. He describes _Hamlet_ given in\r\na French town, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.\r\n\r\nHis free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.\r\n\r\n_Hamlet\r\nou\r\nLe Distrait\r\nPi\xc3\xa8ce de Shakespeare_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe repeated to John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s newgathered frown:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Pi\xc3\xa8ce de Shakespeare_, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s so French. The French\r\npoint of view. _Hamlet ou_...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but\r\ndistressingly shortsighted in some matters.\r\n\r\nSumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not\r\nfor nothing was he a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and\r\nspitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father\xe2\x80\x99s one.\r\nOur Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to shoot.\r\nThe bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the\r\nconcentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.\r\n\r\nCranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.\r\n\r\n     Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none\r\n     But we had spared...\r\n\r\nBetween the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for\r\nMr Best\xe2\x80\x99s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our\r\nflesh creep.\r\n\r\n     List! List! O List!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy flesh hears him: creeping, hears.\r\n\r\n     If thou didst ever...\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded\r\ninto impalpability through death, through absence, through change of\r\nmanners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris\r\nlies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_,\r\nreturning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.\r\n\r\nLifted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a\r\nswift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the\r\nbankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.\r\nCanvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the\r\ngroundlings.\r\n\r\nLocal colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shakespeare has left the huguenot\xe2\x80\x99s house in Silver street and walks\r\nby the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the\r\npen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon\r\nhas other thoughts.\r\n\r\nComposition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the\r\ncastoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is\r\nthe ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare\r\nwho has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not\r\nvanity in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to\r\nBurbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of\r\ncerecloth, calling him by a name:\r\n\r\n     Hamlet, I am thy father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit,\r\n\r\nbidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,\r\nyoung Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has\r\ndied in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in\r\nthe vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words\r\nto his own son\xe2\x80\x99s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been\r\nprince Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that\r\nhe did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:\r\nyou are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is\r\nthe guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nArt thou there, truepenny?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I\r\nmean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the\r\npoet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,\r\nthe poet\xe2\x80\x99s drinking, the poet\xe2\x80\x99s debts. We have _King Lear_: and it is\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nMr Best\xe2\x80\x99s face, appealed to, agreed.\r\n\r\n     Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,\r\n     Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...\r\n\r\nHow now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?\r\n\r\nMarry, I wanted it.\r\n\r\nTake thou this noble.\r\n\r\nGo to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s bed, clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter. Agenbite of inwit.\r\n\r\nDo you intend to pay it back?\r\n\r\nO, yes.\r\n\r\nWhen? Now?\r\n\r\nWell... No.\r\n\r\nWhen, then?\r\n\r\nI paid my way. I paid my way.\r\n\r\nSteady on. He\xe2\x80\x99s from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got\r\npound.\r\n\r\nBuzz. Buzz.\r\n\r\nBut I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under\r\neverchanging forms.\r\n\r\nI that sinned and prayed and fasted.\r\n\r\nA child Conmee saved from pandies.\r\n\r\nI, I and I. I.\r\n\r\nA.E.I.O.U.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?\r\nJohn Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid\r\nfor ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She\r\nsaw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She\r\nbore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids\r\nclosed when he lay on his deathbed.\r\n\r\nMother\xe2\x80\x99s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this\r\nworld lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. _Liliata\r\nrutilantium._\r\n\r\nI wept alone.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got\r\nout of it as quickly and as best he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His\r\nerrors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.\r\n\r\nPortals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,\r\nsoftcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of\r\ndiscovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn\r\nfrom Xanthippe?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts\r\ninto the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit\r\nnomen!_), Socratididion\xe2\x80\x99s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever\r\nknow. But neither the midwife\xe2\x80\x99s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him\r\nfrom the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best\xe2\x80\x99s quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem\r\nto be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.\r\n\r\nHis look went from brooder\xe2\x80\x99s beard to carper\xe2\x80\x99s skull, to remind, to\r\nchide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,\r\nguiltless though maligned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.\r\nHe carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling\r\n_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we\r\nshould know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of\r\nhounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, _Venus\r\nand Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is\r\nKatharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and\r\nbeautiful. Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a\r\npassionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose\r\nthe ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her\r\nand gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy.\r\nTheir life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He\r\nwas chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.\r\nBy cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and\r\ntwentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping\r\nto conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford\r\nwench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.\r\n\r\nAnd my turn? When?\r\n\r\nCome!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,\r\nbrightly.\r\n\r\nHe murmured then with blond delight for all:\r\n\r\n     Between the acres of the rye\r\n     These pretty countryfolk would lie.\r\n\r\nParis: the wellpleased pleaser.\r\n\r\nA tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its\r\ncooperative watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._\r\n\r\nWhither away? Exploitable ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going? John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you\r\nat Moore\xe2\x80\x99s tonight? Piper is coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?\r\n\r\nPeter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get\r\naway in time.\r\n\r\nYogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. _Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we\r\ntried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an\r\nAztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.\r\nThe faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship,\r\nringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies\r\ntend them i\xe2\x80\x99the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god,\r\nhe thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls,\r\nshesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled,\r\nwhirling, they bewail.\r\n\r\n     In quintessential triviality\r\n     For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian\r\nsaid, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering\r\ntogether a sheaf of our younger poets\xe2\x80\x99 verses. We are all looking\r\nforward anxiously.\r\n\r\nAnxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,\r\nlighted, shone.\r\n\r\nSee this. Remember.\r\n\r\nStephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his\r\nashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with\r\ntwo index fingers. Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s experiment. One or two? Necessity is\r\nthat in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.\r\nArgal, one hat is one hat.\r\n\r\nListen.\r\n\r\nYoung Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.\r\nLongworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he? I\r\nliked Colum\xe2\x80\x99s _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do\r\nyou think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: _As in wild\r\nearth a Grecian vase_. Did he? I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to come tonight.\r\nMalachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did\r\nyou hear Miss Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is\r\nMartyn\xe2\x80\x99s wild oats? Awfully clever, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? They remind one of Don\r\nQuixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr\r\nSigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful\r\ncountenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O\xe2\x80\x99Neill Russell? O,\r\nyes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James\r\nStephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it\r\nseems.\r\n\r\nCordelia. _Cordoglio._ Lir\xe2\x80\x99s loneliest daughter.\r\n\r\nNookshotten. Now your best French polish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be\r\nso kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.\r\n\r\nGod ild you. The pigs\xe2\x80\x99 paper. Bullockbefriending.\r\n\r\nSynge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too. Are we going to be\r\nread? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope\r\nyou will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.\r\n\r\nStephen sat down.\r\n\r\nThe quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.\r\n\r\nHe creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a\r\nchopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?\r\n\r\nAlarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been\r\nfirst a sundering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\r\n\r\nChristfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,\r\nfrom hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women\r\nhe won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,\r\nbully tapsters\xe2\x80\x99 wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack\r\ndishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as\r\ncinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow\r\ngrave and unforgiven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. So you think...\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind the outgoer.\r\n\r\nRest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and\r\nbrooding air.\r\n\r\nA vestal\xe2\x80\x99s lamp.\r\n\r\nHere he ponders things that were not: what C\xc3\xa6sar would have lived to do\r\nhad he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of\r\nthe possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore\r\nwhen he lived among women.\r\n\r\nCoffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.\r\nThoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice\r\nof that Egyptian highpriest. _In painted chambers loaded with\r\ntilebooks._\r\n\r\nThey are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of\r\ndeath is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak\r\ntheir will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most\r\nenigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so\r\nmuch. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind\r\nof private paper, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, of his private life. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare a button, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...\r\n\r\nHe rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his\r\ndefiance. His private papers in the original. _Ta an bad ar an tir.\r\nTaim in mo shagart_. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.\r\n\r\nQuoth littlejohn Eglinton:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I\r\nmay as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that\r\nShakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.\r\n\r\nBear with me.\r\n\r\nStephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under\r\nwrinkled brows. A basilisk. _E quando vede l\xe2\x80\x99uomo l\xe2\x80\x99attosca_. Messer\r\nBrunetto, I thank thee for the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,\r\nfrom day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the\r\nartist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast\r\nis where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of\r\nnew stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father\r\nthe image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of\r\nimagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which\r\nI was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to\r\nbe. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit\r\nhere now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.\r\n\r\nDrummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness\r\nmight be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from\r\nthe son.\r\n\r\nHas the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug\r\nin the market. The plays of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s later years which Renan\r\nadmired so much breathe another spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a\r\nsundering.\r\n\r\nSaid that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over\r\nthe hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_\r\nlook to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a\r\nman, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,\r\nprince of Tyre?\r\n\r\nHead, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant\r\nquantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they\r\nlead to the town.\r\n\r\nGood Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon\xe2\x80\x99s wild oats. Cypherjugglers\r\ngoing the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good\r\nmasters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the\r\nsun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_. Booted the twain and staved.\r\n\r\n     How many miles to Dublin?\r\n     Three score and ten, sir.\r\n     Will we be there by candlelight?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his\r\nname is, say of it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,\r\nthat which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild. _My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any\r\nman love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. _L\xe2\x80\x99art d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre\r\ngrand_...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,\r\nanother image?\r\n\r\nDo you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all\r\nmen. _Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus\r\n..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of\r\nall experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The\r\nimages of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them\r\ngrotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.\r\n\r\nThe benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of\r\nthe public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr\r\nGeorge Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles\r\non Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant. Oddly\r\nenough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of\r\nthe sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I\r\nown that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more\r\nin harmony with\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say?\xe2\x80\x94our notions of what ought not to have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nFelicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk\xe2\x80\x99s egg,\r\nprize of their fray.\r\n\r\nHe thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost\r\nlove thy man?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That may be too, Stephen said. There\xe2\x80\x99s a saying of Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s which Mr\r\nMagee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you\r\nwill get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a\r\n_buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a\r\nscandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord\r\nof language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had\r\nwritten _Romeo and Juliet_. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely\r\nkilled. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)\r\nand he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play\r\nvictoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will\r\nnot save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of\r\nthe boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew\r\nis worsted yet there remains to her woman\xe2\x80\x99s invisible weapon. There is,\r\nI feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new\r\npassion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own\r\nunderstanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages\r\ncommingle in a whirlpool.\r\n\r\nThey list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the\r\nporch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep\r\ncannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their\r\nsouls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the\r\nbeast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s ghost could not know\r\nof were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the\r\nspeech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere,\r\nbackward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with\r\nhim from Lucrece\xe2\x80\x99s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen\xe2\x80\x99s breast, bare,\r\nwith its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has\r\npiled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But,\r\nbecause loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished\r\npersonality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he\r\nhas revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind\r\nby Elsinore\xe2\x80\x99s rocks or what you will, the sea\xe2\x80\x99s voice, a voice heard\r\nonly in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son\r\nconsubstantial with the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Amen! was responded from the doorway.\r\n\r\nHast thou found me, O mine enemy?\r\n\r\n_Entr\xe2\x80\x99acte_.\r\n\r\nA ribald face, sullen as a dean\xe2\x80\x99s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then\r\nblithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he\r\nasked of Stephen.\r\n\r\nPrimrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a\r\nbauble.\r\n\r\nThey make him welcome. _Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._\r\n\r\nBrood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.\r\n\r\nHe Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,\r\nAgenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,\r\nstripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on\r\ncrosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven\r\nand there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His\r\nOwn Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and\r\ndead when all the quick shall be dead already.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells\r\naquiring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.\r\nMr Mulligan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of\r\nShakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.\r\n\r\nHe smiled on all sides equally.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan thought, puzzled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.\r\n\r\nA flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like\r\nSynge.\r\n\r\nMr Best turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He\xe2\x80\x99ll see you after at\r\nthe D. B. C. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Gill\xe2\x80\x99s to buy Hyde\xe2\x80\x99s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The bard\xe2\x80\x99s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired\r\nperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress\r\nplayed Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.\r\nVining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be\r\nan Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He\r\nswears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr Best said,\r\nlifting his brilliant notebook. That _Portrait of Mr W. H._ where he\r\nproves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all\r\nhues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.\r\n\r\nOr Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s all paradox, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the\r\ncolour, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so typical the way he works it out. It\xe2\x80\x99s the very\r\nessence of Wilde, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. The light touch.\r\n\r\nHis glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.\r\nTame essence of Wilde.\r\n\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan\r\nDeasy\xe2\x80\x99s ducats.\r\n\r\nHow much did I spend? O, a few shillings.\r\n\r\nFor a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.\r\n\r\nWit. You would give your five wits for youth\xe2\x80\x99s proud livery he pranks\r\nin. Lineaments of gratified desire.\r\n\r\nThere be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool\r\nruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.\r\n\r\nEve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.\r\nThe mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\r\n\r\nThey talked seriously of mocker\xe2\x80\x99s seriousness.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head\r\nwagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His\r\nmobile lips read, smiling with new delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!\r\n\r\nHe sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the\r\nimmense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus. Where did you\r\nlaunch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four\r\nquid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram!\r\nMalachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer!\r\nO, you priestified Kinchite!\r\n\r\nJoyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a\r\nquerulous brogue:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, mister honey, it\xe2\x80\x99s queer and sick we were,\r\nHaines and myself, the time himself brought it in. \xe2\x80\x99Twas murmur we did\r\nfor a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, and he limp with\r\nleching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting civil waiting for pints apiece.\r\n\r\nHe wailed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your\r\nconglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the\r\ndrouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.\r\n\r\nStephen laughed.\r\n\r\nQuickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard\r\nyou pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He\xe2\x80\x99s out in pampooties to\r\nmurder you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Murder you! he laughed.\r\n\r\nHarsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of\r\nlights in rue Saint-Andr\xc3\xa9-des-Arts. In words of words for words,\r\npalabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,\r\nbrandishing a winebottle. _C\xe2\x80\x99est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish. His\r\nimage, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i\xe2\x80\x99the forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his\r\n_Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms... Yes?\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and\r\noffering a card. From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the\r\n_Kilkenny People_ for last year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...\r\n\r\nHe took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,\r\nasked, creaked, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he?... O, there!\r\n\r\nBrisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked\r\nwith voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most\r\nhonest broadbrim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This gentleman? _Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal? Kilkenny People?_ To be sure. Good\r\nday, sir. _Kilkenny_... We have certainly...\r\n\r\nA patient silhouette waited, listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All the leading provincial... _Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,\r\nEnniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this\r\ngentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me...\r\nThis way... Please, sir...\r\n\r\nVoluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing\r\ndark figure following his hasty heels.\r\n\r\nThe door closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up and snatched the card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.\r\n\r\nHe rattled on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the\r\nmuseum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth\r\nthat has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to\r\nher. _Life of life, thy lips enkindle._\r\n\r\nSuddenly he turned to Stephen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker\r\nthan the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.\r\nVenus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the\r\nmaiden hid_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best\xe2\x80\x99s approval.\r\nWe begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if\r\nat all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty\r\nfrom Kyrios Menelaus\xe2\x80\x99 brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy\r\nin whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty\r\nyears he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a\r\nsalary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was\r\nrich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called\r\nit, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,\r\nhoneysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,\r\nringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a\r\nmillion francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The\r\ngombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of\r\nSheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its\r\nchaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know\r\nManningham\xe2\x80\x99s story of the burgher\xe2\x80\x99s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her\r\nbed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,\r\noverhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns\r\nand, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_. And the gay\r\nlakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady\r\nPenelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the\r\npunks of the bankside, a penny a time.\r\n\r\nCours la Reine. _Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites\r\ncochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Harry of six wives\xe2\x80\x99 daughter. And other lady friends from\r\nneighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those\r\ntwenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing\r\nbehind the diamond panes?\r\n\r\nDo and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,\r\nhe walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of\r\nJuno\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.\r\nAfar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s desk sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whom do you suspect? he challenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice\r\nspurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.\r\n\r\nLove that dare not speak its name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a\r\nlord.\r\n\r\nOld wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all\r\nother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for\r\nthe stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he\r\nhad a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a\r\nbedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost\xe2\x80\x99s mind: a broken vow and the\r\ndullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer,\r\ntwice a wooer.\r\n\r\nStephen turned boldly in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you\r\ndeny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy\r\ntell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years\r\nbetween the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those\r\nwomen saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her\r\npoor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the\r\nfirst to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her\r\nsons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Elizabeth, to use\r\ngranddaddy\xe2\x80\x99s words, wed her second, having killed her first.\r\n\r\nO, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in\r\nroyal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein\r\nhe has commended her to posterity.\r\n\r\nHe faced their silence.\r\n\r\nTo whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.\r\nBut that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.\r\nShe was entitled to her widow\xe2\x80\x99s dower\r\nAt common law. His legal knowledge was great\r\nOur judges tell us.\r\n            Him Satan fleers,\r\nMocker:\r\n            And therefore he left out her name\r\nFrom the first draft but he did not leave out\r\nThe presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,\r\nFor his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford\r\nAnd in London. And therefore when he was urged,\r\nAs I believe, to name her\r\nHe left her his\r\nSecondbest\r\nBed.\r\n\r\n            _Punkt._\r\n\r\nLeftherhis\r\nSecondbest\r\nLeftherhis\r\nBestabed\r\nSecabest\r\nLeftabed.\r\n\r\nWoa!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as\r\nthey have still if our peasant plays are true to type.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and\r\nlanded estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist\r\nshareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her\r\nhis best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in\r\npeace?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr\r\nSecondbest Best said finely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was\r\nsmiled on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.\r\nLet me think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,\r\nStephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays\r\ntribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his\r\ndead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nNell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for\r\na king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? asked Besteglinton.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare and company, limited. The people\xe2\x80\x99s William. For\r\nterms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought\r\nof the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his\r\nhands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those\r\ndays._ Lovely!\r\n\r\nCatamite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to\r\nugling Eglinton.\r\n\r\nSteadfast John replied severe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake\r\nand have it.\r\n\r\nSayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his\r\nown long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself\r\na cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the\r\nfamine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship\r\nmentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.\r\nHe sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted\r\nhis pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could\r\nAubrey\xe2\x80\x99s ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to\r\nhis mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging\r\nand quartering of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s leech Lopez, his jew\xe2\x80\x99s heart being\r\nplucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_\r\nwith the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn\r\nfor witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in _Love\xe2\x80\x99s Labour Lost_.\r\nHis pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking\r\nenthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheory of equivocation. The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and\r\nthe play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American\r\ncousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney\xe2\x80\x99s. As for fay Elizabeth,\r\notherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives\r\nof Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for\r\ndeephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.\r\n\r\nI think you\xe2\x80\x99re getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of\r\ntheolologicophilolological. _Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your dean\r\nof studies holds he was a holy Roman.\r\n\r\n_Sufflaminandus sum._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French\r\npolisher of Italian scandals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him\r\nmyriadminded.\r\n\r\n_Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit\r\namicitia inter multos._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Saint Thomas, Stephen began...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.\r\n\r\nThere he keened a wailing rune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed we are from this day!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed we are surely!\r\n\r\nAll smiled their smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy\r\nreading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different\r\nfrom that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in\r\nhis wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that\r\nthe love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some\r\nstranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with\r\navarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations\r\nare made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the\r\njews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their\r\naffections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues\r\nold Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so\r\ntightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will\r\nhold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls\r\nhis wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his\r\nmanservant or his maidservant or his jackass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow, is the will to die.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.\r\n\r\n     What of all the will to do?\r\n     It has vanished long ago...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the\r\nmobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as\r\nrare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of\r\nseven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed\r\nwith her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid\r\nfor but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a\r\nsoul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the\r\n_Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she\r\nthought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers\xe2\x80\x99 Breeches_ and _The most\r\nSpiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_. Venus has\r\ntwisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.\r\nIt is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_. The\r\nages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that\r\nRussell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say\r\nthat only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family\r\nman. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.\r\n\r\nLean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping\r\nwith the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it\r\nhim. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman to see you. Me? Says he\xe2\x80\x99s your father, sir. Give me my\r\nWordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in\r\nstrossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with\r\nclauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.\r\n\r\nYour own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.\r\n\r\nHurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I\r\ntouched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is\r\nattending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary\r\nevil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\nIf you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,\r\nwith thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,\r\nwith fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from\r\nWittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the\r\nlustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the\r\nnight. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of\r\nfatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.\r\nBoccaccio\xe2\x80\x99s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with\r\nchild. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to\r\nman. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only\r\nbegetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which\r\nthe cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is\r\nfounded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro\r\nand microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.\r\n_Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true\r\nthing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of\r\nany son that any son should love him or he any son?\r\n\r\nWhat the hell are you driving at?\r\n\r\nI know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.\r\n\r\n_Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea._\r\n\r\nAre you condemned to do this?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal\r\nannals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,\r\nhardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,\r\nlesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with\r\ngrandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son\r\nunborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases\r\ncare. He is a new male: his growth is his father\xe2\x80\x99s decline, his youth\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s envy, his friend his father\xe2\x80\x99s enemy.\r\n\r\nIn rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.\r\n\r\nAm I a father? If I were?\r\n\r\nShrunken uncertain hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the\r\nfield, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of\r\nAquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the\r\nfather who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a\r\nfather be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another\r\npoet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not\r\nthe father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and\r\nfelt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own\r\ngrandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,\r\nnever was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nEglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly\r\nglancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.\r\n\r\nFlatter. Rarely. But flatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with\r\nchild. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The\r\nplay\xe2\x80\x99s the thing! Let me parturiate!\r\n\r\nHe clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As for his family, Stephen said, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name lives in the forest\r\nof Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in\r\n_Coriolanus._ His boyson\xe2\x80\x99s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in\r\n_King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the\r\ngirls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter\xe2\x80\x99s Tale_ are we know.\r\nWho Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may\r\nguess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.\r\n\r\nThe quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with\r\nhaste, quake, quack.\r\n\r\nDoor closed. Cell. Day.\r\n\r\nThey list. Three. They.\r\n\r\nI you he they.\r\n\r\nCome, mess.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in\r\nhis old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister\r\nGatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the\r\nplaywriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on\xe2\x80\x99s back. The\r\nplayhouse sausage filled Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund\r\nand a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.\r\n\r\nMAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?\r\n\r\nBEST: That is my name, Richard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. I hope you are going to\r\nsay a good word for Richard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, for my sake. _(Laughter)_\r\n\r\nBUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)\r\n\r\n     Then outspoke medical Dick\r\n     To his comrade medical Davy...\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,\r\nRichard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnames. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his\r\nbrother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.\r\n\r\nBEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want Richard, my name\r\n...\r\n\r\n_(Laughter)_\r\n\r\nQUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,\r\nWilliam, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old\r\nItaly set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it\r\nin the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o\xe2\x80\x99Gaunt his\r\nname is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a\r\nbend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus,\r\ndearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\na name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the\r\nname that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at\r\nhis birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in\r\nthe night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the\r\nrecumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the\r\nstars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the\r\nbear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight\r\nreturning from Shottery and from her arms.\r\n\r\nBoth satisfied. I too.\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.\r\n\r\nAnd from her arms.\r\n\r\nWait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?\r\n\r\nRead the skies. _Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nconfiguration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: _sua donna.\r\nGi\xc3\xa0: di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amare S. D._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a\r\ncelestial phenomenon?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.\r\n\r\nWhat more\xe2\x80\x99s to speak?\r\n\r\nStephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.\r\n\r\n_Stephanos,_ my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my\r\nfeet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is\r\nstrange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.\r\n\r\nMe, Magee and Mulligan.\r\n\r\nFabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?\r\nNewhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.\r\n_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nMr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting because that brother motive, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\r\nwe find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three\r\nbrothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, the fairytales. The\r\nthird brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best\r\nprize.\r\n\r\nBest of Best brothers. Good, better, best.\r\n\r\nThe quaker librarian springhalted near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you\r\nto suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps\r\nI am anticipating?\r\n\r\nHe caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.\r\n\r\nAn attendant from the doorway called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Father Dineen! Directly.\r\n\r\nSwiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton touched the foil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.\r\nYou kept them for the last, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and\r\nnuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A\r\nbrother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.\r\n\r\nLapwing.\r\n\r\nWhere is your brother? Apothecaries\xe2\x80\x99 hall. My whetstone. Him, then\r\nCranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They\r\nmock to try you. Act. Be acted on.\r\n\r\nLapwing.\r\n\r\nI am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.\r\n\r\nOn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he\r\ntook the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?\r\nRichard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann\r\n(what\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard\r\nthe conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The\r\nother four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his\r\nkings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s reverence,\r\nthe angel of the world. Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which\r\nEdmund figures lifted out of Sidney\xe2\x80\x99s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to\r\na Celtic legend older than history?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That was Will\xe2\x80\x99s way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine\r\na Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. _Que\r\nvoulez-vous?_ Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and\r\nmakes Ulysses quote Aristotle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the\r\nusurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to\r\nShakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of\r\nbanishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds\r\nuninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero\r\nbreaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his\r\nbook. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in\r\nanother, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.\r\nIt repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married\r\ndaughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it\r\nwas the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will\r\nand left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my\r\nlords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,\r\ncommitted by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the\r\nlines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under\r\nwhich her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it.\r\nBeauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety\r\neverywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,\r\ntwice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure\r\nfor Measure_\xe2\x80\x94and in all the other plays which I have not read.\r\n\r\nHe laughed to free his mind from his mind\xe2\x80\x99s bondage.\r\n\r\nJudge Eglinton summed up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He\r\nis all in all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.\r\nAll in all. In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold. He\r\nacts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jos\xc3\xa9 he\r\nkills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago\r\nceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!\r\n\r\nDark dome received, reverbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When\r\nall is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _p\xc3\xa8re?)_ is right. After God\r\nShakespeare has created most.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after\r\na life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has\r\nalways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of\r\nlife ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The\r\nmotion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet _p\xc3\xa8re_ and Hamlet _fils._ A\r\nking and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what\r\nthough murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,\r\nDane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom\r\nthey refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it:\r\nprosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa\xe2\x80\x99s lump of\r\nlove, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the\r\nplace where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world\r\nwithout as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck\r\nsays: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated\r\non his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps\r\nwill tend._ Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through\r\nourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,\r\nwidows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright\r\nwho wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light\r\nfirst and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom\r\nthe most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless\r\nall in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and\r\ncuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet,\r\nthere are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being\r\na wife unto himself.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried. _Eureka!_\r\n\r\nSuddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.\r\n\r\nHe began to scribble on a slip of paper.\r\n\r\nTake some slips from the counter going out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,\r\nshall live. The rest shall keep as they are.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.\r\n\r\nUnwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his\r\nvariorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have\r\nbrought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe\r\nyour own theory?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Stephen said promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a\r\ndialogue, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.\r\n\r\nJohn Eclecticon doubly smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, in that case, he said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should expect payment\r\nfor it since you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is\r\nsome mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man\r\nPiper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes\r\nthat the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to\r\nvisit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor\r\nwrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he\r\nbelieves his theory.\r\n\r\nI believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or\r\nhelp me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? _Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?\r\nOther chap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.\r\nThen I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an\r\narticle on economics.\r\n\r\nFraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then\r\ngravely said, honeying malice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper\r\nMecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa\r\ncontra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly\r\nand Rosalie, the coalquay whore.\r\n\r\nHe broke away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, Kinch. Come, wandering \xc3\x86ngus of the birds.\r\n\r\nCome, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts\r\nand offals.\r\n\r\nStephen rose.\r\n\r\nLife is many days. This will end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. _Notre ami_ Moore says\r\nMalachi Mulligan must be there.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of\r\nIreland. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk\r\nstraight?\r\n\r\nLaughing, he...\r\n\r\nSwill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.\r\n\r\nLubber...\r\n\r\nStephen followed a lubber...\r\n\r\nOne day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His\r\nlub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.\r\n\r\nStephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a\r\nwellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering\r\ndaylight of no thought.\r\n\r\nWhat have I learned? Of them? Of me?\r\n\r\nWalk like Haines now.\r\n\r\nThe constant readers\xe2\x80\x99 room. In the readers\xe2\x80\x99 book Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\r\nFitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet\r\nmad? The quaker\xe2\x80\x99s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...\r\n\r\nAmused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,\r\nselfnodding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A pleased bottom.\r\n\r\nThe turnstile.\r\n\r\nIs that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...\r\n\r\nThe curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.\r\n\r\nPuck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:\r\n\r\n     John Eglinton, my jo, John,\r\n     Why won\xe2\x80\x99t you wed a wife?\r\n\r\nHe spluttered to the air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their\r\nplaybox, Haines and I, the plumbers\xe2\x80\x99 hall. Our players are creating a\r\nnew art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I\r\nsmell the pubic sweat of monks.\r\n\r\nHe spat blank.\r\n\r\nForgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And\r\nleft the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born? And his\r\nfirst child a girl?\r\n\r\nAfterwit. Go back.\r\n\r\nThe dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,\r\nminion of pleasure, Phedo\xe2\x80\x99s toyable fair hair.\r\n\r\nEh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Longworth and M\xe2\x80\x99Curdy Atkinson were there...\r\n\r\nPuck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:\r\n\r\n     I hardly hear the purlieu cry\r\n     Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by\r\n     Before my thoughts begin to run\r\n     On F. M\xe2\x80\x99Curdy Atkinson,\r\n     The same that had the wooden leg\r\n     And that filibustering filibeg\r\n     That never dared to slake his drouth,\r\n     Magee that had the chinless mouth.\r\n     Being afraid to marry on earth\r\n     They masturbated for all they were worth.\r\n\r\nJest on. Know thyself.\r\n\r\nHalted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing\r\nblack to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nA laugh tripped over his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that\r\nold hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a\r\njob on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you do the Yeats touch?\r\n\r\nHe went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.\r\nOne thinks of Homer.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the stairfoot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmorrice with caps of indices.\r\n\r\nIn sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:\r\n\r\n_Everyman His Own Wife\r\nor\r\nA Honeymoon in the Hand\r\n(a national immorality in three orgasms)\r\nby\r\nBallocky Mulligan._\r\n\r\n\r\nHe turned a happy patch\xe2\x80\x99s smirk to Stephen, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.\r\n\r\nHe read, _marcato:_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Characters:\r\n\r\n     TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)\r\n     CRAB (a bushranger)\r\n     MEDICAL DICK )\r\n         and      ) (two birds with one stone)\r\n     MEDICAL DAVY )\r\n     MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)\r\n     FRESH NELLY\r\n         and\r\n     ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).\r\n\r\nHe laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:\r\nand mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift\r\ntheir skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,\r\nmulticoloured, multitudinous vomit!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAbout to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.\r\n\r\nPart. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,\r\nif Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must\r\ncome to, ineluctably.\r\n\r\nMy will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.\r\n\r\nA man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nThe portico.\r\n\r\nHere I watched the birds for augury. \xc3\x86ngus of the birds. They go, they\r\ncome. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots\r\nafter. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown\xe2\x80\x99s awe. Did you\r\nsee his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient\r\nmariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.\r\n\r\nManner of Oxenford.\r\n\r\nDay. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.\r\n\r\nA dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,\r\nunder portcullis barbs.\r\n\r\nThey followed.\r\n\r\nOffend me still. Speak on.\r\n\r\nKind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds.\r\nFrail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in\r\na flaw of softness softly were blown.\r\n\r\nCease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:\r\nfrom wide earth an altar.\r\n\r\n            Laud we the gods\r\n     And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\r\n     From our bless\xe2\x80\x99d altars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 10 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth\r\nwatch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five\r\nto three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nagain? Dignam. Yes. _Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the\r\nperson to see. Mr Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible.\r\nGood practical catholic: useful at mission time.\r\n\r\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his\r\ncrutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the\r\nsisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very\r\nreverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his\r\npurse held, he knew, one silver crown.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,\r\nof soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,\r\nending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey\xe2\x80\x99s words:\r\n_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have\r\nabandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of\r\nsunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy\r\nM.P.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\r\n\r\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton\r\nprobably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at\r\nBelvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear\r\nthat. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still\r\nsitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful\r\nindeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would\r\ncome again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man\r\nreally.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\r\nIooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.\r\nYes, he would certainly call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the\r\njet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,\r\nin going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father\r\nBernard Vaughan\xe2\x80\x99s droll eyes and cockney voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pilate! Wy don\xe2\x80\x99t you old back that owlin mob?\r\n\r\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his\r\nway. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.\r\nOf good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\r\n\r\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy\r\nsquare. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were\r\nthey good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his\r\nname? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little\r\nman? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and\r\npointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\r\n\r\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\r\n\r\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nto father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father\r\nConmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square\r\neast.\r\n\r\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate\r\nfrockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender\r\ntrousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave\r\ndeportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady\r\nMaxwell at the corner of Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\n\r\nWas that not Mrs M\xe2\x80\x99Guinness?\r\n\r\nMrs M\xe2\x80\x99Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the\r\nfarther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and\r\nsaluted. How did she do?\r\n\r\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to\r\nthink that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he\r\nsay?... such a queenly mien.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the\r\nshutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will\r\n(D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on\r\nhim to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible\r\nignorance. They acted according to their lights.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular\r\nroad. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an\r\nimportant thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\r\n\r\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All\r\nraised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.\r\nChristian brother boys.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father\r\nConmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but\r\noccasionally they were also badtempered.\r\n\r\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift\r\nnobleman. And now it was an office or something.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted\r\nby Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father\r\nConmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came\r\nfrom baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nTobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful\r\ncatastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually\r\nhappening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an\r\nact of perfect contrition.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin\xe2\x80\x99s publichouse against the window of\r\nwhich two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s funeral establishment where Corny\r\nKelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.\r\nA constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted\r\nthe constable. In Youkstetter\xe2\x80\x99s, the porkbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s, Father Conmee\r\nobserved pig\xe2\x80\x99s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a\r\nturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty\r\nstraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above\r\nhim. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of\r\nthe Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out\r\nand bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis\r\nXavier\xe2\x80\x99s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound\r\ntram.\r\n\r\nOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of\r\nsaint Agatha\xe2\x80\x99s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\r\n\r\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for\r\nhe disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with\r\ncare in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a\r\nsixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into\r\nhis purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket\r\ninspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away\r\nthe ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father\r\nConmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked\r\ncheerful decorum.\r\n\r\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father\r\nConmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee\r\nsupposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman\r\nwith the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so\r\ngently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and\r\nsmiled tinily, sweetly.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that\r\nthe awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the\r\nmouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\r\n\r\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old\r\nwoman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the\r\nbellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a\r\nmarketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and\r\nbasket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed\r\nthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had\r\nalways to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been\r\nabsolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many\r\ncares, poor creatures.\r\n\r\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at\r\nFather Conmee.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men\r\nand of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission\r\nand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and\r\nbrown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when\r\ntheir last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the\r\nBelgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des \xc3\x89lus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a\r\nreasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in\r\nHis Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But\r\nthey were God\xe2\x80\x99s souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a\r\npity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.\r\n\r\nAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the\r\nconductor and saluted in his turn.\r\n\r\nThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.\r\nThe joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,\r\nimmediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.\r\nThen came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.\r\nThose were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old\r\ntimes in the barony.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the\r\nBarony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and\r\nof Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of\r\nBelvedere.\r\n\r\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,\r\nMary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,\r\nnot startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the\r\njealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed\r\nadultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned\r\nas women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however\r\nfor man\xe2\x80\x99s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our\r\nways.\r\n\r\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and\r\nhonoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at\r\nsmiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit\r\nclusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,\r\nwere impalmed by Don John Conmee.\r\n\r\nIt was a charming day.\r\n\r\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,\r\ncurtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of\r\nsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French\r\nsaid. A just and homely word.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds\r\nover Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of\r\nClongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the\r\ncries of the boys\xe2\x80\x99 lines at their play, young cries in the quiet\r\nevening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.\r\nAn ivory bookmark told him the page.\r\n\r\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.\r\n_Deus in adiutorium._\r\n\r\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he\r\ncame to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:\r\nin eternum omnia iudicia iustiti\xc3\xa6 tu\xc3\xa6._\r\n\r\nA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a\r\nyoung woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised\r\nhis cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care\r\ndetached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his\r\nbreviary. _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis\r\nformidavit cor meum._\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping\r\neye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,\r\nwent to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass\r\nfurnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came\r\nto the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes\r\nand leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.\r\n\r\nFather John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat\r\ndowntilted, chewing his blade of hay.\r\n\r\nConstable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Corny Kelleher said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s very close, the constable said.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth\r\nwhile a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s the best news? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with\r\nbated breath.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nA onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s corner, skirting\r\nRabaiotti\xe2\x80\x99s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards\r\nLarry O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_For England_...\r\n\r\nHe swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted\r\nand growled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_home and beauty._\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in\r\nthe warehouse with a visitor.\r\n\r\nA stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it\r\ninto the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced\r\nsourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself\r\nforward four strides.\r\n\r\nHe halted and growled angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_For England_...\r\n\r\nTwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,\r\ngaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.\r\n\r\nHe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head\r\ntowards a window and bayed deeply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_home and beauty._\r\n\r\nThe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.\r\nThe blind of the window was drawn aside. A card _Unfurnished\r\nApartments_ slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm\r\nshone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut\r\nshiftstraps. A woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.\r\nIt fell on the path.\r\n\r\nOne of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the\r\nminstrel\xe2\x80\x99s cap, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There, sir.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nKatey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you put in the books? Boody asked.\r\n\r\nMaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds\r\ntwice with her potstick and wiped her brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give anything on them, she said.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles\r\ntickled by stubble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where did you try? Boody asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x99Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBoody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bad cess to her big face! she cried.\r\n\r\nKatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s in the pot? she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shirts, Maggy said.\r\n\r\nBoody cried angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?\r\n\r\nKatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what\xe2\x80\x99s in this?\r\n\r\nA heavy fume gushed in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Peasoup, Maggy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where did you get it? Katey asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey rang his bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barang!\r\n\r\nBoody sat down at the table and said hungrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us it here.\r\n\r\nMaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,\r\nsitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her\r\nmouth random crumbs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A good job we have that much. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Dilly?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gone to meet father, Maggy said.\r\n\r\nBoody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our father who art not in heaven.\r\n\r\nMaggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey\xe2\x80\x99s bowl, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Boody! For shame!\r\n\r\nA skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the\r\nLiffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed\r\naround the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,\r\nbetween the Customhouse old dock and George\xe2\x80\x99s quay.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blond girl in Thornton\xe2\x80\x99s bedded the wicker basket with rustling\r\nfibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper\r\nand a small jar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Put these in first, will you? he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.\r\n\r\nShe bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe\r\nshamefaced peaches.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the\r\nfruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red\r\ntomatoes, sniffing smells.\r\n\r\nH. E. L. Y.\xe2\x80\x99S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,\r\nplodding towards their goal.\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from\r\nhis fob and held it at its chain\xe2\x80\x99s length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can you send them by tram? Now?\r\n\r\nA darkbacked figure under Merchants\xe2\x80\x99 arch scanned books on the hawker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.\r\n\r\nThe blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you write the address, sir?\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Send it at once, will you? he said. It\xe2\x80\x99s for an invalid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. I will, sir.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s the damage? he asked.\r\n\r\nThe blond girl\xe2\x80\x99s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He\r\ntook a red carnation from the tall stemglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This for me? he asked gallantly.\r\n\r\nThe blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie\r\na bit crooked, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, she said.\r\n\r\nBending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the\r\nred flower between his smiling teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.\r\n\r\nHe gazed over Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder at Goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s knobby poll.\r\n\r\nTwo carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,\r\ngripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men\xe2\x80\x99s arms frankly round their\r\nstunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of\r\nthe bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Anch\xe2\x80\x99io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand\xe2\x80\x99 ero\r\ngiovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo \xc3\xa8 una bestia. \xc3\x88\r\npeccato. Perch\xc3\xa8 la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.\r\nInvece, Lei si sacrifica._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in\r\nslow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. _Ma, dia retta\r\na me. Ci rifletta_.\r\n\r\nBy the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram\r\nunloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Ci rifletter\xc3\xb2,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.\r\n\r\nHis heavy hand took Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously\r\nan instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. _Venga a trovarmi\r\ne ci pensi. Addio, caro._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand\r\nwas freed. _E grazie._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said. _Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!_\r\n\r\nAlmidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,\r\ntrotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,\r\nsignalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling\r\nimplements of music through Trinity gates.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_\r\nfar back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her\r\ntypewriter.\r\n\r\nToo much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?\r\nChange it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.\r\n\r\nThe disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:\r\nsix.\r\n\r\nMiss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9416 June 1904.\r\n\r\nFive tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny\xe2\x80\x99s corner and the slab\r\nwhere Wolfe Tone\xe2\x80\x99s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L.\r\nY.\xe2\x80\x99S and plodded back as they had come.\r\n\r\nThen she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming\r\nsoubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens\r\nand capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nnicelooking, is she? The way she\xe2\x80\x99s holding up her bit of a skirt.\r\nWonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that\r\ndressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s. They kick out\r\ngrand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.\r\nHope to goodness he won\xe2\x80\x99t keep me here till seven.\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang rudely by her ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring them up after five. Only\r\nthose two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can\r\ngo after six if you\xe2\x80\x99re not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven\r\nand six. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.\r\n\r\nShe scribbled three figures on an envelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.\r\nMr Lenehan, yes. He said he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes,\r\nsir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring them up after five.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his\r\npliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe vesta in the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long\r\nsoft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and\r\nmouldy air closed round them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic\r\ncouncil chamber of saint Mary\xe2\x80\x99s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed\r\nhimself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.\r\nThe old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and\r\nthe original jews\xe2\x80\x99 temple was here too before they built their\r\nsynagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were\r\nyou?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory\r\nserves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Ned Lambert said. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite right, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to\r\nallow me perhaps...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here\r\nor from here.\r\n\r\nIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the\r\npiled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\r\n\r\nFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won\xe2\x80\x99t trespass\r\non your valuable time...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next\r\nweek, say. Can you see?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.\r\n\r\nHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away\r\namong the pillars. With J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut\r\nmeal, O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Wexford.\r\n\r\nHe stood to read the card in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He\xe2\x80\x99s writing a book about\r\nthe Fitzgeralds he told me. He\xe2\x80\x99s well up in history, faith.\r\n\r\nThe young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging\r\ntwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare\r\nafter he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? _I\xe2\x80\x99m bloody\r\nsorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the\r\narchbishop was inside._ He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, though. What? God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot\r\nmembers they were all of them, the Geraldines.\r\n\r\nThe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He\r\nslapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Woa, sonny!\r\n\r\nHe turned to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, Jack. What is it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.\r\n\r\nWith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an\r\ninstant, sneezed loudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Chow! he said. Blast you!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The dust from those sacks, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your\r\nsoul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of\r\ndraught...\r\n\r\nHe held his handkerchief ready for the coming...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call\r\nhim... Chow!... Mother of Moses!\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his\r\nclaret waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See? he said. Say it\xe2\x80\x99s turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.\r\n\r\nHe slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove,\r\nwobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.\r\n\r\nLawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the\r\nconsolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying\r\nthe costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the\r\nadmiralty division of king\xe2\x80\x99s bench to the court of appeal an elderly\r\nfemale with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of\r\ngreat amplitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.\r\nThe impact. Leverage, see?\r\n\r\nHe showed them the rising column of disks on the right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late\r\ncan see what turn is on and what turns are over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See? Tom Rochford said.\r\n\r\nHe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,\r\nstop: four. Turn Now On.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good\r\nturn deserves another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m Boylan with impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Goodnight, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said abruptly. When you two begin...\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.\r\n\r\nHe followed M\xe2\x80\x99Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a hero, he said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. The drain, you mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.\r\n\r\nThey passed Dan Lowry\xe2\x80\x99s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming\r\nsoubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.\r\n\r\nGoing down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall\r\nLenehan showed M\xe2\x80\x99Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes\r\nlike a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it,\r\nhalf choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky\xe2\x80\x99s vest\r\nand all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope\r\nround the poor devil and the two were hauled up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The act of a hero, he said.\r\n\r\nAt the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past\r\nthem for Jervis street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nsee Sceptre\xe2\x80\x99s starting price. What\xe2\x80\x99s the time by your gold watch and\r\nchain?\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses\xe2\x80\x99 sombre office, then at\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After three, he said. Who\xe2\x80\x99s riding her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.\r\n\r\nWhile he waited in Temple bar M\xe2\x80\x99Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle\r\npushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy\r\nget a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal\r\ncavalcade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in\r\nthere going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t an\r\nearthly. Through here.\r\n\r\nThey went up the steps and under Merchants\xe2\x80\x99 arch. A darkbacked figure\r\nscanned books on the hawker\xe2\x80\x99s cart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, Lenehan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wonder what he\xe2\x80\x99s buying, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said, glancing behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s dead nuts on sales, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. I was with him one day and he\r\nbought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were\r\nfine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and\r\ncomets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.\r\n\r\nLenehan laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a damn good one about comets\xe2\x80\x99 tails, he said. Come over\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\nThey crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the\r\nriverwall.\r\n\r\nMaster Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan\xe2\x80\x99s, late Fehrenbach\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ncarrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said\r\neagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord\r\nmayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan\r\nDawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d\xe2\x80\x99Arcy sang and Benjamin\r\nDollard...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did she? Lenehan said.\r\n\r\nA card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number\r\n7 Eccles street.\r\n\r\nHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the\r\ncatering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife\r\nwere there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and\r\ncuracoa to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After\r\nliquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. The year the missus was there...\r\n\r\nLenehan linked his arm warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after\r\nall the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o\xe2\x80\x99clock the\r\nmorning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnight on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one\r\nside of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started\r\nsinging glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_. She was well\r\nprimed with a good load of Delahunt\xe2\x80\x99s port under her bellyband. Every\r\njolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.\r\n\r\nHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.\r\nKnow what I mean?\r\n\r\nHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in\r\ndelight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She\xe2\x80\x99s a gamey\r\nmare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the\r\ncomets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear\r\nand Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I\r\nwas lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At\r\nlast she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. _And what star is that,\r\nPoldy?_ says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. _That one, is it?_\r\nsays Chris Callinan, _sure that\xe2\x80\x99s only what you might call a pinprick._\r\nBy God, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far wide of the mark.\r\n\r\nLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m weak, he gasped.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan\r\nwalked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead\r\nrapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He\xe2\x80\x99s not one\r\nof your common or garden... you know... There\xe2\x80\x99s a touch of the artist\r\nabout old Bloom.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria\r\nMonk_, then of Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.\r\nPlates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of\r\nslaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the\r\nworld. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every\r\nminute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.\r\n\r\nHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the\r\nGhetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That I had, he said, pushing it by.\r\n\r\nThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Them are two good ones, he said.\r\n\r\nOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.\r\nHe bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his\r\nunbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\r\n\r\nOn O\xe2\x80\x99Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay\r\napparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. _Fair Tyrants_ by James\r\nLovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.\r\n\r\nHe opened it. Thought so.\r\n\r\nA woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.\r\n\r\nNo: she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that much. Got her it once.\r\n\r\nHe read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_. More in her line. Let us see.\r\n\r\nHe read where his finger opened.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on\r\nwondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!_\r\n\r\nYes. This. Here. Try.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands\r\nfelt for the opulent curves inside her d\xc3\xa9shabill\xc3\xa9._\r\n\r\nYes. Take this. The end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her\r\nqueenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played\r\nround her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._\r\n\r\nWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply\r\namid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched\r\nthemselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).\r\nArmpits\xe2\x80\x99 oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).\r\nFeel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!\r\n\r\nYoung! Young!\r\n\r\nAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of\r\nchancery, king\xe2\x80\x99s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the\r\nlord chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the\r\nadmiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the\r\nLady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of\r\nappeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean\r\nAccident and Guarantee Corporation.\r\n\r\nPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy\r\ncurtains. The shopman\xe2\x80\x99s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven\r\nreddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on\r\nthe floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along\r\nit, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom beheld it.\r\n\r\nMastering his troubled breath, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this one.\r\n\r\nThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good one.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lacquey by the door of Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s auctionrooms shook his handbell\r\ntwice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,\r\nthe cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely\r\ncurtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas.\r\nAny advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barang!\r\n\r\nBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.\r\nJ. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched\r\nnecks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams\xe2\x80\x99s row.\r\nHe halted near his daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s time for you, she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are\r\nyou trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon\r\nshoulder? Melancholy God!\r\n\r\nDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and\r\nheld them back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stand up straight, girl, he said. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get curvature of the spine.\r\nDo you know what you look like?\r\n\r\nHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders\r\nand dropping his underjaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you get any money? Dilly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin\r\nwould lend me fourpence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along\r\nJames\xe2\x80\x99s street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns\r\ntaught you to be so saucy? Here.\r\n\r\nHe handed her a shilling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See if you can do anything with that, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You\xe2\x80\x99re like the rest of\r\nthem, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor\r\nmother died. But wait awhile. You\xe2\x80\x99ll all get a short shrift and a long\r\nday from me. Low blackguardism! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get rid of you. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare if I was stretched out stiff. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead. The man upstairs is dead.\r\n\r\nHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, what is it? he said, stopping.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barang!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell\r\nbut feebly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bang!\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus stared at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Watch him, he said. It\xe2\x80\x99s instructive. I wonder will he allow us to\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You got more than that, father, Dilly said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you\r\nall where Jesus left the jews. Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s all I have. I got two\r\nshillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can\xe2\x80\x99t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus thought and nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O\xe2\x80\x99Connell\r\nstreet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try this one now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk\r\nfor yourself and a bun or a something. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be home shortly.\r\n\r\nHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.\r\n\r\nThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of\r\nParkgate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey banged loudly.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing\r\nmincing mouth gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nanything! O, sure they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really! Is it little sister Monica!\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the sundial towards James\xe2\x80\x99s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with\r\nthe order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstreet, past Shackleton\xe2\x80\x99s offices. Got round him all right. How do you\r\ndo, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your\r\nother establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping\r\nalive. Lovely weather we\xe2\x80\x99re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country.\r\nThose farmers are always grumbling. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a thimbleful of your\r\nbest gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that\r\n_General Slocum_ explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.\r\nAnd heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most\r\nbrutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion.\r\nMost scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the\r\nfirehose all burst. What I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand is how the inspectors ever\r\nallowed a boat like that... Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.\r\nYou know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look\r\nat that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we\r\nwere bad here.\r\n\r\nI smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is\r\nit? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true?_\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\r\n\r\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there\xe2\x80\x99s money going there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways someone to pick it up.\r\n\r\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy\r\nappearance. Bowls them over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter\r\nKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson\r\nstreet. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built\r\nunder three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street\r\nclub toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian\r\nbank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he\r\nremembered me.\r\n\r\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.\r\nGentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom\r\nagain, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying\r\nhas it.\r\n\r\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson\xe2\x80\x99s quay, with hulls and anchorchains,\r\nsailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on\r\nthe ferrywash, Elijah is coming.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.\r\nGrizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy\r\nbody forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned\r\nLambert\xe2\x80\x99s brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He\xe2\x80\x99s as like it as damn\r\nit. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash\r\nlike that. Damn like him.\r\n\r\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.\r\nGood drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to\r\nhis fat strut.\r\n\r\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.\r\nDogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\ndrove by in her noddy.\r\n\r\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.\r\nFourbottle men.\r\n\r\nLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan\xe2\x80\x99s? Or no, there was a midnight\r\nburial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the\r\nwall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn\r\ndown here. Make a detour.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the\r\ncorner of Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s visitors\xe2\x80\x99 waitingroom. Outside the Dublin\r\nDistillers Company\xe2\x80\x99s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey\r\nstood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some\r\nTipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nDenis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John\r\nHenry Menton\xe2\x80\x99s office, led his wife over O\xe2\x80\x99Connell bridge, bound for\r\nthe office of Messrs Collis and Ward.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan approached Island street.\r\n\r\nTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those\r\nreminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now\r\nin a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly\xe2\x80\x99s. No\r\ncardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the\r\ntable by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from\r\nmajor Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.\r\n\r\nDamn good gin that was.\r\n\r\nFine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that\r\nsham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on\r\nthe wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is:\r\nIngram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad\r\ntouchingly. Masterly rendition.\r\n\r\n_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._\r\n\r\nA cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,\r\nleaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a\r\npity!\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the\r\nshowtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.\r\nDust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on\r\nrubies, leprous and winedark stones.\r\n\r\nBorn all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights\r\nshining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of\r\ntheir brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nShe dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,\r\nrustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed\r\nsilent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her\r\nhips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.\r\n\r\nOld Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned\r\nit and held it at the point of his Moses\xe2\x80\x99 beard. Grandfather ape\r\ngloating on a stolen hoard.\r\n\r\nAnd you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words\r\nof sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat\r\nstanding from everlasting to everlasting.\r\n\r\nTwo old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through\r\nIrishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,\r\none with a midwife\xe2\x80\x99s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\r\n\r\nThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the\r\npowerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always\r\nwithout you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I\r\nbetween them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.\r\nShatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me\r\nyou who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A\r\nlook around.\r\n\r\nYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You\r\nsay right, sir. A Monday morning, \xe2\x80\x99twas so, indeed.\r\n\r\nStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against\r\nhis shoulderblade. In Clohissey\xe2\x80\x99s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan\r\nboxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood\r\nround the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths\r\nproposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are\r\nthrobbing: heroes\xe2\x80\x99 hearts.\r\n\r\nHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.\r\n\r\nTattered pages. _The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur\xc3\xa9 of\r\nArs. Pocket Guide to Killarney._\r\n\r\nI might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. _Stephano Dedalo,\r\nalumno optimo, palmam ferenti._\r\n\r\nFather Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet\r\nof Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.\r\n\r\nBinding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of\r\nMoses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read\r\nand read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands.\r\nRecipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love. For me this.\r\nSay the following talisman three times with hands folded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._\r\n\r\nWho wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter\r\nSalanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharms, as mumbling Joachim\xe2\x80\x99s. Down, baldynoddle, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll wool your\r\nwool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you doing here, Stephen?\r\n\r\nDilly\xe2\x80\x99s high shoulders and shabby dress.\r\n\r\nShut the book quick. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you doing? Stephen said.\r\n\r\nA Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It\r\nglowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her\r\nof Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a\r\npinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s token. _Nebrakada femininum._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What have you there? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing\r\nnervously. Is it any good?\r\n\r\nMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.\r\nShadow of my mind.\r\n\r\nHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal\xe2\x80\x99s French primer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?\r\n\r\nShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.\r\n\r\nShow no surprise. Quite natural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, Stephen said. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Mind Maggy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pawn it on you.\r\nI suppose all my books are gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some, Dilly said. We had to.\r\n\r\nShe is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will\r\ndrown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,\r\nmy heart, my soul. Salt green death.\r\n\r\nWe.\r\n\r\nAgenbite of inwit. Inwit\xe2\x80\x99s agenbite.\r\n\r\nMisery! Misery!\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\r\n\r\nThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter\xe2\x80\x99s. Father Cowley\r\nbrushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I\xe2\x80\x99m barricaded up, Simon, with\r\ntwo men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I\xe2\x80\x99m just\r\nwaiting for Ben Dollard. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to say a word to long John to get\r\nhim to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.\r\n\r\nHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\ndoing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!\r\n\r\nHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops\r\ncrossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards\r\nthem at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.\r\n\r\nAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben\r\nDollard\xe2\x80\x99s figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he\r\nmuttered sneeringly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty garment, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, for a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I\r\nthrew out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\r\n\r\nHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes\r\nfrom points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to\r\nGod he\xe2\x80\x99s not paid yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.\r\n\r\nCashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,\r\nglassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, gave forth\r\na deep note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Aw! he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?\r\n\r\nHe turned to both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.\r\n\r\nThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s, rectifiers, attended by\r\nGeraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of\r\nhurdles.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,\r\nhis joyful fingers in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come along with me to the subsheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, he said. I want to show\r\nyou the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He\xe2\x80\x99s a cross between\r\nLobengula and Lynchehaun. He\xe2\x80\x99s well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.\r\nI saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will\r\ncost me a fall if I don\xe2\x80\x99t... Wait awhile... We\xe2\x80\x99re on the right lay,\r\nBob, believe you me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button\r\nof his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the\r\nheavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What few days? he boomed. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t your landlord distrained for rent?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has, Father Cowley said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then our friend\xe2\x80\x99s writ is not worth the paper it\xe2\x80\x99s printed on, Ben\r\nDollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the\r\nparticulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nminister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that\r\nwrit where Jacko put the nuts.\r\n\r\nHe led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his\r\nglasses on his coatfront, following them.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they\r\npassed out of the Castleyard gate.\r\n\r\nThe policeman touched his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\r\n\r\nHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on\r\ntowards Lord Edward street.\r\n\r\nBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s head by Miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s head, appeared\r\nabove the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father\r\nConmee and laid the whole case before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.\r\n\r\nJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them\r\nquickly down Cork hill.\r\n\r\nOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed\r\nAlderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\r\n\r\nThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_\r\noffice. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the\r\nfive shillings too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Without a second word either, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.\r\n\r\nJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.\r\n\r\nThey went down Parliament street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.\r\n\r\nOutside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.\r\n\r\nJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took\r\nthe elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked\r\nuncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s watches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The assistant town clerk\xe2\x80\x99s corns are giving him some trouble, John\r\nWyse Nolan told Mr Power.\r\n\r\nThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s winerooms. The\r\nempty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,\r\nspeaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and\r\ngreeted.\r\n\r\nLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay\r\ndecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he\r\nsaid with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\r\n\r\nHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,\r\nabout their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to\r\nknow, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the\r\nmacebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,\r\nno quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little\r\nLorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him. Damned Irish language,\r\nlanguage of our forefathers.\r\n\r\nLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to\r\nthe assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held\r\nhis peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.\r\n\r\nJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake\r\ntill I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!\r\n\r\nTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning\xe2\x80\x99s flank and\r\npassed in and up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nyou knew him or perhaps you did, though.\r\n\r\nWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long\r\nJohn Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton\xe2\x80\x99s office that was, Martin Cunningham\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nLong John Fanning could not remember him.\r\n\r\nClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the\r\ncool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,\r\nharness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went\r\npast before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the\r\nleaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse\r\nNolan answered from the stairfoot.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his\r\nPanama to Haines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Parnell\xe2\x80\x99s brother. There in the corner.\r\n\r\nThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man\r\nwhose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mulligan said. That\xe2\x80\x99s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.\r\n\r\nJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw\r\nwent up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after,\r\nunder its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and\r\nfell once more upon a working corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a _m\xc3\xa9lange,_ Haines said to the waitress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two _m\xc3\xa9langes,_ Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and\r\nbutter and some cakes as well.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone he said, laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed\r\nDedalus on _Hamlet._\r\n\r\nHaines opened his newbought book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all\r\nminds that have lost their balance.\r\n\r\nThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_England expects_...\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.\r\nWandering \xc3\x86ngus I call him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am sure he has an _id\xc3\xa9e fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin\r\nthoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it\r\nwould be likely to be. Such persons always have.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never\r\ncapture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white\r\ndeath and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.\r\nThe joy of creation...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him\r\nthis morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an\r\ninteresting point out of that.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to\r\nunload her tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid\r\nthe cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,\r\nof retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.\r\nDoes he write anything for your movement?\r\n\r\nHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.\r\nBuck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over\r\nits smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write\r\nsomething in ten years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.\r\nStill, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if he did after all.\r\n\r\nHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be imposed on.\r\n\r\nElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of\r\nships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping\r\nstreet past Benson\xe2\x80\x99s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_\r\nfrom Bridgwater with bricks.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell\xe2\x80\x99s yard. Behind\r\nhim Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with\r\nstickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him\r\na blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.\r\n\r\nCashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr\r\nLewis Werner\xe2\x80\x99s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along\r\nMerrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s house he halted, frowned at Elijah\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nannounced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth\r\nbared he muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Coactus volui._\r\n\r\nHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.\r\n\r\nAs he strode past Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat\r\nbrushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,\r\nhaving buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly\r\nface after the striding form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God\xe2\x80\x99s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You\xe2\x80\x99re blinder\r\nnor I am, you bitch\xe2\x80\x99s bastard!\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposite Ruggy O\xe2\x80\x99Donohoe\xe2\x80\x99s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the\r\npound and a half of Mangan\xe2\x80\x99s, late Fehrenbach\xe2\x80\x99s, porksteaks he had been\r\nsent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming\r\ndull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs\r\nMacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping\r\nsups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nAnd they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole\r\nblooming time and sighing.\r\n\r\nAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,\r\nstopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their\r\npelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning\r\nMasters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s pet lamb, will\r\nmeet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of\r\nfifty sovereigns. Gob, that\xe2\x80\x99d be a good pucking match to see. Myler\r\nKeogh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar\r\nentrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master\r\nDignam on his left turned as he turned. That\xe2\x80\x99s me in mourning. When is\r\nit? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He\r\nturned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap\r\nawry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he\r\nsaw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two\r\npuckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer\r\nsmokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going\r\nfor strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow\r\nwould knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker\r\nfor science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out\r\nof him, dodging and all.\r\n\r\nIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and\r\na swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was\r\ntelling him and grinning all the time.\r\n\r\nNo Sandymount tram.\r\n\r\nMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his\r\nother hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The\r\nblooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming\r\nend to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going tomorrow\r\neither, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he\xe2\x80\x99d get it into the paper tonight.\r\nThen they\xe2\x80\x99ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHis face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a\r\nfly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were\r\nscrewing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were\r\nbringing it downstairs.\r\n\r\nPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling\r\nthe men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and\r\nheavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was\r\nstanding on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to\r\nTunney\xe2\x80\x99s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.\r\nNever see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He\r\ntold me to be a good son to ma. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the other things he\r\nsaid but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor\r\npa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s in purgatory now because\r\nhe went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.\r\n\r\n*    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by\r\nlieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the\r\nviceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs\r\nPaget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by\r\nobsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern\r\nquays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the\r\nmetropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted\r\nhim vainly from afar. Between Queen\xe2\x80\x99s and Whitworth bridges lord\r\nDudley\xe2\x80\x99s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley\r\nWhite, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthe pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose\r\nwith his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough\r\nmore quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot\r\nthrough Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the\r\nporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,\r\nCollis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the\r\ndoorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the\r\nPatriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed\r\nher plan and retracing her steps by King\xe2\x80\x99s windows smiled credulously\r\non the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall\r\nunder Tom Devan\xe2\x80\x99s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of\r\nliquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by\r\nbronze, Miss Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s head by Miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s head watched and admired.\r\nOn Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse\r\nfor the subsheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his\r\nhat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 greeting. From\r\nCahill\xe2\x80\x99s corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made obeisance\r\nunperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held\r\nof yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, taking\r\nleave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger\r\nGreene\xe2\x80\x99s office and Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,\r\ncarrying the Catesby\xe2\x80\x99s cork lino letters for her father who was laid\r\nup, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbig yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its\r\nbeing the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot\xe2\x80\x99s from the shaded door of\r\nKavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness\r\ntowards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The\r\nRight Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed\r\nMicky Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s all times ticking watches and Henry and James\xe2\x80\x99s wax\r\nsmartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_\r\nJames. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the\r\napproach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley\r\nfixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret\r\nwaistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming _soubrette,_ great\r\nMarie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from\r\nher poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon\r\nlieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald\r\nWard A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and\r\nHaines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders\r\nof eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon\r\nJohn Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes\xe2\x80\x99s street Dilly Dedalus,\r\nstraining her sight upward from Chardenal\xe2\x80\x99s first French primer, saw\r\nsunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry\r\nMenton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from\r\nwinebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in\r\nhis fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from\r\nunder the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings.\r\nUnderstanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the\r\nsecond carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably\r\nsurprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby\xe2\x80\x99s corner a jaded white\r\nflagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,\r\nE.L.Y.\xe2\x80\x99S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmusic warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily\r\napparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By\r\nthe provost\xe2\x80\x99s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes\r\nand socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl\xe2\x80\x99s a Yorkshire\r\ngirl._\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 skyblue frontlets and high\r\naction a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a\r\nsuit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute\r\nbut he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and\r\nthe red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His\r\nExcellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of\r\nmusic which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen\r\nhighland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cort\xc3\xa8ge_:\r\n\r\n     But though she\xe2\x80\x99s a factory lass\r\n     And wears no fancy clothes.\r\n     Baraabum.\r\n     Yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve a sort of a\r\n     Yorkshire relish for\r\n     My little Yorkshire rose.\r\n     Baraabum.\r\n\r\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.\r\nShrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F.\r\nStevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding\r\npast Finn\xe2\x80\x99s hotel Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell\r\nstared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr\r\nM. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate.\r\nDeep in Leinster street by Trinity\xe2\x80\x99s postern a loyal king\xe2\x80\x99s man,\r\nHornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by\r\nMerrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes\r\nbeing given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black\r\ncap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up.\r\nThe viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds\r\nfor Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount\r\nstreet. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent\xe2\x80\x99s. In Lower\r\nMount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,\r\npassed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy\xe2\x80\x99s path. At the Royal\r\nCanal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips\r\nagrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road\r\ncorner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in\r\nwhich eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady\r\nmayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne\r\nroads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male\r\nwalkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the\r\nhouse said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the\r\nIrish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the\r\nsalute of Almidano Artifoni\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 11 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nBronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing.\r\n\r\nImperthnthn thnthnthn.\r\n\r\nChips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.\r\n\r\nHorrid!

Where? gold asked more eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the second carriage, miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s wet lips said, laughing in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s looking. Mind till I see.\r\n\r\nShe darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against\r\nthe pane in a halo of hurried breath.\r\n\r\nHer wet lips tittered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s killed looking back.\r\n\r\nShe laughed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O wept! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t men frightful idiots?\r\n\r\nWith sadness.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair\r\nbehind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a\r\nhair. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.\r\n\r\nA man.\r\n\r\nBloowho went by by Moulang\xe2\x80\x99s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of\r\nsin, by Wine\xe2\x80\x99s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by\r\nCarroll\xe2\x80\x99s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.\r\n\r\nThe boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them\r\nunheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s your teas, he said.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned\r\nlithia crate, safe from eyes, low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your _beau,_ is it?\r\n\r\nA haughty bronze replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your\r\nimpertinent insolence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as\r\nshe threatened as he had come.\r\n\r\nBloom.\r\n\r\nOn her flower frowning miss Douce said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t conduct himself\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll wring his ear for him a yard long.\r\n\r\nLadylike in exquisite contrast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.\r\n\r\nShe poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered\r\nunder their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,\r\nwaiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black\r\nsatin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and\r\nseven.\r\n\r\nYes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear,\r\nhoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Am I awfully sunburnt?\r\n\r\nMiss bronze unbloused her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with\r\nthe cherry laurel water?\r\n\r\nMiss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror\r\ngildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their\r\nmidst a shell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And leave it to my hands, she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.\r\n\r\nBidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that\r\nold fogey in Boyd\xe2\x80\x99s for something for my skin.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, don\xe2\x80\x99t remind me of him for mercy\xe2\x80\x99 sake!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.\r\n\r\nSweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears\r\nwith little fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, don\xe2\x80\x99t, she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t listen, she cried.\r\n\r\nBut Bloom?\r\n\r\nMiss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey\xe2\x80\x99s tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For your what? says he.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me think of him or I\xe2\x80\x99ll expire. The hideous old wretch! That\r\nnight in the Antient Concert Rooms.\r\n\r\nShe sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,\r\nruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!\r\n\r\nShrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s throat. Miss Douce\r\nhuffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a\r\nsnout in quest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?\r\n\r\nMiss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And your other eye!\r\n\r\nBloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner\xe2\x80\x99s name. Why do I always think\r\nFigather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lor\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s huguenot name. By\r\nBassi\xe2\x80\x99s blessed virgins Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white\r\nunder, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I\r\ncould not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 son.\r\nHe might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of\r\nfellows in: her white.\r\n\r\nBy went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.\r\n\r\nOf sin.\r\n\r\nIn a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy\r\nyour other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let\r\nfreefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,\r\nhigh piercing notes.\r\n\r\nAh, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and\r\ngigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her\r\nnose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her\r\nfair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,\r\nspluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,\r\ncoughing with choking, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.\r\nWith his bit of beard!\r\n\r\nDouce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,\r\ndelight, joy, indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.\r\n\r\nShrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each\r\neach to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,\r\nshrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I\r\nknows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and\r\npinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!),\r\npanting, sweating (O!), all breathless.\r\n\r\nMarried to Bloom, to greaseabloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I\r\nwished I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t laughed so much. I feel all wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!\r\n\r\nAnd flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.\r\n\r\nBy Cantwell\xe2\x80\x99s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi\xe2\x80\x99s virgins, bright of\r\ntheir oils. Nannetti\xe2\x80\x99s father hawked those things about, wheedling at\r\ndoors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I\r\nwant. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands\r\nturning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I\r\nnet five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet.\r\nThe sweets of sin.\r\n\r\nFlushed less, still less, goldenly paled.\r\n\r\nInto their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his\r\nrocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, welcome back, miss Douce.\r\n\r\nHe held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tiptop.\r\n\r\nHe hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the\r\nstrand all day.\r\n\r\nBronze whiteness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed\r\nher hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce of satin douced her arm away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O go away! she said. You\xe2\x80\x99re very simple, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think.\r\n\r\nHe was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they\r\nchristened me simple Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the\r\ndoctor order today?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble\r\nyou for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.\r\n\r\nJingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.\r\n\r\nWith grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshe turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from\r\nher crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought\r\npouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky\r\nfifenotes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be\r\na great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at\r\nlast, they say. Yes. Yes.\r\n\r\nYes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid\xe2\x80\x99s, into\r\nthe bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.\r\n\r\nNone nought said nothing. Yes.\r\n\r\nGaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was Mr Lidwell in today?\r\n\r\nIn came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex\r\nbridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write.\r\nBuy paper. Daly\xe2\x80\x99s. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on\r\nthe rye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.\r\n\r\nLenehan came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was Mr Boylan looking for me?\r\n\r\nHe asked. She answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?\r\n\r\nShe asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her\r\ngaze upon a page:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No. He was not.\r\n\r\nMiss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the\r\nsandwichbell wound his round body round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Peep! Who\xe2\x80\x99s in the corner?\r\n\r\nNo glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her\r\nstops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.\r\n\r\nJingle jaunty jingle.\r\n\r\nGirlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no\r\nnotice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your\r\nbill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?\r\n\r\nHe droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.\r\n\r\nHe sighed aside:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah me! O my!\r\n\r\nHe greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.\r\n\r\nLenehan opened most genial arms. Who?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.\r\n\r\nDry.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, he said. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise him for the moment. I hear he is\r\nkeeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?\r\n\r\nHe had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In\r\nMooney\xe2\x80\x99s _en ville_ and in Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s _sur mer._ He had received the\r\nrhino for the labour of his muse.\r\n\r\nHe smiled at bronze\xe2\x80\x99s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The _\xc3\xa9lite_ of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh\r\nMacHugh, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel\r\nboy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of\r\nthe O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.\r\n\r\nHe see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nHe looked towards the saloon door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see you have moved the piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking\r\nconcert and I never heard such an exquisite player.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a fact?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,\r\npoor fellow. Not twenty I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\nHe drank and strayed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.\r\n\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s curse on bitch\xe2\x80\x99s bastard.\r\n\r\nTink to her pity cried a diner\xe2\x80\x99s bell. To the door of the bar and\r\ndiningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of\r\nOrmond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.\r\n\r\nWith patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for\r\njinglejaunty blazes boy.\r\n\r\nUpholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the\r\noblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed\r\nindulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the\r\nthicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in\r\naction.\r\n\r\nTwo sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in\r\nWisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s wise Bloom in Daly\xe2\x80\x99s Henry Flower bought. Are you not\r\nhappy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means\r\nsomething, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is.\r\nRespectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom\r\neyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.\r\nSmoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For\r\nsome man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat\r\nriding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.\r\n\r\nJingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.\r\nFollow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And four.\r\n\r\nAt four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go.\r\nTernoon. Think you\xe2\x80\x99re the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.\r\n\r\nFor men.\r\n\r\nIn drowsy silence gold bent on her page.\r\n\r\nFrom the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the\r\ntuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now\r\npoised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly\r\nand softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.\r\n\r\nPat paid for diner\xe2\x80\x99s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and\r\npopcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss\r\nDouce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_The bright stars fade_...\r\n\r\nA voiceless song sang from within, singing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... _the morn is breaking._\r\n\r\nA duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive\r\nhands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,\r\ncalled to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleavetaking, life\xe2\x80\x99s, love\xe2\x80\x99s morn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_The dewdrops pearl_...\r\n\r\nLenehan\xe2\x80\x99s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.\r\n\r\nJingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.\r\n\r\nShe rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,\r\ndreamily rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.\r\n\r\nShe answered, slighting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ask no questions and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear no lies.\r\n\r\nLike lady, ladylike.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he\r\nstrode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and\r\nknew and hailed him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See the conquering hero comes.\r\n\r\nBetween the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered\r\nhero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat\r\nwalked towards Richie Goulding\xe2\x80\x99s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_And I from thee_...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.\r\n\r\nHe touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled\r\non him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer\r\nhair, a bosom and a rose.\r\n\r\nSmart Boylan bespoke potions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a\r\nsloegin for me. Wire in yet?\r\n\r\nNot yet. At four she. Who said four?\r\n\r\nCowley\xe2\x80\x99s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAvoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.\r\nWait.\r\n\r\nHello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,\r\nOrmond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.\r\nSee, not be seen. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom\r\nfollowed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her\r\nbust, that all but burst, so high.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!\r\n\r\nBut easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.\r\n\r\nShebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his\r\nlips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and\r\nsyrupped with her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine goods in small parcels.\r\n\r\nThat is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, Blazes said.\r\n\r\nHe pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you\r\nknow. Fancy of a friend of mine.\r\n\r\nLenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.\r\nIdolores. The eastern seas.\r\n\r\nClock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),\r\nbearing away teatray. Clock clacked.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce took Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It\r\nclanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till\r\nand hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nLenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged\r\nBlazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s elbowsleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear the time, he said.\r\n\r\nThe bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered\r\ntables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table\r\nnear the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not\r\ncome: whet appetite. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.\r\n\r\nSparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure\xe2\x80\x99s skyblue bow and eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on, pressed Lenehan. There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one. He never heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... _to Flora\xe2\x80\x99s lips did hie._\r\n\r\nHigh, a high note pealed in the treble clear.\r\n\r\nBronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes\r\nBoylan\xe2\x80\x99s flower and eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Please, please.\r\n\r\nHe pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_I could not leave thee_...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, now, urged Lenehan. _Sonnez la cloche!_ O do! There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one.\r\n\r\nShe looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling\r\nfaces watched her bend.\r\n\r\nQuavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,\r\nand lost and found it, faltering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_\r\n\r\nBending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted\r\nthem still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Sonnez!_\r\n\r\nSmack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter\r\nsmackwarm against her smackable a woman\xe2\x80\x99s warmhosed thigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nShe smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren\xe2\x80\x99t men?), but, lightward\r\ngliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.\r\n\r\nBoylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his\r\nchalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound\r\neyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by\r\nmirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses\r\nshimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with\r\nsunnier bronze.\r\n\r\nYes, bronze from anearby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... _Sweetheart, goodbye!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m off, said Boylan with impatience.\r\n\r\nHe slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.\r\nTom Rochford...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.\r\n\r\nLenehan gulped to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming.\r\n\r\nHe followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the\r\nthreshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you do, Mr Dollard?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s vague bass answered, turning an\r\ninstant from Father Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s woe. He won\xe2\x80\x99t give you any trouble, Bob.\r\nAlf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We\xe2\x80\x99ll put a barleystraw in\r\nthat Judas Iscariot\xe2\x80\x99s ear this time.\r\n\r\nSighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an\r\neyelid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a\r\nditty. We heard the piano.\r\n\r\nBald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.\r\nAnd Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now.\r\nHow warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat.\r\nLet me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.\r\n\r\nHe ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:\r\nhold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His\r\ngouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.\r\n\r\nBald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted\r\nPower and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.\r\n\r\nJingle a tinkle jaunted.\r\n\r\nBloom heard a jing, a little sound. He\xe2\x80\x99s off. Light sob of breath Bloom\r\nsighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Jingle.\r\nHear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,\r\nsmitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting\r\nlight), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down\r\npensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar\r\nwhere bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast\r\ninexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of\r\nshadow, _eau de Nil._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded\r\nthem. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the\r\nCollard grand.\r\n\r\nThere was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop him.\r\nHe was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the\r\npunished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.\r\n\r\nThey laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding\r\ngarment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy pipe, by the way?\r\n\r\nHe wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried\r\ntwo diners\xe2\x80\x99 drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I saved the situation, Ben, I think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too.\r\nThat was a brilliant idea, Bob.\r\n\r\nFather Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the\r\nsitua. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in\r\nthe coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and\r\nwho was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you\r\nremember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap\r\nin Keogh\xe2\x80\x99s gave us the number. Remember?\r\n\r\nBen remembered, his broad visage wondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any money either. What? Any God\xe2\x80\x99s quantity of cocked hats\r\nand boleros and trunkhose. What?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of\r\nall descriptions.\r\n\r\nJingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.\r\n\r\nLiver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.\r\n\r\nMrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice\r\nname he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tweedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Is she alive?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And kicking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She was a daughter of...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Daughter of the regiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Irish? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, faith. Is she, Simon?\r\n\r\nPuff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish\r\nMolly, O.\r\n\r\nHe puffed a pungent plumy blast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.\r\n\r\nThey pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by\r\nmaraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,\r\nDrumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.\r\n\r\nPat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before\r\nhe ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods\xe2\x80\x99 roes\r\nwhile Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then\r\nkidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.\r\n\r\nBloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.\r\n\r\nBy Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in\r\nheat, mare\xe2\x80\x99s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:\r\nsprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you\r\nthe? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.\r\n\r\nOver their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding\r\nchords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...\r\n\r\nRoll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94War! War! cried Father Cowley. You\xe2\x80\x99re the warrior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nHe stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sure, you\xe2\x80\x99d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said\r\nthrough smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.\r\n\r\nIn bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben.\r\n_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She\r\npassed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful\r\nweather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant\r\nwas going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\r\nBut it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She\r\nwaved about her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord\r\nlieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much\r\ntrouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that.\r\nLord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x94............ _my ardent soul\r\nI care not foror the morrow._\r\n\r\nIn liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is.\r\nBen Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit\r\nfor that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers.\r\nMolly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed,\r\nscreaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so\r\nmany! Well, of course that\xe2\x80\x99s what gives him the base barreltone. For\r\ninstance eunuchs. Wonder who\xe2\x80\x99s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley.\r\nMusical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap.\r\nStopped.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George\r\nLidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the\r\nold dingdong again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.\r\n\r\nBloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the\r\nBurton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,\r\nflowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do.\r\nBest value in Dub.\r\n\r\nPiano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,\r\nmutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the\r\nbowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore.\r\nNight we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus,\r\nbetween the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.\r\nConductor\xe2\x80\x99s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.\r\n\r\nOnly the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a\r\nlovely. Gravy\xe2\x80\x99s rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that\r\nonce or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their\r\nharps. I. He. Old. Young.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.\r\n\r\nStrongly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_M\xe2\x80\x99appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.\r\n\r\nDown stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long\r\narms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly\r\nhe sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a\r\nship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave\r\nupon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.\r\n\r\nCowley sang:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x99appari tutt\xe2\x80\x99amor:\r\nIl mio sguardo l\xe2\x80\x99incontr..._\r\n\r\nShe waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to\r\nwind, love, speeding sail, return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,\r\ntouched the obedient keys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.\r\n\r\nThe keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.\r\n\r\nUp stage strode Father Cowley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, Simon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll accompany you, he said. Get up.\r\n\r\nBy Graham Lemon\xe2\x80\x99s pineapple rock, by Elvery\xe2\x80\x99s elephant jingly jogged.\r\n\r\nSteak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom\r\nand Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.\r\n\r\nMost beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He\r\nheard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M\xe2\x80\x99Guckin! Yes. In his way.\r\nChoirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.\r\nNever forget it. Never.\r\n\r\nTenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.\r\nBackache he. Bright\xe2\x80\x99s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying\r\nthe piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off\r\nawhile. Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate. Kidney pie.\r\nSweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in.\r\nCharacteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the\r\nglass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then\r\nsquander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he\xe2\x80\x99s wanted not a\r\nfarthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.\r\n\r\nNever would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In\r\nthe gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.\r\n\r\nSpeech paused on Richie\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\nComing out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all. Believes his\r\nown lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_All is lost now_.\r\n\r\nRichie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee\r\nmurmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two\r\nnotes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my\r\nmotives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in\r\nall. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now.\r\nMournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.\r\n\r\nBloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.\r\nOrder. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence\r\nin the moon. Brave. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know their danger. Still hold her back. Call\r\nname. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.\r\n\r\nNever in all his life had Richie Goulding.\r\n\r\nHe knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise\r\nchild that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?\r\n\r\nBloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking\r\nRichie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his\r\neye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I\r\ndid sir. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.\r\n\r\nPiano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably.\r\nStopped again.\r\n\r\nDollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With it, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind\r\nsolicitations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall\r\nendeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.\r\n\r\nBy the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina\r\nto tankards two her pinnacles of gold.\r\n\r\nThe harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant,\r\ndrew a voice away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_When first I saw that form endearing_...\r\n\r\nRichie turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Si Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 voice, he said.\r\n\r\nBraintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow\r\nendearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to\r\nPat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the\r\nbar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited,\r\nwaiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._\r\n\r\nThrough the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves\r\nin murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem\r\ndulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their\r\neach his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each\r\nseemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw,\r\nlost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\nit in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.\r\n\r\nLove that is singing: love\xe2\x80\x99s old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the\r\nelastic band of his packet. Love\xe2\x80\x99s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold. Bloom\r\nwound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound\r\nit round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Full of hope and all delighted_...\r\n\r\nTenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his\r\nfeet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.\r\nWhat perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last\r\nlook at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How\r\ndo you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,\r\nin her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.\r\n\r\nAlas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_But alas, \xe2\x80\x99twas idle dreaming_...\r\n\r\nGlorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly\r\nman! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his\r\nwife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing\r\ntoo. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind\r\nsoup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.\r\n\r\nTenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nchat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.\r\n\r\nWords? Music? No: it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s behind.\r\n\r\nBloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.\r\n\r\nBloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music\r\nout, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her\r\ntapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy\r\nthe feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o\xe2\x80\x99er sluices pouring gushes. Flood,\r\ngush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... _ray of hope is_...\r\n\r\nBeaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse\r\nunsqueaked a ray of hopk.\r\n\r\n_Martha_ it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel\xe2\x80\x99s song. Lovely\r\nname you have. Can\xe2\x80\x99t write. Accept my little pres. Play on her\r\nheartstrings pursestrings too. She\xe2\x80\x99s a. I called you naughty boy. Still\r\nthe name: Martha. How strange! Today.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to\r\nRichie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to\r\nwait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,\r\nhow look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\nWish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in\r\nDrago\xe2\x80\x99s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still\r\nhear it better here than in the bar though farther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Each graceful look_...\r\n\r\nFirst night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s in Terenure. Yellow,\r\nblack lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.\r\nFate. Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down\r\nshe sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Charmed my eye_...\r\n\r\nSinging. _Waiting_ she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume\r\nof what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat\r\nwarbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy\r\neyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in\r\nshadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Martha! Ah, Martha!_\r\n\r\nQuitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant\r\nto love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In\r\ncry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For\r\nonly her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where.\r\nSomewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Co-ome, thou lost one!\r\n\r\nCo-ome, thou dear one!_\r\n\r\nAlone. One love. One hope. One comfort me.

Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap,\r\nsaid, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell,\r\nPat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent\r\nwith tank and bronze Miss Douce and gold Miss Mina.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.\r\nJingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson,\r\nreverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now.\r\nAtrot, in heat, heatseated. _Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la._\r\nSlower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too\r\nslow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.\r\n\r\nAn afterclang of Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s chords closed, died on the air made richer.\r\n\r\nAnd Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,\r\nLidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two\r\nmore tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,\r\ncoral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsing, Simon, like a garden thrush.\r\n\r\nLionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy\r\nserved. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired,\r\nadmired. But Bloom sang dumb.\r\n\r\nAdmiring.\r\n\r\nRichie, admiring, descanted on that man\xe2\x80\x99s glorious voice. He remembered\r\none night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang _\xe2\x80\x99Twas rank and\r\nfame_: in Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99twas. Good God he never heard in all his life\r\na note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so\r\nclear so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice\r\nlives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.\r\n\r\nGoulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the\r\nnight, Si in Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s, Dedalus house, sang _\xe2\x80\x99Twas rank and fame._\r\n\r\nHe, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom,\r\nof the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing _\xe2\x80\x99Twas rank and\r\nfame_ in his, Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s, house.\r\n\r\nBrothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the\r\nlute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more.\r\nThe night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,\r\nmore than all others.\r\n\r\nThat voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the silence after you\r\nfeel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.\r\n\r\nBloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the\r\nslender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While\r\nGoulding talked of Barraclough\xe2\x80\x99s voice production, while Tom Kernan,\r\nharking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening\r\nFather Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While\r\nbig Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he\r\nsmoked, who smoked.\r\n\r\nThou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his\r\nstring. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them\r\non. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head.\r\nOuttohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat\xe2\x80\x99s tail wriggling!\r\nFive bob I gave. _Corpus paradisum._ Corncrake croaker: belly like a\r\npoisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too.

It snapped.\r\n\r\nJingle into Dorset street.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.\r\n\r\nFirst gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And\r\nsecond tankard told her so. That that was so.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not\r\nbelieve: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first:\r\ngent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell:\r\nthe tank.\r\n\r\nBetter write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.\r\n\r\nBald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A\r\npad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is.\r\nFew lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is\r\nthis wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,\r\nenvelope: unconcerned. It\xe2\x80\x99s so characteristic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is, Bloom said.\r\n\r\nNumbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two\r\ndivided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus\r\ntwo plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling.\r\nAlways find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics.\r\nAnd you think you\xe2\x80\x99re listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it\r\nlike: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall\r\nquite flat. It\xe2\x80\x99s on account of the sounds it is.\r\n\r\nInstance he\xe2\x80\x99s playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till\r\nyou hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then\r\nhear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over\r\nbarrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune.\r\nQuestion of mood you\xe2\x80\x99re in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up\r\nand down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to\r\ninvent dummy pianos for that. _Blumenlied_ I bought for her. The name.\r\nPlaying it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the\r\nstables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nBald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite\r\nflat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.\r\n\r\nIt was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy\r\nin Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles.\r\nQueenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in\r\nthe moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God,\r\nsuch music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.\r\n\r\nSour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a\r\nmoonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.\r\n\r\nDown the edge of his _Freeman_ baton ranged Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s, your other eye,\r\nscanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick.\r\nHeigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...\r\n\r\nHope he\xe2\x80\x99s not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his _Freeman._\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear\r\nsir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I\r\nput?

While you wait if you wait he will wait while you\r\nwait. Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.\r\n\r\nDouce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.\r\n\r\nShe had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell\r\nshe brought.\r\n\r\nTo the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding\r\nseahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Listen! she bade him.\r\n\r\nUnder Tom Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow.\r\nAuthentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband\r\ntook him by the throat. _Scoundrel,_ said he, _You\xe2\x80\x99ll sing no more\r\nlovesongs._ He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom.\r\nCowley lay back.\r\n\r\nAh, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard. Wonderful.\r\nShe held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in\r\ncontrast glided. To hear.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more\r\nfaintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for\r\nother, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.\r\n\r\nBronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.\r\n\r\nHer ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside.\r\nLovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream\r\nfirst make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\r\nFever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell\r\nwith seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks\r\nthe mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A\r\ncave. No admittance except on business.\r\n\r\nThe sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse\r\nin the ear sometimes. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sea. Corpuscle islands.\r\n\r\nWonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur,\r\nhearing: then laid it by, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.\r\n\r\nCharming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBy Larry O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s, by Larry, bold Larry O\xe2\x80\x99, Boylan swayed and Boylan\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nFrom the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting.

She nobly\r\nanswered: with a gentleman friend.\r\n\r\nBob Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord\r\nhas the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a\r\nlight bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling,\r\nand for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one,\r\none: two, one, three, four.\r\n\r\nSea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket,\r\ncocks, hens don\xe2\x80\x99t crow, snakes hissss. There\xe2\x80\x99s music everywhere.\r\nRuttledge\xe2\x80\x99s door: ee creaking. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s noise. Minuet of _Don\r\nGiovanni_ he\xe2\x80\x99s playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle\r\nchambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating\r\ndockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look\r\nat us.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other\r\njoy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows\r\nyou are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt.\r\nThen know.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk.\r\nTongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can\xe2\x80\x99t manage\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I\xe2\x80\x99m warm, dark,\r\nopen. Molly in _quis est homo_: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to\r\nhear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.\r\n\r\nJog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue\r\nclocks came light to earth.\r\n\r\nO, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It\r\nis a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is.\r\nTinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the\r\nresonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the\r\nlaw of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt\xe2\x80\x99s, Hungarian,\r\ngipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle.\r\nHissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.\r\n\r\nOne rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de\r\nKock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock.\r\nCockcock.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Qui sdegno,_ Ben, said Father Cowley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. _The Croppy Boy._ Our native Doric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do, do, they begged in one.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To\r\nme. How much?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What key? Six sharps?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.\r\n\r\nBob Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.\r\n\r\nMust go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must.\r\nGot money somewhere. He\xe2\x80\x99s on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He\r\nseehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him\r\ntwopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family\r\nwaiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nBut wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the\r\ndark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.\r\n\r\nThe voice of dark age, of unlove, earth\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue made grave approach\r\nand painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men\r\nand true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it.\r\nCroak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big\r\nships\xe2\x80\x99 chandler\xe2\x80\x99s business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh\r\nhome. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.\r\n\r\nThe priest\xe2\x80\x99s at home. A false priest\xe2\x80\x99s servant bade him welcome. Step\r\nin. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.\r\n\r\nRuin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their\r\ndays in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.\r\n\r\nThe voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a\r\nlonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them\r\nthe gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.\r\n\r\nDecent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll win in _Answers_, poets\xe2\x80\x99\r\npicture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting\r\nhatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See\r\nblank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner.\r\nGood voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.\r\n\r\nListen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf\r\nPat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened.\r\n\r\nThe chords harped slower.\r\n\r\nThe voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.\r\nBen\xe2\x80\x99s contrite beard confessed. _in nomine Domini,_ in God\xe2\x80\x99s name he\r\nknelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: _mea culpa._\r\n\r\nLatin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion\r\ncorpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey,\r\n_corpusnomine._ Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nThey listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well\r\nexpressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.\r\n\r\nThe sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed\r\nthree times. You bitch\xe2\x80\x99s bast. And once at masstime he had gone to\r\nplay. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother\xe2\x80\x99s rest he\r\nhad not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.\r\n\r\nBronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhalf know I\xe2\x80\x99m. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.\r\n\r\nBronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face?\r\nThey always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.\r\n\r\nCockcarracarra.\r\n\r\nWhat do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes.\r\nNight Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked\r\nthat best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain\r\ntoo. Custom his country perhaps. That\xe2\x80\x99s music too. Not as bad as it\r\nsounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses\r\nhelpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open\r\ncrocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nShe looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show.\r\nClove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question.\r\nTold her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa\xe2\x80\x99s. Hypnotised,\r\nlistening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down\r\ninto her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you\r\nmust hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the\r\ntune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!\r\n\r\nAll gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his\r\nbrothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last\r\nof his name and race.\r\n\r\nI too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No\r\nson. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?\r\n\r\nHe bore no hate.\r\n\r\nHate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old.\r\n\r\nBig Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush\r\nstruggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?\r\n\r\nIreland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to\r\nspeak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Bless me, father,_ Dollard the croppy cried. _Bless me and let me\r\ngo._\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week.\r\nFellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those\r\ngirls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl\xe2\x80\x99s romance.\r\nLetters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy\xe2\x80\x99s owny\r\nMumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nLow sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest\r\nrustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all\r\nby heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap.\r\n\r\nThrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.\r\n\r\nBlank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it:\r\npage. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young.\r\nEven admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white\r\nwoman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women.\r\nGoddess I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see. They want it. Not too much polite. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\r\ngets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make\r\nher hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that\r\nhurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so\r\nlike the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nVentriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?\r\n\r\nWill? You? I. Want. You. To.\r\n\r\nWith hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour\xe2\x80\x99s your time to live,\r\nyour last.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap.\r\n\r\nThrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want\r\nto, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs\r\nPurefoy. Hope she\xe2\x80\x99s over. Because their wombs.\r\n\r\nA liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes,\r\ncalmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On\r\nyonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom\xe2\x80\x99s wave (her heaving\r\nembon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath:\r\nbreath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of\r\nmaidenhair.\r\n\r\nBut look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha.\r\nLidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from\r\nhere though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.\r\n\r\nOn the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave\r\nit to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the\r\npolished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and\r\nfinger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid\r\nso smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding\r\nthrough their sliding ring.\r\n\r\nWith a cock with a carra.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nI hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.\r\n\r\nThe chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be.\r\n\r\nGet out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my hat. Pass\r\nby her. Can leave that _Freeman_. Letter I have. Suppose she were the?\r\nNo. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice\r\nTisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.\r\n\r\nWell, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O\xe2\x80\x99er ryehigh blue.\r\nOw. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have\r\nsweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card\r\ninside. Yes.\r\n\r\nBy deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.\r\n\r\nAt Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid.\r\nDolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to\r\ndolorous prayer.\r\n\r\nBy rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,\r\nby popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze\r\nand faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so\r\nlonely Bloom.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nPray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace.\r\nBreathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nScaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway\r\nheard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all\r\ntreading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill\r\nto wash it down. Glad I avoided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you\xe2\x80\x99re as good as ever you\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad,\r\nupon my soul and honour it is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lablache, said Father Cowley.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and\r\nall big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering\r\ncastagnettes in the air.\r\n\r\nBig Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.\r\n\r\nRrr.\r\n\r\nAnd deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all\r\nlaughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce composed her rose to wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben\xe2\x80\x99s fat back shoulderblade.\r\nFit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nRrrrrrrsss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.\r\n\r\nRichie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly\r\nhe waited. Unpaid Pat too.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nMiss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dollard, they murmured low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dollard, murmured tankard.\r\n\r\nTank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the\r\ntank.\r\n\r\nHe murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that\r\nis to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it?\r\nDollard, yes.\r\n\r\nYes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely,\r\nmurmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And _The last rose of summer_ was a lovely\r\nsong. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nGassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street.\r\nWish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your\r\nnerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth.\r\nThat rules the world.\r\n\r\nFar. Far. Far. Far.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nUp the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady,\r\nwith sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went\r\nPoldy on.\r\n\r\nTap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.\r\n\r\nCowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way\r\nonly half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All\r\nears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time.\r\nDotty. You daren\xe2\x80\x99t budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking\r\nshop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.\r\n\r\nAll a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you\r\nnever know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year.\r\nQueer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys.\r\nSeated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself\r\nor the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek\r\ncursing (want to have wadding or something in his no don\xe2\x80\x99t she cried),\r\nthen all of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.\r\n\r\nPwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s little wee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him\r\nthis morning at poor little Paddy Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By the bye there\xe2\x80\x99s a tuningfork in there on the...\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw,\r\nforgot it when he was here.\r\n\r\nBlind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so\r\nexquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99lldo! cried Father Cowley.\r\n\r\nRrrrrr.\r\n\r\nI feel I want...\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.\r\n\r\nUnder the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely,\r\nlast sardine of summer. Bloom alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nBloom went by Barry\xe2\x80\x99s. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had.\r\nTwentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love\r\none another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of\r\nattorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.\r\n\r\nBut for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation:\r\nMickey Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home\r\nafter pig\xe2\x80\x99s cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing\r\nhis band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses\xe2\x80\x99 skins. Welt\r\nthem through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be\r\nwhat you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by\r\nDaly\xe2\x80\x99s window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see)\r\nblew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn\xe2\x80\x99t), mermaid, coolest whiff of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nInstruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb\r\nand tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in\r\nLombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its\r\nown, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? _Cloche.\r\nSonnez la._ Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle.\r\nLocks and keys! Sweep! Four o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x99s well! Sleep! All is lost\r\nnow. Drum? Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier, bumbailiff.

As we march, we march along, march\r\nalong. Pom.\r\n\r\nI must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet. Just a question of\r\ncustom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same he\r\nmust have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap.\r\nMuffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin.\r\nO, the whore of the lane!\r\n\r\nA frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the\r\nday along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form\r\nendearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn.\r\nWho had the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she.\r\nPsst! Any chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady\r\ndoes be with you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that.\r\nAppointment we made knowing we\xe2\x80\x99d never, well hardly ever. Too dear too\r\nnear to home sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day.\r\nFace like dip. Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look\r\nin here.\r\n\r\nIn Lionel Marks\xe2\x80\x99s antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold\r\ndear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered\r\ncandlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might\r\nlearn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want it. That\xe2\x80\x99s what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants\r\nto sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to\r\ncharge me for the edge he gave it. She\xe2\x80\x99s passing now. Six bob.\r\n\r\nMust be the cider or perhaps the burgund.\r\n\r\nNear bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking\r\nglasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia\xe2\x80\x99s tempting\r\nlast rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a\r\nfifth: Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.\r\n\r\nTap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.\r\n\r\nBloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks\xe2\x80\x99s window. Robert\r\nEmmet\xe2\x80\x99s last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94True men like you men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, Ben.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will lift your glass with us.\r\n\r\nThey lifted.\r\n\r\nTschink. Tschunk.\r\n\r\nTip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He saw\r\nnot gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor\r\nRichie nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee.

I turned around to let him have\r\nthe weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony\r\nBatter only Joe Hynes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody\r\nchimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Soot\xe2\x80\x99s luck, says Joe. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the old ballocks you were talking to?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I\xe2\x80\x99m on two minds not to give that\r\nfellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and\r\nladders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Devil a much, says I. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the\r\ngarrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\xe2\x80\x94old Troy was just giving\r\nme a wrinkle about him\xe2\x80\x94lifted any God\xe2\x80\x99s quantity of tea and sugar to\r\npay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a\r\nhop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Circumcised? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a\r\npenny out of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That the lay you\xe2\x80\x99re on now? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful\r\ndebts. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the most notorious bloody robber you\xe2\x80\x99d meet in a\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of\r\nrain. _Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him\r\nto send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I\xe2\x80\x99ll have him\r\nsummonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a\r\nlicence._ And he after stuffing himself till he\xe2\x80\x99s fit to burst. Jesus,\r\nI had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. _He drink me\r\nmy teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?_\r\n\r\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter\r\ncalled the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty,\r\nesquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward,\r\ngentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds\r\navoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per\r\npound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed\r\ncrystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor\r\nto the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling\r\nfor value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said\r\nvendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three\r\nshillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall\r\nnot be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said\r\npurchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and\r\nexclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good\r\nwill and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by\r\nthe said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as\r\nthis day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors,\r\ntrustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs,\r\nsuccessors, trustees and assigns of the other part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says I. Sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s out in John of God\xe2\x80\x99s off his head, poor man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come around to Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barney mavourneen\xe2\x80\x99s be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What was that, Joe? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to\r\ngive the citizen the hard word about it.\r\n\r\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the\r\ncourthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he\r\nhas it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get over\r\nthat bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a\r\nlicence, says he.\r\n\r\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There\r\nrises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as\r\nin life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant\r\nland it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport\r\nthe gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,\r\nthe grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed\r\ncoarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too\r\nnumerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the\r\neast the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass\r\nfoliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted\r\nplanetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal\r\nworld with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely\r\nmaidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing\r\nthe most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects\r\nas for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts\r\nof eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful\r\ninsects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to\r\nSlievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht\r\nthe just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan\xe2\x80\x99s land and of\r\nArmagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the\r\nsons of kings.\r\n\r\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen\r\nby mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for\r\nthat purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits\r\nof that land for O\xe2\x80\x99Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain\r\ndescended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring\r\nfoison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,\r\npineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,\r\ndrills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,\r\nYork and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets\r\nof mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and\r\nred green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples\r\nand chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and\r\npelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their\r\ncanes.\r\n\r\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you\r\nnotorious bloody hill and dale robber!\r\n\r\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed\r\newes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers\r\nand roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and\r\nCuffe\xe2\x80\x99s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the\r\nvarious different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus\r\nheifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime\r\npremiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,\r\ncackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,\r\nchamping, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from\r\npasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy\r\nvales of Thomond, from the M\xe2\x80\x99Gillicuddy\xe2\x80\x99s reeks the inaccessible and\r\nlordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the\r\nplace of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance\r\nof milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer\xe2\x80\x99s firkins\r\nand targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great\r\nhundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\r\n\r\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s and there, sure enough, was the\r\ncitizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that\r\nbloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would\r\ndrop in the way of drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his\r\nload of papers, working for the cause.\r\n\r\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.\r\nBe a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that\r\nbloody dog. I\xe2\x80\x99m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off\r\na constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper\r\nabout a licence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stand and deliver, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pass, friends, says he.\r\n\r\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s your opinion of the times?\r\n\r\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his\r\nfork.\r\n\r\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Foreign wars is the cause of it.\r\n\r\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s the Russians wish to tyrannise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a thirst on me\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell for half a crown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wine of the country, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s yours? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how\xe2\x80\x99s the old heart, citizen? says\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never better, _a chara_, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\r\n\r\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck\r\nand, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\r\n\r\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was\r\nthat of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired\r\nfreelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded\r\ndeepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed\r\nhero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his\r\nrocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of\r\nhis body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair\r\nin hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).\r\nThe widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue\r\nprojected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous\r\nobscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in\r\nwhich a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the\r\ndimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm\r\nbreath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his\r\nmouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations\r\nof his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the\r\nsummit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to\r\nvibrate and tremble.\r\n\r\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to\r\nthe knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a\r\ngirdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of\r\ndeerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were\r\nencased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet\r\nbeing shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of\r\nthe same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled\r\nat every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with\r\nrude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and\r\nheroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine\r\nhostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O\xe2\x80\x99Growney, Michael\r\nDwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M\xe2\x80\x99Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley,\r\nThomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain\r\nMoonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.\r\nFursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone,\r\nthe Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of\r\nCastile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte\r\nCarlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn\xe2\x80\x99t, Benjamin Franklin,\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish,\r\nJulius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell,\r\nMichelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the\r\nHermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian\r\nConfucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan\r\nand Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold\r\nSoldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen\r\nBawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben\r\nHowth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss\r\nCroker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva,\r\nThe Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky\r\nNagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O\xe2\x80\x99Donovan Rossa, Don\r\nPhilip O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested\r\nby him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe\r\nwhose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a\r\nsupposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which\r\nhis master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a\r\nmighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\r\n\r\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the\r\nsight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And there\xe2\x80\x99s more where that came from, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sweat of my brow, says Joe. \xe2\x80\x99Twas the prudent member gave me the\r\nwheeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and\r\nGreek street with his cod\xe2\x80\x99s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\r\n\r\nWho comes through Michan\xe2\x80\x99s land, bedight in sable armour? O\xe2\x80\x99Bloom, the\r\nson of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory\xe2\x80\x99s son: he of the\r\nprudent soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For the old woman of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s street, says the citizen, the subsidised\r\norgan. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at\r\nthis blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. _The Irish\r\nIndependent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend. Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland\r\nIndependent,_ and I\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you and the marriages.\r\n\r\nAnd he starts reading them out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\non Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How\xe2\x80\x99s that, eh? Wright\r\nand Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the\r\nlate George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and\r\nRidsdale at Saint Jude\xe2\x80\x99s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,\r\ndean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London:\r\nCarr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the\r\nMoat house, Chepstow...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,\r\nTottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,\r\nLiverpool, Isabella Helen. How\xe2\x80\x99s that for a national press, eh, my\r\nbrown son! How\xe2\x80\x99s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had\r\nthe start of us. Drink that, citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, says he, honourable person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\r\n\r\nAh! Ow! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.\r\nDeclare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\r\n\r\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came\r\nswiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him\r\nthere passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred\r\nscrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,\r\nfairest of her race.\r\n\r\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsnug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in\r\nthe corner that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob\r\nDoran. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the\r\ndoor. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen\r\nin his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter\r\nand the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting\r\nlike a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at him, says he. Breen. He\xe2\x80\x99s traipsing all round Dublin with a\r\npostcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\r\n\r\nAnd he doubled up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take a what? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O hell! says I.\r\n\r\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that\xe2\x80\x99d put the fear of God in you\r\nseeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Bi i dho husht,_ says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton\xe2\x80\x99s and then he went round\r\nto Collis and Ward\xe2\x80\x99s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round\r\nto the subsheriff\xe2\x80\x99s for a lark. O God, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a pain laughing. U. p: up.\r\nThe long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody\r\nold lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a\r\npony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen\r\nlong John\xe2\x80\x99s eye. U. p ....\r\n\r\nAnd he started laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\r\n\r\nTerence O\xe2\x80\x99Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full\r\nof the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and\r\nBungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of\r\ndeathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and\r\nmass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour\r\njuices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day\r\nfrom their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\r\n\r\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,\r\nthat nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that\r\nthirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\r\n\r\nBut he, the young chief of the O\xe2\x80\x99Bergan\xe2\x80\x99s, could ill brook to be\r\noutdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a\r\ntestoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork\r\nwas seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of\r\nBrunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of\r\nGod of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the\r\nBritish dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress\r\nof India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the\r\nwellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to\r\nthe going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and\r\ndown outside?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen\xe2\x80\x99s letters. Look at here.\r\n\r\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you codding? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\r\n\r\nSo Joe took up the letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\r\n\r\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust. Bob\xe2\x80\x99s a queer chap when\r\nthe porter\xe2\x80\x99s up in him so says I just to make talk:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x99s Willy Murray those times, Alf?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy\r\nDignam. Only I was running after that...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With Dignam, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it Paddy? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Alf. Why?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know he\xe2\x80\x99s dead? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sure I\xe2\x80\x99m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as\r\na pikestaff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s dead? says Bob Doran.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray\r\nwith him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim\xe2\x80\x99s... What? Dignam\r\ndead?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who\xe2\x80\x99s talking about...?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dead! says Alf. He\xe2\x80\x99s no more dead than you are.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Paddy? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good Christ! says Alf.\r\n\r\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by\r\ntantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing\r\nluminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of\r\nthe etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge\r\nof jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was\r\neffected through the pituitary body and also by means of the\r\norangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar\r\nplexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the\r\nheavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr\xc4\x81l\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 or return\r\nbut was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty\r\nentities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his\r\nfirst sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously\r\nhe had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had\r\nsummit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.\r\nInterrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the\r\nflesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the\r\nspirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort\r\nsuch as t\xc4\x81l\xc4\x81f\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81, \xc4\x81l\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81r, h\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81ld\xc4\x81, w\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81kl\xc4\x81s\xc4\x81t and that the highest\r\nadepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.\r\nHaving requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently\r\nafforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted\r\nall who were still at the wrong side of M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 to acknowledge the true\r\npath for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were\r\nout for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was\r\nthen queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the\r\ndefunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are\r\nstill in the body. Mind C. K. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pile it on._ It was ascertained\r\nthat the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.\r\nJ. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the\r\ndefunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment\r\narrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to\r\nhis dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for\r\nwas at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair\r\nshould be sent to Cullen\xe2\x80\x99s to be soled only as the heels were still\r\ngood. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in\r\nthe other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was\r\nintimated that this had given satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O\xe2\x80\x99Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was\r\nhis foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with\r\nyour wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom, says he. He\xe2\x80\x99s on point duty up and down there for the last ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\r\n\r\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\r\n\r\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest\r\nblackguard in Dublin when he\xe2\x80\x99s under the influence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who said Christ is good?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy\r\nDignam?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He\xe2\x80\x99s over all his troubles.\r\n\r\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\r\n\r\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob\r\nDoran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you\xe2\x80\x99re there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\r\n\r\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat.\r\nFitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,\r\nMooney, the bumbailiff\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke\r\nstreet, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told\r\nme that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on\r\nher, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The noblest, the truest, says he. And he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, poor little Willy,\r\npoor little Paddy Dignam.\r\n\r\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that\r\nbeam of heaven.\r\n\r\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come in, come on, he won\xe2\x80\x99t eat you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod\xe2\x80\x99s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was\r\nMartin Cunningham there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Christ M\xe2\x80\x99Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to\r\nthis, will you?\r\n\r\nAnd he starts reading out one.\r\n\r\n_7 Hunter Street,\r\nLiverpool._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the High Sheriff of Dublin,\r\n            Dublin._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful\r\ncase i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i\r\nhanged..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show us, Joe, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in\r\nPentonville prison and i was assistant when..._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jesus, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._\r\n\r\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once\r\nin he can\xe2\x80\x99t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my\r\nterms is five ginnees._\r\n\r\n_H. Rumbold,\r\n            Master Barber._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them\r\nto hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you\r\nhave?\r\n\r\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t and\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said\r\nwell he\xe2\x80\x99d just take a cigar. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99s a prudent member and no mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with\r\na black border round it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang\r\ntheir own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\r\n\r\nAnd he was telling us there\xe2\x80\x99s two fellows waiting below to pull his\r\nheels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they\r\nchop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\r\n\r\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their\r\ndeadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever\r\nwight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so\r\nsaith the Lord.\r\n\r\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom\r\ncomes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the\r\nbusiness and the old dog smelling him all the time I\xe2\x80\x99m told those\r\njewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The poor bugger\xe2\x80\x99s tool that\xe2\x80\x99s being hanged, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That so? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God\xe2\x80\x99s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\r\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when\r\nthey cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like\r\na poker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a natural\r\nphenomenon, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, because on account of the...\r\n\r\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science\r\nand this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered\r\nmedical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the\r\ncervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,\r\naccording to the best approved tradition of medical science, be\r\ncalculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent\r\nganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,\r\nthereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly\r\ndilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood\r\nto that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ\r\nresulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a\r\nmorbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo\r\nmortis per diminutionem capitis._\r\n\r\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and\r\nhe starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard\r\nand the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe\r\nwith him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported\r\nfor the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,\r\nthat and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a\r\nnew dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all\r\nround the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob\r\nDoran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could\r\nget. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw\r\nhere! Give us the paw!\r\n\r\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he\xe2\x80\x99d paw and Alf trying to keep him from\r\ntumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking\r\nall kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and\r\nintelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few\r\nbits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs\xe2\x80\x99 tin he told Terry to\r\nbring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging\r\nout of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry\r\nbloody mongrel.\r\n\r\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the\r\nbrothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet\r\nand die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown\r\ncigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he\r\nmarried is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.\r\nTime they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me\r\nthere was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and\r\nBloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing\r\nb\xc3\xa9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating\r\nmeat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and\r\ntaking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of\r\nDublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought\r\nhim home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him\r\nthe evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn\xe2\x80\x99t near\r\nroast him, it\xe2\x80\x99s a queer story, the old one, Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s wife and Mrs O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd\r\nthat kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them\r\noff chewing the fat. And Bloom with his _but don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?_ and _but\r\non the other hand_. And sure, more be token, the lout I\xe2\x80\x99m told was in\r\nPower\xe2\x80\x99s after, the blender\xe2\x80\x99s, round in Cope street going home footless\r\nin a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the\r\nsamples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and\r\nglaring at Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen. _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love\r\nare by our side and the foes we hate before us.\r\n\r\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far\r\nand near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the\r\ngloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums\r\npunctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening\r\nclaps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the\r\nghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its\r\nsupernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain\r\npoured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared\r\nheads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest\r\ncomputation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin\r\nMetropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person\r\nmaintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and\r\nreed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on\r\ntheir blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from\r\nthe cradle by Speranza\xe2\x80\x99s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains\r\nand upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our\r\ncountry cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable\r\namusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and\r\nM-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual\r\nmirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade\r\nwith their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody\r\nwho has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will\r\ngrudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and\r\nFemale Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the\r\nscene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the\r\nPoor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and\r\nmotherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal\r\nhouseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their\r\nExcellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while\r\nthe picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald\r\nIsle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation,\r\npresent in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone\r\n(the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his\r\nseat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul\r\nPetit\xc3\xa9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the\r\nArchjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha\r\nVir\xc3\xa1ga Kis\xc3\xa1szony Putr\xc3\xa1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos\r\nKaramelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Se\xc3\xb1or Hidalgo\r\nCaballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la\r\nMalaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen,\r\nMynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr\r\nKratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident\r\nHans Chuechli-Steuerli,\r\nNationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge\r\nneralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the\r\ndelegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest\r\npossible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which\r\nthey had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which\r\nall took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth\r\nor the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npatron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,\r\nboomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,\r\ncatapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to\r\nand blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable\r\nMacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly\r\nrestored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth\r\nof the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending\r\nparties. The readywitted ninefooter\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion at once appealed to\r\nall and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily\r\ncongratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of whom were bleeding\r\nprofusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from\r\nunderneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal\r\nadviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his\r\nthirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the\r\npockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their\r\nsenses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their\r\nrightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless\r\nmorning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus\r\nCruentus_. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough\r\nwhich so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\xe2\x80\x94short, painstaking\r\nyet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the\r\nworldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the\r\nhuge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in\r\ntheir excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates\r\ncheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,\r\nchinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing\r\n_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling\r\nthose piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani\r\nbeglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It\r\nwas exactly seventeen o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly\r\ngiven by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the\r\ncommendatore\xe2\x80\x99s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession\r\nof his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his\r\nmedical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who\r\nadministered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when\r\nabout to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a\r\npool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to\r\nthe throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hard by the block\r\nstood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in\r\na tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which\r\nhis eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested\r\nthe edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or\r\ndecapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been\r\nprovided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a\r\nhandsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering\r\nknife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially\r\nsupplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and\r\nSons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the\r\nduodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully\r\nextracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most\r\nprecious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the\r\namalgamated cats\xe2\x80\x99 and dogs\xe2\x80\x99 home was in attendance to convey these\r\nvessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an\r\nexcellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and\r\nonions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and\r\ninvigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for\r\nthe consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital\r\nspirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the\r\nproceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in\r\nthese our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying\r\nwish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in\r\naliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nassociation as a token of his regard and esteem. The _nec_ and _non\r\nplus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst\r\nher way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself\r\nupon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into\r\neternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving\r\nembrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_. Encouraged by this use of\r\nher christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable\r\nareas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her\r\nardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of\r\ntheir tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would\r\nnever forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips\r\nas if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She\r\nbrought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood\r\ntogether on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the\r\ninnocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,\r\nthey both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable\r\npastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply\r\nrocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped\r\ntheir hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from\r\ntheir lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the\r\ninmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being\r\nthe aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and\r\ngenial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of\r\ntheir handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye\r\nin that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a\r\nhandsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair\r\nsex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and\r\ngenealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,\r\nrequesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every\r\nlady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the\r\noccasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and\r\ngenerous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the\r\ngallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most\r\ntimehonoured names in Albion\xe2\x80\x99s history) placed on the finger of his\r\nblushing _fianc\xc3\xa9e_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in\r\nthe form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay,\r\neven the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell\r\nffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had\r\nblown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without\r\nflinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed\r\ngauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those\r\nprivileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to\r\nmurmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it\r\nmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause\r\nI thinks of my old mashtub what\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for me down Limehouse way.\r\n\r\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the\r\ncorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\ntheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a\r\nquid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he\r\ncadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the\r\nantitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is\r\nabout the size of it. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99d let you pour all manner of drink down\r\nhis throat till the Lord would call him before you\xe2\x80\x99d ever see the froth\r\nof his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their\r\nmusical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of\r\nhay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly\r\nblue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen\r\nbawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and\r\noranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh\r\nentertainment, don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And\r\nthen an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers\r\nshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two\r\nsky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the\r\nfemales, hitting below the belt.\r\n\r\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty\r\nstarts mousing around by Joe and me. I\xe2\x80\x99d train him by kindness, so I\r\nwould, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again\r\nwhere it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\r\n\r\nSo he calls the old dog over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s on you, Garry? says he.\r\n\r\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the\r\nold towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.\r\nSuch growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone\r\nthat has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono\r\npublico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of\r\nthat. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth\r\nis in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\r\n\r\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the\r\nlower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not\r\nmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the\r\nfamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_\r\nof Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends\r\nand acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of\r\nyears of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary\r\nsystem, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.\r\nOur greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from\r\nus!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and\r\ncompare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_\r\nresemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic\r\nbards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with\r\nwhich the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym\r\nof the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but\r\nrather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting\r\ncommunication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and\r\nmore personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the\r\nfamous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more\r\nmodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a\r\nspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar\r\nwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we\r\nbelieve that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more\r\nthan an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which\r\nrecalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh\r\nenglyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will\r\nagree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added\r\nthat the effect is greatly increased if Owen\xe2\x80\x99s verse be spoken somewhat\r\nslowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\r\n\r\n     The curse of my curses\r\n     Seven days every day\r\n     And seven dry Thursdays\r\n     On you, Barney Kiernan,\r\n     Has no sup of water\r\n     To cool my courage,\r\n     And my guts red roaring\r\n     After Lowry\xe2\x80\x99s lights.\r\n\r\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could\r\nhear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there\xe2\x80\x99s no ill feeling.\r\n\r\nGob, he\xe2\x80\x99s not as green as he\xe2\x80\x99s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one\r\npub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap\xe2\x80\x99s dog\r\nand getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for\r\nman and beast. And says Joe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Could you make a hole in another pint?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Could a swim duck? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything in\r\nthe way of liquid refreshment? says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet\r\nMartin Cunningham, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, about this insurance of poor\r\nDignam\xe2\x80\x99s. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I\r\nmean, didn\xe2\x80\x99t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the\r\ntime and nominally under the act the mortgagee can\xe2\x80\x99t recover on the\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good one if old Shylock is\r\nlanded. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a point, says Bloom, for the wife\xe2\x80\x99s admirers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whose admirers? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The wife\xe2\x80\x99s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\r\n\r\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act\r\nlike the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit\r\nof the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that\r\nDignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow\r\ncontested the mortgagee\xe2\x80\x99s right till he near had the head of me addled\r\nwith his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t run in\r\nhimself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a\r\nfriend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal\r\nHungarian privileged lottery. True as you\xe2\x80\x99re there. O, commend me to an\r\nisraelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\r\n\r\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he\r\nwas sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and\r\nto tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was\r\nnever a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that\xe2\x80\x99s dead to tell her.\r\nChoking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s hand doing the tragic\r\nto tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You\xe2\x80\x99re a rogue and I\xe2\x80\x99m another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however\r\nslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is\r\nfounded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to\r\nrequest of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits\r\nof reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my\r\nboldness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which\r\nactuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me\r\nconsoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,\r\nthis proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness\r\nof the cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,\r\nI feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the\r\nexpressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose\r\npoignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the\r\nbobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after\r\nclosing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard,\r\ndrinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the\r\nshawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he\r\nserving mass in Adam and Eve\xe2\x80\x99s when he was young with his eyes shut,\r\nwho wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and\r\nsmugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his\r\npockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed\r\nand the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. _How is your\r\ntestament? Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing\r\nthere, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little\r\nconcubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the\r\nchapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as\r\npie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s sister. And the old\r\nprostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack\r\nmade him toe the line. Told him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t patch up the pot, Jesus,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d kick the shite out of him.\r\n\r\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Slan leat_, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\r\n\r\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small\r\nfortune to keep him in drinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Friend of yours, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention any names, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William\r\nField, M. P., the cattle traders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of\r\nall countries and the idol of his own.\r\n\r\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and\r\nthe cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen\r\nsending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his\r\nsheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the\r\nguaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a\r\nknacker\xe2\x80\x99s yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here\xe2\x80\x99s my head\r\nand my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot\r\nfor giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how\r\nto milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used\r\nto be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd crying her eyes out\r\nwith her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t loosen her farting\r\nstrings but old cod\xe2\x80\x99s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do\r\nit. What\xe2\x80\x99s your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor\r\nanimals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d have a soft hand under a hen.\r\n\r\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for\r\nus. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then\r\ncomes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her\r\nfresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London\r\nto ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see\r\nhim, as it happens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr\r\nField is going. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t phone. No. You\xe2\x80\x99re sure?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nannan\xe2\x80\x99s going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question\r\ntomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the\r\npark. What do you think of that, citizen? _The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.\r\n\r\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my\r\nhonourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right\r\nhonourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that\r\nthese animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is\r\nforthcoming as to their pathological condition?\r\n\r\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in\r\npossession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole\r\nhouse. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the\r\nhonourable member\xe2\x80\x99s question is in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nMr Orelli O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued\r\nfor the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the\r\nPhoenix park?\r\n\r\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\r\n\r\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s famous\r\nMitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury\r\nbench? (O! O!)\r\n\r\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\r\n\r\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to shoot.\r\n\r\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\r\n\r\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\r\n\r\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There\r\nhe is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion\r\nof all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best\r\nthrow, citizen?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a\r\ntime I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that really a fact? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Bloom. That\xe2\x80\x99s well known. Did you not know that?\r\n\r\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of\r\nlawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil\r\nand building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course\r\nBloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nviolent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a\r\nstraw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.\r\nDo you see that straw? That\xe2\x80\x99s a straw_. Declare to my aunt he\xe2\x80\x99d talk\r\nabout it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\r\n\r\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Ciarnain\xe2\x80\x99s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of\r\n_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the\r\nimportance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and\r\nancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The\r\nvenerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the\r\nattendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by\r\nthe chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,\r\na most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high\r\nstandard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the\r\nrevivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic\r\nforefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of\r\nour old tongue, Mr Joseph M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for\r\nthe resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised\r\nmorning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best\r\ntraditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient\r\nages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,\r\nhaving espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the\r\ndiscussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty\r\nplaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy\r\nrendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis\xe2\x80\x99 evergreen verses\r\n(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in\r\nthe execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without\r\nfear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish\r\nCaruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were\r\nheard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only\r\nour citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its\r\nsuperquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was\r\nvociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be\r\nnoticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives\r\nof the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The\r\nproceedings then terminated.\r\n\r\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L.\r\nL. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S.\r\nSp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev.\r\nP. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr.\r\nNicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T.\r\nMaher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery,\r\nV. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O.\r\nM.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev.\r\nM. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D.\r\nScally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy\r\ncanon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P.\r\nFay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that\r\nKeogh-Bennett match?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? Blazes? says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd says Bloom:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training\r\nthe eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up\r\nthe odds and he swatting all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We know him, says the citizen. The traitor\xe2\x80\x99s son. We know what put\r\nEnglish gold in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94True for you, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the\r\nblood, asking Alf:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Bergan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only\r\na bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See\r\nthe little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,\r\nhe gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made\r\nhim puke what he never ate.\r\n\r\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were\r\nscheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.\r\nHandicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s pet lamb made up\r\nfor it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks\r\nwas a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had\r\ntapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had\r\nbeen receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in\r\nsome neat work on the pet\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The\r\nsoldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which\r\nthe Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the\r\npoint of Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him\r\nwith a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to\r\nhandigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout\r\nending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The\r\nEnglishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he\r\nwas liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey\r\nand brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in\r\njigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two\r\nfought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice\r\ncautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his\r\nfootwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during\r\nwhich a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from\r\nhis opponent\xe2\x80\x99s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and\r\nlanded a terrific left to Battling Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s stomach, flooring him\r\nflat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the\r\nPortobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s second Ole\r\nPfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared\r\nvictor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the\r\nringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrunning a concert tour now up in the north.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is, says Joe. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite true. Yes, a kind of summer\r\ntour, you see. Just a holiday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My wife? says Bloom. She\xe2\x80\x99s singing, yes. I think it will be a success\r\ntoo. He\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\r\n\r\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the\r\ncocoanut and absence of hair on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s chest. Blazes doing the\r\ntootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger\xe2\x80\x99s son off\r\nIsland bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to\r\nfight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate,\r\nMr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe bucko that\xe2\x80\x99ll organise her, take my tip. \xe2\x80\x99Twixt me and you\r\nCaddareesh.\r\n\r\nPride of Calpe\xe2\x80\x99s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There\r\ngrew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The\r\ngardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.\r\nThe chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\r\n\r\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s, a comely hero\r\nof white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty\xe2\x80\x99s counsel learned\r\nin the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of\r\nLambert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God save you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Save you kindly, says J. J. What\xe2\x80\x99ll it be, Ned?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half one, says Ned.\r\n\r\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Were you round at the court? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J. He\xe2\x80\x99ll square that, Ned, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hope so, says Ned.\r\n\r\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list\r\nand the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nPlaying cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their\r\neye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee\r\norders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where\r\nno-one would know him in the private office when I was there with\r\nPisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name, sir?\r\nDunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come home by weeping\r\ncross one of those days, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only\r\nCorny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting\r\nexamined first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to\r\nhear him before a judge and jury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and\r\nnothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Me? says Alf. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cast your nasturtiums on my character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence\r\nagainst you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not\r\n_compos mentis_. U. p: up.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he\xe2\x80\x99s balmy?\r\nLook at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat\r\non with a shoehorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an\r\nindictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half\r\nand half.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that\xe2\x80\x99s neither fish\r\nnor flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nor good red herring, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That what\xe2\x80\x99s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what\r\nthat is.\r\n\r\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on\r\naccount of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old\r\nstuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody\r\npovertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,\r\nbringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she\r\nmarried him because a cousin of his old fellow\xe2\x80\x99s was pewopener to the\r\npope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal\r\nZouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.\r\nAnd who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven\r\nshillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding\r\ndefiance to the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be\r\nsufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my\r\nopinion an action might lie.\r\n\r\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our\r\npints in peace. Gob, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be let even do that much itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good health, Ned, says J. J.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94-There he is again, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where? says Alf.\r\n\r\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter\r\nand the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in\r\nas they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a\r\nsecondhand coffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Remanded, says J. J.\r\n\r\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James\r\nWought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers\r\nsaying he\xe2\x80\x99d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see\r\nany green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?\r\nSwindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and\r\nhis own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew\r\nZaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,\r\nswearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who tried the case? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Recorder, says Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears\r\nof rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he\xe2\x80\x99ll dissolve\r\nin tears on the bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn\xe2\x80\x99t clap him in the dock\r\nthe other day for suing poor little Gumley that\xe2\x80\x99s minding stones, for\r\nthe corporation there near Butt bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?\r\nTen, did you say?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court\r\nimmediately, sir. No, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make no order for payment. How dare\r\nyou, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor\r\nhardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and\r\nin the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,\r\nthe daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first\r\nquarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the\r\nhalls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave\r\nhis rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the\r\nprobate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first\r\nchargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and\r\nfinal testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of\r\nthe late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus\r\nLivingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn\r\ncourt of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat\r\nhim there about the hour of five o\xe2\x80\x99clock to administer the law of the\r\nbrehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in\r\nand for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the\r\nhigh sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of\r\nthe tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen\r\nand of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of\r\nFergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the\r\ntribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte\r\nand of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and\r\ntrue. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should\r\nwell and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined\r\nbetween their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and\r\ntrue verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss\r\nthe book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they\r\nswore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His\r\nrightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from\r\ntheir donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended\r\nin consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and\r\nfoot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge\r\nagainst him for he was a malefactor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland\r\nfilling the country with bugs.\r\n\r\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,\r\ntelling him he needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about that little matter till the first\r\nbut if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high\r\nand holy by this and by that he\xe2\x80\x99d do the devil and all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have\r\nrepetition. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rely on me, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We\r\nwant no more strangers in our house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that\r\nKeyes, you see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Consider that done, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very kind of you, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.\r\nWe brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon\r\nrobbers here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Decree _nisi,_ says J. J.\r\n\r\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a\r\nspider\xe2\x80\x99s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling\r\nafter him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite\r\nand when.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the cause of all\r\nour misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_\r\nwith Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us a squint at her, says I.\r\n\r\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows\r\noff of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts.\r\nMisconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago\r\ncontractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.\r\nBelle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling\r\nfor her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter\r\njust in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with\r\nofficer Taylor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off\r\nof that one, what?\r\n\r\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on\r\nhim as long as a late breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says the citizen, what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest from the scene of action?\r\nWhat did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide\r\nabout the Irish language?\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the\r\npuissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of\r\nthat which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient\r\ncity, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,\r\nafter due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken\r\nsolemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once\r\nmore into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided\r\nGael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal\r\nSassenachs and their _patois._\r\n\r\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till\r\nyou heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting\r\nyour blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to\r\nimpeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and\r\nbotheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them!\r\nThe curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody\r\nthicklugged sons of whores\xe2\x80\x99 gets! No music and no art and no literature\r\nworthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us.\r\nTonguetied sons of bastards\xe2\x80\x99 ghosts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The European family, says J. J....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin\r\nEgan of Paris. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a trace of them or their language\r\nanywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d\xe2\x80\x99aisance._\r\n\r\nAnd says John Wyse:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\r\n\r\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_\r\n\r\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the\r\nmedher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh\r\nDearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty\r\nvalorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster\r\nsilent as the deathless gods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had\r\nlost a bob and found a tanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gold cup, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Bass\xe2\x80\x99s mare? says Terry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still running, says he. We\xe2\x80\x99re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid\r\non my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn\r\ngave me. Lord Howard de Walden\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. _Throwaway,_\r\nsays he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy\r\nname is _Sceptre._\r\n\r\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was\r\nanything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his\r\nluck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not there, my child, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She\xe2\x80\x99d have won the money only for the\r\nother dog.\r\n\r\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom\r\nsticking in an odd word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others\xe2\x80\x99 eyes but they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see the beam in their own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Raimeis_, says the citizen. There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one as blind as the fellow\r\nthat won\xe2\x80\x99t see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing\r\ntwenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost\r\ntribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!\r\nAnd our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax\r\nand our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our\r\ntanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our\r\nHuguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk\r\nand our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite\r\nconvent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are\r\nthe Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the\r\nGibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian\r\npurple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and\r\nPtolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble,\r\nsilver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,\r\nthe Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs\r\nduties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of\r\nAnglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds\r\nof the Barrow and Shannon they won\xe2\x80\x99t deepen with millions of acres of\r\nmarsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As treeless as Portugal we\xe2\x80\x99ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland\r\nwith its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.\r\nLarches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I\r\nwas reading a report of lord Castletown\xe2\x80\x99s...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain\r\nelm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the\r\ntrees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of\r\nEire, O.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon\r\nat the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief\r\nranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine\r\nValley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,\r\nMrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs\r\nClyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss\r\nVirginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche\r\nMaple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower,\r\nMiss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel\r\nCedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,\r\nMrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs\r\nLiana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of\r\nOakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was\r\ngiven away by her father, the M\xe2\x80\x99Conifer of the Glands, looked\r\nexquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised\r\nsilk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of\r\nbroad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,\r\nthe scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn\r\nbronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce\r\nConifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same\r\ntone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a\r\npinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form\r\nof heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at\r\nthe organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed\r\nnumbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of\r\n_Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service. On leaving\r\nthe church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the\r\nhappy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,\r\nbeechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,\r\nmistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan\r\nwill spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with\r\nSpain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were\r\npupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And will again, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the\r\ncitizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full\r\nagain, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom\r\nof Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a\r\nfleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O\xe2\x80\x99Reillys and the\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with\r\nthe emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when\r\nthe first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own\r\nflag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor\xe2\x80\x99s harps, no, the oldest flag\r\nafloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns\r\non a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\r\n\r\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like\r\na tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody\r\nlife is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled\r\nmultitude in Shanagolden where he daren\xe2\x80\x99t show his nose with the Molly\r\nMaguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the\r\nholding of an evicted tenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you\r\nasleep?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\r\n\r\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead\r\nof attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying\r\nto crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his\r\nhead down like a bull at a gate. And another one: _Black Beast Burned\r\nin Omaha, Ga_. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing\r\nat a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under\r\nhim. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and\r\ncrucify him to make sure of their job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at\r\nbay?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.\r\nRead the revelations that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the papers about flogging on\r\nthe training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself\r\n_Disgusted One_.\r\n\r\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of\r\ntars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the\r\nparson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad\r\nbrought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend\r\nof a gun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John\r\nBeresford called it but the modern God\xe2\x80\x99s Englishman calls it caning on\r\nthe breech.\r\n\r\nAnd says John Wyse:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\r\n\r\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane\r\nand he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad\r\ntill he yells meila murder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the\r\nearth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary\r\nchamber on the face of God\xe2\x80\x99s earth and their land in the hands of a\r\ndozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That\xe2\x80\x99s the great empire they\r\nboast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The\r\nunfortunate yahoos believe it.\r\n\r\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,\r\nand in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,\r\nborn of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was\r\nscarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day\r\nhe arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend\r\ntill further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But, says Bloom, isn\xe2\x80\x99t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit be the same here if you put force against force?\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you? As true as I\xe2\x80\x99m drinking this porter if he was at his\r\nlast gasp he\xe2\x80\x99d try to downface you that dying was living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater\r\nIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the\r\nblack 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid\r\nlow by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the\r\nwhitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as\r\nredskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the\r\nSassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of\r\ncrops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,\r\nthey drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in\r\nthe coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember\r\nthe land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no\r\ncravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the\r\npoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at\r\nKillala.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us\r\nagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the\r\nbroken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the\r\nwild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, duke of Tetuan\r\nin Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria\r\nTeresa. But what did we ever get for it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what\r\nit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ntrying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay\xe2\x80\x99s dinnerparty with\r\nperfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Conspuez les Fran\xc3\xa7ais_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\nhad enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George\r\nthe elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndead?\r\n\r\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old\r\none with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every\r\nnight of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman\r\ncarting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by\r\nthe whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the\r\nRhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody sight more pox\r\nthan pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and\r\nbishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his\r\njockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little\r\nAlf.\r\n\r\nAnd says J. J.:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Considerations of space influenced their lordships\xe2\x80\x99 decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, says he. I will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Repeat that dose, says Joe.\r\n\r\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with\r\nhis dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.\r\nPerpetuating national hatred among nations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that\xe2\x80\x99s so I\xe2\x80\x99m a nation for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nliving in the same place for the past five years.\r\n\r\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to\r\nmuck out of it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or also living in different places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That covers my case, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,\r\ngob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to\r\nswab himself dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and\r\nrepeat after me the following words.\r\n\r\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth\r\nattributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,\r\nauthors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and\r\ncalled forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary\r\nbeauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly\r\ndiscern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the\r\nfour masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American\r\npuma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said\r\nin passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The\r\nscenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and\r\nraths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive\r\nstones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as\r\nwhen the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy\r\nlong long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely\r\nlakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh\r\nand the Twelve Pins, Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh\r\nPatrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company\r\n(Limited), Lough Neagh\xe2\x80\x99s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde\xe2\x80\x99s tower, the\r\nMapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun\xe2\x80\x99s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of\r\nAherlow, Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at\r\nLoughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids,\r\nKilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, S.\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory,\r\nCurley\xe2\x80\x99s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,\r\nthe rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse,\r\nFingal\xe2\x80\x99s Cave\xe2\x80\x94all these moving scenes are still there for us today\r\nrendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed\r\nover them and by the rich incrustations of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.\r\nAlso now. This very moment. This very instant.\r\n\r\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs\r\nto us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold\r\nby auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about injustice, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old\r\nlardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99d adorn a\r\nsweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s apron on him. And\r\nthen he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as\r\nlimp as a wet rag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But it\xe2\x80\x99s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nlife for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the very opposite of that that is really life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says\r\nhe to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is\r\nthere. If he comes just say I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a second. Just a moment.\r\n\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says John Wyse. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what we\xe2\x80\x99re told. Love your neighbour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,\r\nmoya! He\xe2\x80\x99s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\r\n\r\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A\r\nloves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.\r\nM. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.\r\nJumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with\r\nthe ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man\r\nin the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King\r\nloves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor.\r\nYou love a certain person. And this person loves that other person\r\nbecause everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power,\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hurrah, there, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.\r\nWhat about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women\r\nand children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_\r\npasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit\r\nin the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that\xe2\x80\x99s visiting\r\nEngland?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? says Joe.\r\n\r\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts\r\nreading out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented\r\nyesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in\r\nWaiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the\r\nheartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in\r\nhis dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of\r\nwhich the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely\r\ntranslated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod\r\nBarebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the\r\ncordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,\r\nstating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an\r\nilluminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x99s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief\r\nwoman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the\r\naugust hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of\r\nfirstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of\r\nhis immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty\r\nWarts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and\r\nsigned his mark in the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 book, subsequently executing a\r\ncharming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed\r\nseveral knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt her. Wonder did he put that\r\nbible to the same use as I would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land\r\nthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says the citizen. It\xe2\x80\x99s not signed Shanganagh. It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\ninitialled: P.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And a very good initial too, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says J. J., if they\xe2\x80\x99re any worse than those Belgians in the\r\nCongo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s this his name is?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Casement, says the citizen. He\xe2\x80\x99s an Irishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and\r\nflogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they\r\ncan out of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on\r\n_Throwaway_ and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to gather in the shekels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a\r\nhorse in anger in his life?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back\r\nthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.\r\nBet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nonly man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There you are, says Terry.\r\n\r\nGoodbye Ireland I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the\r\nyard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was\r\nletting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I\r\nto myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in\r\nSlattery\xe2\x80\x99s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings\r\nis five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was\r\ntelling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have\r\ndone about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbetter_ or _she\xe2\x80\x99s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool\r\nif he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!)\r\nIreland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody\r\n(there\xe2\x80\x99s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\r\n\r\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it\r\nwas Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper\r\nall kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off\r\nof the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk\r\nabout selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that\r\nputs the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.\r\nGive us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody\r\nmouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before\r\nhim perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that\r\npoisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country\r\nwith his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.\r\nAny amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No\r\nsecurity. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99s like Lanty MacHale\xe2\x80\x99s goat that\xe2\x80\x99d go a piece of the\r\nroad with every one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, says John Wyse. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the man now that\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\r\n\r\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power\r\nwith him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the\r\ncollector general\xe2\x80\x99s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the\r\nregistration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the\r\ncountry at the king\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\r\n\r\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their\r\npalfreys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.\r\nSaucy knave! To us!\r\n\r\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\r\n\r\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.\r\nAnd for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare\r\nlarder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant\r\ncountenance, So servest thou the king\xe2\x80\x99s messengers, master Taptun?\r\n\r\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s visage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmessengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my\r\nhouse I warrant me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty\r\ntrencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\r\n\r\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of\r\nvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog\xe2\x80\x99s bacon, a boar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a\r\nflagon of old Rhenish?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare\r\nlarder, quotha! \xe2\x80\x99Tis a merry rogue.\r\n\r\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen\r\nabout Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who made those allegations? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I, says Joe. I\xe2\x80\x99m the alligator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And after all, says John Wyse, why can\xe2\x80\x99t a jew love his country like\r\nthe next fellow?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why not? says J. J., when he\xe2\x80\x99s quite sure which country it is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the\r\nhell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is Junius? says J. J.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We don\xe2\x80\x99t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was\r\nhe drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know\r\nthat in the castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the\r\nfather did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints\r\nand sages!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that\r\nmatter so are we.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J., and every male that\xe2\x80\x99s born they think it may be their\r\nMessiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe,\r\ntill he knows if he\xe2\x80\x99s a father or a mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his\r\nthat died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying\r\na tin of Neave\xe2\x80\x99s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_En ventre sa m\xc3\xa8re_, says J. J.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\r\n\r\nGob, there\xe2\x80\x99s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed\r\nmiddlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a\r\nmonth with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntelling you? It\xe2\x80\x99d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like\r\nof that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it\r\nwould. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of\r\nstuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind\r\nyour eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A wolf in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s clothing, says the citizen. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he is. Virag\r\nfrom Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,\r\nsays the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Amen, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure He will, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with\r\nacolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and\r\nsubdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors\r\nand guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,\r\nCarthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and\r\nVallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,\r\nPremonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter\r\nNolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet\r\nled by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and\r\nfriars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,\r\nminimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of\r\nDominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks\r\nof S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the\r\nchristian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice.\r\nAnd after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr\r\nand S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and\r\nS. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites\r\nand S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S.\r\nLeugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent\r\nde Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and\r\nS. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard\r\nand S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and\r\nS. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous\r\nand S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O\xe2\x80\x99Toole and S. James of Dingle and\r\nCompostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S.\r\nColman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S.\r\nFachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and\r\nS. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of\r\nBrittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of\r\nholy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John\r\nBerchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S.\r\nBride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam\r\nand S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus\r\nand Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo\r\nand S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid\r\nand S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and\r\nthe Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S.\r\nScholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came\r\nwith nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords\r\nand olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of\r\ntheir efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,\r\ntrees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,\r\ndragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,\r\nsoupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,\r\nforceps, stags\xe2\x80\x99 horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a\r\ndish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way\r\nby Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little\r\nBritain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which\r\nbeginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual\r\n_Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as\r\ncasting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes,\r\nhealing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had\r\nbeen mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and\r\nprophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the\r\nreverend Father O\xe2\x80\x99Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the\r\ngood fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard\r\nKiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale\r\ngrocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine\r\nand spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the\r\nhouse and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults\r\nand the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and\r\nthe engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the\r\nlintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that\r\nhouse as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and\r\nmake the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he\r\nblessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed\r\nanswered his prayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Qui fecit c\xc5\x93lum et terram._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Dominus vobiscum._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Et cum spiritu tuo._\r\n\r\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he\r\nprayed and they all with him prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde\r\nsuper creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et\r\nvoluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem\r\nsanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et anim\xc3\xa6 tutelam Te auctore\r\npercipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And so say all of us, says Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\r\n\r\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike\r\nwhen be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says Martin, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\r\n\r\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.\r\nMean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Beg your pardon, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bye bye all, says Martin.\r\n\r\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or\r\nwhatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be\r\nall at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.\r\n\r\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop\r\nthe helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off\r\nforward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely\r\nnymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the\r\nsides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the\r\ncunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the\r\nequidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds\r\nthem all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas\r\nthey ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so\r\ndid they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.\r\nAnd they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark\r\nclave the waves.\r\n\r\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the\r\ncitizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the\r\ndropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and\r\ncandle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little\r\nAlf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let me alone, says he.\r\n\r\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls\r\nout of him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three cheers for Israel!\r\n\r\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ\xe2\x80\x99 sake\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about\r\nbloody nothing. Gob, it\xe2\x80\x99d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and\r\nMartin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and\r\nAlf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews\r\nand the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him\r\nto sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a\r\npatch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,\r\njew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\r\n\r\nAnd says he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And\r\nthe Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had no father, says Martin. That\xe2\x80\x99ll do now. Drive ahead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whose God? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a\r\njew like me.\r\n\r\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By Jesus, says he, I\xe2\x80\x99ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy\r\nname. By Jesus, I\xe2\x80\x99ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stop! Stop! says Joe.\r\n\r\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from\r\nthe metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid\r\nfarewell to Nagyas\xc3\xa1gos uram Lip\xc3\xb3ti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander\r\nThom\xe2\x80\x99s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for\r\nthe distant clime of Sz\xc3\xa1zharminczbroj\xc3\xbaguly\xc3\xa1s-Dugul\xc3\xa1s (Meadow of\r\nMurmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great _\xc3\xa9clat_ was\r\ncharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll\r\nof ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to\r\nthe distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the\r\ncommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,\r\ntastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work\r\nwhich reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.\r\nThe departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of\r\nthose who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of\r\nIrish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,\r\nfollowed immediately by _Rak\xc3\xb3czsy\xe2\x80\x99s March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires\r\nwere lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the\r\nHill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains\r\nof Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the\r\nNagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid\r\ncheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a\r\nbig muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,\r\nthe mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final\r\nfloral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were\r\npresent in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,\r\nescorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and\r\nCustom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical\r\npower station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.\r\n_Visszontl\xc3\xa1t\xc3\xa1sra, kedv\xc3\xa9s bar\xc3\xa1tom! Visszontl\xc3\xa1t\xc3\xa1sra!_ Gone but not\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nGob, the devil wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin\r\nanyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he\r\nshouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroyal theatre:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is he till I murder him?\r\n\r\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloody wars, says I, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be in for the last gospel.\r\n\r\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag\xe2\x80\x99s head round the other\r\nway and off with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\r\n\r\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the\r\nsun was in his eyes or he\xe2\x80\x99d have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent\r\nit into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old\r\nmongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting\r\nand laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The\r\nobservatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the\r\nfifth grade of Mercalli\xe2\x80\x99s scale, and there is no record extant of a\r\nsimilar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,\r\nthe year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to\r\nhave been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn\xe2\x80\x99s Quay\r\nward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,\r\ntwo roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in\r\nthe vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble\r\nedifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal\r\ndebates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it\r\nis to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the\r\nreports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were\r\naccompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic\r\ncharacter. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the\r\nmuch respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a\r\nsilk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat\r\nof arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of\r\nquarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been\r\ndiscovered by search parties in remote parts of the island\r\nrespectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncauseway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in\r\nthe sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other\r\neyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of\r\nenormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying\r\nvelocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of\r\ncondolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the\r\ndifferent continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously\r\npleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be\r\ncelebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral\r\nchurch of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority\r\nof the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who\r\nhave been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of\r\nsalvage, removal of _d\xc3\xa9bris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to\r\nMessrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.\r\nand C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and\r\nofficers of the Duke of Cornwall\xe2\x80\x99s light infantry under the general\r\nsupervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir\r\nHercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C.,\r\nK. C. B., M. P., J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I.\r\nA., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P.\r\nI. and F. R. C. S. I.\r\n\r\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that\r\nlottery ticket on the side of his poll he\xe2\x80\x99d remember the gold cup, he\r\nwould so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and\r\nbattery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by\r\nfurious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And\r\nhe let a volley of oaths after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did I kill him, says he, or what?\r\n\r\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After him, Garry! After him, boy!\r\n\r\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old\r\nsheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his\r\nlugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.\r\nHundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld\r\nthe chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in\r\nthe chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having\r\nraiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they\r\ndurst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:\r\n_Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And\r\nthey beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels\r\nascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees\r\nover Donohoe\xe2\x80\x99s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 13 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious\r\nembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of\r\nall too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\r\npromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\r\nthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on\r\nthe quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the\r\nstillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a\r\nbeacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\r\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and\r\noft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy\r\nchat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy\r\nCaffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and\r\nJacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits\r\nwith caps to match and the name _H. M. S. Belleisle_ printed on both.\r\nFor Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very\r\nnoisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little\r\nfellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They\r\nwere dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building\r\ncastles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy\r\nas the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to\r\nand fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with\r\ndelight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a\r\ntiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy\r\nCaffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty\r\ndimple in his chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd baby prattled after her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A jink a jink a jawbo.\r\n\r\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of\r\nchildren, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could\r\nnever be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that\r\nheld his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown\r\nbread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But\r\nto be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in\r\nhis new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,\r\nwas Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,\r\nalways with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her\r\ncherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman\r\nlaughed too at the quaint language of little brother.\r\n\r\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and\r\nMaster Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to\r\nthis golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\r\nwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go\r\nwrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like\r\nthe Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky\r\nwas selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose\r\nthat the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the\r\ncoveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master\r\nTommy drew the attention of the girl friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\r\nJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I\r\ncatch you for that.\r\n\r\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for\r\ntheir big sister\xe2\x80\x99s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he\r\nwas too after his misadventure. His little man-o\xe2\x80\x99-war top and\r\nunmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the\r\nart of smoothing over life\xe2\x80\x99s tiny troubles and very quickly not one\r\nspeck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue\r\neyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed\r\naway the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and\r\nsaid if she was near him she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be far from him, her eyes dancing\r\nin admonition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\r\n\r\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s your name? Butter and cream?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your\r\nsweetheart?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nao, tearful Tommy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nao, Tommy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from\r\nher shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy\xe2\x80\x99s sweetheart. Gerty is\r\nTommy\xe2\x80\x99s sweetheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\nCissy\xe2\x80\x99s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy\r\nBoardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see and to mind he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wet his new tan shoes.\r\n\r\nBut who was Gerty?\r\n\r\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\r\ngazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a\r\nspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was\r\npronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,\r\nshe was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and\r\ngraceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had\r\nbeen taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the\r\nWidow Welch\xe2\x80\x99s female pills and she was much better of those discharges\r\nshe used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face\r\nwas almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth\r\nwas a genuine Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely\r\nveined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and\r\nqueen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used\r\nto wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple\r\ntold that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black\r\nout at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their\r\nlittle tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told\r\nher not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There\r\nwas an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which\r\nwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.\r\nHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in\r\nher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education\r\nGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the\r\nland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow\r\nand patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their\r\ndevoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that\r\nlent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed\r\nmeaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful\r\neyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery?\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and\r\ndark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily\r\nseductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful\r\npage of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try\r\neyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so\r\nbecoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then\r\nthere was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase\r\nyour height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would\r\nsuit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s crowning\r\nglory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a\r\nnatural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the\r\nnew moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of\r\nluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And\r\njust now at Edy\xe2\x80\x99s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest\r\nrosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet\r\ngirlish shyness that of a surety God\xe2\x80\x99s fair land of Ireland did not\r\nhold her equal.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was\r\nabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\r\nInclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\r\nThe pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out\r\ninto a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young\r\nMay morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy\r\nsay that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\r\nlovers\xe2\x80\x99 quarrel. As per usual somebody\xe2\x80\x99s nose was out of joint about\r\nthe boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding\r\nup and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in\r\nthe evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate\r\nthat was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a\r\ndoctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who\r\nwas racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little\r\nrecked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart\r\nsometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he\r\nmight learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family\r\nand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed\r\nVirgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an\r\nexquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the\r\nshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would\r\nknow anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the\r\nbicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice\r\nperfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size\r\ntoo he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so\r\nfrightfully clever because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go and ride up and down in front\r\nof her bit of a garden.\r\n\r\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\r\nDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\r\nout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because\r\nit was expected in the _Lady\xe2\x80\x99s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be\r\nworn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket\r\n(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\r\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy\r\nthreequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful\r\nfigure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of\r\nwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue\r\nchenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday\r\nweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she\r\nfound what she wanted at Clery\xe2\x80\x99s summer sales, the very it, slightly\r\nshopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.\r\nShe did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on\r\nthen, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to\r\nher! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew\r\nthat that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes\r\nwere the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she\r\nwas very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a\r\nfive, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one\r\nsmart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed\r\nits perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount\r\nand no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with\r\nhighspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet\r\nseventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in\r\nhis heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty\r\nstitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with\r\ndifferent coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,\r\nand she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the\r\nwash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because\r\nshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust those washerwomen as far as she\xe2\x80\x99d see them scorching\r\nthe things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her\r\nown colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on\r\nher because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his\r\nfather brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and\r\nbecause she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was\r\ndressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside\r\nout and that was for luck and lovers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting if you put those things\r\non inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so\r\nlong as it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of a Friday.\r\n\r\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\r\nthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give\r\nworlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving\r\nway to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings\r\nthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the\r\nmirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls\r\nupon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.\r\nYes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage\r\nhas been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.\r\nC. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs\r\nWylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was\r\nwearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox\r\nwas not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in\r\nlove, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an\r\narm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her\r\nlittle one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the\r\nfirst!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from\r\nthe room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength\r\nof character had never been Reggy Wylie\xe2\x80\x99s strong point and he who would\r\nwoo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting,\r\nalways waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be\r\nover. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous\r\nlove at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who\r\nhad not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,\r\nand who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her\r\nto him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort\r\nher with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she\r\nyearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be\r\nhis only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in\r\nhealth, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.\r\n\r\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\r\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\r\nlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue\r\nin the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she\r\nwould be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature\r\ncomforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked\r\nthat feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue\r\nand queen Ann\xe2\x80\x99s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden\r\nopinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a\r\nfire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same\r\ndirection, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of\r\neggs though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the eating part when there were any people\r\nthat made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat something\r\npoetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully\r\nappointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph\r\nof grandpapa Giltrap\xe2\x80\x99s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was\r\nso human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in\r\nClery\xe2\x80\x99s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be\r\ntall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a\r\nhusband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed\r\nsweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their\r\nhoneymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in\r\na nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both\r\nhave brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and\r\nbefore he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a\r\ngood hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.\r\n\r\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then\r\nshe buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run\r\noff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy\r\nsaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with\r\nthe ball and if he took it there\xe2\x80\x99d be wigs on the green but Tommy said\r\nit was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if\r\nyou please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy\r\nCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off\r\nnow with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It\xe2\x80\x99s my ball.\r\n\r\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\r\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand\r\nand Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\r\n\r\nAnd she tickled tiny tot\xe2\x80\x99s two cheeks to make him forget and played\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s the lord mayor, here\xe2\x80\x99s his two horses, here\xe2\x80\x99s his gingerbread\r\ncarriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper\r\nchin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way\r\nlike that from everyone always petting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\r\n\r\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\r\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she\xe2\x80\x99d be ashamed of her\r\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was\r\nsure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared\r\nCiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of\r\nher nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I\xe2\x80\x99d look at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.\r\nFor instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea\r\nand jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men\xe2\x80\x99s faces on\r\nher nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to\r\ngo where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the\r\nMiss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget\r\nher the evening she dressed up in her father\xe2\x80\x99s suit and hat and the\r\nburned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a\r\ncigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was\r\nsincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever\r\nmade, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the\r\npealing anthem of the organ. It was the men\xe2\x80\x99s temperance retreat\r\nconducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary,\r\nsermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there\r\ngathered together without distinction of social class (and a most\r\nedifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,\r\nafter the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the\r\nimmaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her\r\nto intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin\r\nof virgins. How sad to poor Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s ears! Had her father only avoided\r\nthe clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders\r\nthe drink habit cured in Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly, she might now be rolling in\r\nher carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that\r\nas she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp\r\nbecause she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window\r\ndreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.\r\nBut that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had\r\ncast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in\r\nthe home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen\r\nher own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself\r\ncompletely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it\r\nwas that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of\r\nkindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\r\n\r\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\r\nVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\r\nher companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman\r\noff Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\r\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\r\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\r\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face\r\n(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\r\npimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor\r\nfather! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,\r\nMary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they\r\nhad stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby\xe2\x80\x99s salad dressing for supper\r\nand when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died\r\nsuddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom\r\nand Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have\r\nhad a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now\r\nhe was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a\r\nwarning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even go to the\r\nfuneral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him\r\nthe letters and samples from his office about Catesby\xe2\x80\x99s cork lino,\r\nartistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and\r\nalways bright and cheery in the home.\r\n\r\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the\r\nhouse, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\r\ngold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\r\nit rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike her mother\xe2\x80\x99s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\r\nthing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the\r\nworld of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas\r\nat the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of\r\nthat place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime\r\nMr Tunney the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days\r\nwhere a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\r\nthreecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\r\noldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a\r\nstory behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a\r\nsoft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\r\nchocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them\r\ndreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own\r\narms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and\r\nthought about those times because she had found out in Walker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the\r\nhalcyon days what they meant.\r\n\r\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till\r\nat last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no\r\ngetting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\r\ncould down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was\r\nnot slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\r\nsitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\r\nthe ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries\r\nand to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it\r\nto her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then\r\nthrew it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the\r\nslope and stopped right under Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s skirt near the little pool by the\r\nrock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it\r\naway and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she\r\nwished their stupid ball hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come rolling down to her and she gave a\r\nkick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\r\n\r\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\r\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\r\nher skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball\r\na jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it\r\ndown towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else\r\nto draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She\r\nfelt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,\r\nsurging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged\r\nglances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she\r\nventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the\r\ntwilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\r\nand with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain\r\nof original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray\r\nfor us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And\r\ncareworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\r\nwho had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\r\nthat bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told\r\nthem what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,\r\nthe most pious Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s intercessory power that it was not recorded in\r\nany age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever\r\nabandoned by her.\r\n\r\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\r\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\r\nbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.\r\nPeep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was\r\nCissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my\r\nword, didn\xe2\x80\x99t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say\r\npapa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\r\n\r\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\r\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of\r\nhealth, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out\r\nto be something great, they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Haja ja ja haja.\r\n\r\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to\r\nsit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried\r\nout, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half\r\nblanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most\r\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\r\n\r\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all\r\nno use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\r\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave\r\nhim in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen\r\nwas quickly appeased.\r\n\r\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out\r\nof that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little\r\nbrats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the\r\npaintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\r\nchalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,\r\nthe evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and\r\nto hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they\r\nburned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart\r\nwent pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning\r\nin his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her\r\nthrough and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were,\r\nsuperbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer.\r\nShe could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face\r\nthat he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin\r\nHarvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred\r\nbecause she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they\r\ntwo to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see\r\nwhether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retrouss\xc3\xa9_ from where he\r\nwas sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story\r\nof a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given\r\nworlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still,\r\nand he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel\r\nbuckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the\r\ntoes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the\r\ntransparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was\r\nfar away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he\r\nwho mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him\r\nbecause she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very\r\nheart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she\r\nknew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against\r\nthan sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked\r\nman, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could\r\nconvert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted\r\nhealing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty\r\ngirls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she\r\ncould make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the\r\npast. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,\r\ncrushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for\r\nherself alone.\r\n\r\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. _Ora pro nobis_. Well\r\nhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy\r\ncan never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge\r\nfor the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her\r\nown heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the\r\nstained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue\r\nbanners of the blessed Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s sodality and Father Conroy was helping\r\nCanon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes\r\ncast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet\r\nand clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever\r\nshe became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come\r\nto the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time\r\nwhen she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots\r\nof her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was\r\nonly the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature\xe2\x80\x99s laws, he\r\nsaid, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the\r\nnature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady\r\nherself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to\r\nThy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and\r\nthought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design\r\nfor him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the\r\nmantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little\r\nhouse to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the\r\nforty hours\xe2\x80\x99 adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a\r\npresent to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or\r\nsome place.\r\n\r\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\r\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\r\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\r\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\r\nthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\r\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jacky! Tommy!\r\n\r\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\r\nlast time she\xe2\x80\x99d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and\r\nshe ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had\r\na good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\r\nthingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it to grow\r\nlong because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t natural so she could just go and throw her hat\r\nat it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn\xe2\x80\x99t rip\r\nup her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a\r\nlot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece\r\nwhenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just\r\nbecause she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see\r\nall the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as\r\npossible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up\r\nover something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French\r\nheels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. _Tableau!_\r\nThat would have been a very charming expos\xc3\xa9 for a gentleman like that\r\nto witness.\r\n\r\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\r\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy\r\nhanded the thurible to Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon and he put in the incense and\r\ncensed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and\r\nshe was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a\r\nbigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking\r\nthat he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon handed\r\nthe thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the\r\nBlessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she\r\njust swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to\r\nthe _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those\r\nstockings in Sparrow\xe2\x80\x99s of George\xe2\x80\x99s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday\r\nbefore Easter and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a brack on them and that was what he was\r\nlooking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had\r\nneither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his\r\nhead to see the difference for himself.\r\n\r\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\r\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\r\nstreel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought\r\nonly a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her\r\npetticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a\r\nmoment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown\r\ntresses was never seen on a girl\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders\xe2\x80\x94a radiant little vision,\r\nin sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel\r\nmany a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She\r\ncould almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes\r\nthat set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she\r\ncould see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster\r\nfor her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was\r\neying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct told her that\r\nshe had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet\r\nswept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a\r\nglorious rose.\r\n\r\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\r\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\r\nbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was\r\nwhy no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no\r\nconcern of hers. And she said to Gerty:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A penny for your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I\r\nwas only wondering was it late.\r\n\r\nBecause she wished to goodness they\xe2\x80\x99d take the snottynosed twins and\r\ntheir babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\r\ngave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy\r\nasked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was\r\nhalf past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know\r\nbecause they were told to be in early.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait, said Cissy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ntime by his conundrum.\r\n\r\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\r\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\r\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\r\nGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment\r\nhe had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and\r\nthe next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol\r\nexpressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\r\n\r\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\r\nright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to\r\nit and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry\r\nhis watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the\r\nsun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\r\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\r\nCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\r\nhis waterworks were out of order.\r\n\r\nThen they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon\r\ngot up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he\r\ntold Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire\r\nto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and\r\nshe could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the\r\nworks and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting\r\ndarker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was\r\nwinding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it\r\nback and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a\r\nsensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp\r\nand that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on\r\nbecause the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of\r\nthe moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her\r\nevery contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was\r\nundisguised admiration in a man\xe2\x80\x99s passionate gaze it was there plain to\r\nbe seen on that man\xe2\x80\x99s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\r\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect\r\nbecause it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\r\nto push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins\xe2\x80\x99 caps and tidied\r\ntheir hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon\r\nstood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed\r\nhim the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti\r\neis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and\r\nasking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just\r\nanswered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she\r\nheartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply.\r\nA brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn\r\nimmeasurable. It hurt\xe2\x80\x94O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet\r\nway of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded\r\nlittle cat she was. Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but\r\nshe fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,\r\nso beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.\r\nShe had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle\r\nlike all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and\r\nfor an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.\r\nTheir eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she\r\nsparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\r\nflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it\xe2\x80\x99s leap year.\r\n\r\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\r\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\r\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As\r\nfor Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\r\nhim aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\r\nmuch as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a\r\ndozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him\r\none look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.\r\nMiss puny little Edy\xe2\x80\x99s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty\r\ncould see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a\r\ntowering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft\r\nhad struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\r\nsomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and\r\nnever would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\r\nso they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\r\n\r\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked\r\nin the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because\r\nthe sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told\r\nhim too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and\r\nbaby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and\r\nCissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,\r\nwithout as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and\r\nsundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set\r\nthat little matter to rights.\r\n\r\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy\r\nasked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\r\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed\r\nit off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction\r\nbecause just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet\r\nseashore because Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that\r\nFather Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the\r\nBlessed Sacrament in his hands.\r\n\r\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse\r\nof Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time\r\na bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,\r\nthither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of\r\nthe lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of\r\npaints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the\r\nlamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church\r\ngrounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked\r\nand lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn\r\nhis freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss\r\nCummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales. For Gerty had her\r\ndreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a\r\nkeepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the\r\ncoralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of\r\nher toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was\r\nscrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure\r\ntrove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose\r\nscent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to\r\nchange when her things came home from the wash and there were some\r\nbeautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in\r\nHely\xe2\x80\x99s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if\r\nshe could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so\r\ndeeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening\r\nround the potherbs. _Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J\r\nWalsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt\r\nthou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient\r\nloveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the\r\nyears were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one\r\nshortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an\r\naccident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.\r\nBut it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there\r\nwould be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would\r\nmake the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his\r\nthoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his\r\ndays with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was\r\ndying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife\r\nor some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land\r\nof song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But\r\neven if\xe2\x80\x94what then? Would it make a very great difference? From\r\neverything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively\r\nrecoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the\r\naccommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and\r\ncoarse men with no respect for a girl\xe2\x80\x99s honour, degrading the sex and\r\nbeing taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be\r\njust good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other\r\nin spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was\r\nan old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She\r\nthought she understood. She would try to understand him because men\r\nwere so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white\r\nhands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would\r\nfollow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he\r\nwas her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was\r\nthe master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be\r\nwild, untrammelled, free.\r\n\r\nCanon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and\r\ngenuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then\r\nhe locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and\r\nFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, look, Cissy!\r\n\r\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over\r\nthe trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\r\n\r\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,\r\nhelterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy\r\nholding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fall running.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It\xe2\x80\x99s the bazaar fireworks.\r\n\r\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\r\ncall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she\r\ncould see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set\r\nher pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,\r\nand a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face,\r\npassion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were\r\nleft alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he\r\ncould be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of\r\ninflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working\r\nand a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the\r\nfireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall\r\nback looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she\r\nrevealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply\r\nsoft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his\r\nheart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of\r\nmen like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead\r\nsecret and made her swear she\xe2\x80\x99d never about the gentleman lodger that\r\nwas staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had\r\npictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and\r\nshe said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine\r\nsometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing\r\nlike that because there was all the difference because she could almost\r\nfeel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his\r\nhandsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nthe other thing before being married and there ought to be women\r\npriests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy\r\nCaffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes\r\nso that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nphotographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on\r\nthe way it did.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned\r\nback and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent\r\nand they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was\r\nand she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something\r\nqueer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And\r\nshe saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in\r\nthe tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went\r\nhigher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up\r\nafter it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused\r\nwith a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see\r\nher other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the\r\nskin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,\r\non account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and\r\nthen it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was\r\ntrembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full\r\nview high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or\r\nwading and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ashamed and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t either to look in that\r\nimmodest way like that because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist the sight of the\r\nwondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so\r\nimmodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She\r\nwould fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms\r\nto him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a\r\nyoung girl\xe2\x80\x99s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry\r\nthat has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot\r\nblind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh\r\nof O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a\r\nstream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all\r\ngreeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,\r\nsoft!\r\n\r\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She\r\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\r\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.\r\nHe was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is\r\nhe) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.\r\nWhat a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called\r\nto him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he\r\nhad been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in\r\nthose eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and\r\nsinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That\r\nwas their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there\r\nwas none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly\r\nthrough the evening to and fro and little bats don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\r\n\r\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to\r\nshow what a great person she was: and then she cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gerty! Gerty! We\xe2\x80\x99re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\r\n\r\nGerty had an idea, one of love\xe2\x80\x99s little ruses. She slipped a hand into\r\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of\r\ncourse without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nfar to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet\r\nagain, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her\r\ndream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their\r\nsouls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her\r\nheart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet\r\nflowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,\r\na smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.\r\n\r\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,\r\nto Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was\r\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and\r\nslippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic\r\nof her but with care and very slowly because\xe2\x80\x94because Gerty MacDowell\r\nwas...\r\n\r\nTight boots? No. She\xe2\x80\x99s lame! O!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That\xe2\x80\x99s why she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleft on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was\r\nwrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse\r\nin a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it when she was\r\non show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Curiosity like\r\na nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is\r\ndelicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I\r\nhave such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all\r\nright. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla\r\nconvent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the\r\nend I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha,\r\nshe. Something in the air. That\xe2\x80\x99s the moon. But then why don\xe2\x80\x99t all\r\nwomen menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends\r\non the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out\r\nof step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of\r\nthat. Damned glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it in the bath this morning over her\r\nsilly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this\r\nmorning. That gouger M\xe2\x80\x99Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife\r\nengagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for\r\nsmall mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it\r\nthemselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured\r\nout of offices. Reserve better. Don\xe2\x80\x99t want it they throw it at you.\r\nCatch em alive, O. Pity they can\xe2\x80\x99t see themselves. A dream of\r\nwellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel\r\nstreet: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy\xe2\x80\x99s hat and what the girls did\r\nwith it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? _Lingerie_\r\ndoes it. Felt for the curves inside her _d\xc3\xa9shabill\xc3\xa9._ Excites them also\r\nwhen they\xe2\x80\x99re. I\xe2\x80\x99m all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing\r\none another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly\xe2\x80\x99s new blouse.\r\nAt first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her\r\nthe violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and\r\nturnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we\r\nmet. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman\r\nloses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy\r\nlost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part\r\nof their charm. Just changes when you\xe2\x80\x99re on the track of the secret.\r\nExcept the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer\r\nrefused. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they\r\nare. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They\r\nbelieve in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to\r\ngive her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnecks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about\r\nnothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs\r\nand their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to\r\nyou. Now won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along,\r\nthen meet once in a blue moon. _Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the\r\nlove of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with\r\nyourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing\r\ntheir teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lend each\r\nother a pinch of salt.\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\r\nDevils they are when that\xe2\x80\x99s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.\r\nMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my\r\nfoot. O that way! O, that\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest\r\nonce in a way. Wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s bad to go with them then. Safe in one\r\nway. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering\r\nplants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she\r\nwears she\xe2\x80\x99s a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like\r\nthat you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look\r\nat. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and\r\nlions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or\r\nsomething. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike\r\nrough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me.\r\nWonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with\r\nbearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid\r\ngentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly\r\nmen marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can\xe2\x80\x99t be so if Molly.\r\nTook off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face,\r\nmeeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers\r\nto smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly\xe2\x80\x99s combings when\r\nwe were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her\r\nmoney. Why not? All a prejudice. She\xe2\x80\x99s worth ten, fifteen, more, a\r\npound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion.\r\nDid I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent\r\nto Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie\xe2\x80\x99s without a necktie. Wrangle\r\nwith Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four.\r\nDust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was\r\nthat just when he, she?\r\n\r\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that\r\nlittle limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not\r\npleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\r\nComplimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night\r\nprayers with the kiddies. Well, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? See her as she is spoil\r\nall. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.\r\nThe name too. _Amours_ of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud\r\nBranscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered\r\nwith pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel.\r\nThe strength it gives a man. That\xe2\x80\x99s the secret of it. Good job I let\r\noff there behind the wall coming out of Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s. Cider that was.\r\nOtherwise I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. Makes you want to sing after. _Lacaus esant\r\ntaratara_. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask\r\nyou another. Good idea if you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck. Gain time. But then you\xe2\x80\x99re in a\r\ncart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\non for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I\r\nnearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath\r\nstreet that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of\r\ncourse. My arks she called it. It\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to find one who. Aho! If\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they\r\nharden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.\r\nParrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncalled me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a\r\nsingle girl! That\xe2\x80\x99s what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman.\r\nOr even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other\r\nchap\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today\r\nspitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook.\r\nCause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think.\r\nCome in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they\r\nchange the venue when it\xe2\x80\x99s not what they like. Ask you do you like\r\nmushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what\r\nsomeone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I\r\nwent the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did.\r\nShe too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something\r\nawfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been\r\nthinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came\r\nto the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The\r\npropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by\r\ntheir eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till\r\ntheir dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the\r\nMoorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts\r\nwere developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when\r\nwe drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord\r\nmayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\r\n\r\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up\r\nlike a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be,\r\nwaiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.\r\nAnd the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she\r\ncould whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass\r\nwhore in Jammet\xe2\x80\x99s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind,\r\nplease, telling me the right time? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the right time up a\r\ndark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for\r\nfat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game.\r\nOf course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give that\r\nsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.\r\nFine eyes she had, clear. It\xe2\x80\x99s the white of the eye brings that out not\r\nso much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting\r\nbeyond a dog\xe2\x80\x99s jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high\r\nschool drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call\r\nthat innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.\r\nNever see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_. Eyes all over them.\r\nLook under the bed for what\xe2\x80\x99s not there. Longing to get the fright of\r\ntheir lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at\r\nthe corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,\r\ntwigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that?\r\nTypist going up Roger Greene\xe2\x80\x99s stairs two at a time to show her\r\nunderstandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.\r\nBred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the\r\nmirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\non a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly\xe2\x80\x99s Paisley shawl to\r\nPrescott\xe2\x80\x99s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her\r\nstocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries\r\nparcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand,\r\nshaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you\r\nlearn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\nknow! Three years old she was in front of Molly\xe2\x80\x99s dressingtable, just\r\nbefore we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who\r\nknows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway\r\nnot like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are.\r\nSwell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.\r\nNot like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in\r\nGrafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\r\n\r\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads\r\nand zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see\r\nand Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the\r\nrocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion.\r\nDarling, I saw, your. I saw all.\r\n\r\nLord!\r\n\r\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s, Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s. For\r\nthis relief much thanks. In _Hamlet,_ that is. Lord! It was all things\r\ncombined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of\r\nmy tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He\xe2\x80\x99s right. Might have made a\r\nworse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I\r\nwill tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however\r\nlike my name and the address Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s barn a blind.\r\n\r\n     Her maiden name was Jemina Brown\r\n     And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\r\n\r\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.\r\nWiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if\r\nit understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw\r\nanything straight at school. Crooked as a ram\xe2\x80\x99s horn. Sad however\r\nbecause it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping\r\nand papa\xe2\x80\x99s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller\xe2\x80\x99s earth for the baby\r\nwhen they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them\r\nout of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.\r\nChildren\xe2\x80\x99s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even\r\nclosed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.\r\nOughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up\r\nwith wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is\r\nnurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly\r\nwas in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O\xe2\x80\x99Hare I noticed her\r\nbrushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,\r\nmarriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City\r\nArms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.\r\nHave that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in\r\nthe morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the\r\nhusband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like\r\nglue. Maybe the women\xe2\x80\x99s fault also. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Molly can knock spots\r\noff them. It\xe2\x80\x99s the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the\r\nfigure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those\r\nothers. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to\r\nintroduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call her. Always see a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s weak point in his\r\nwife. Still there\xe2\x80\x99s destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own\r\nsecrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a\r\nshilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched\r\nthem. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one.\r\nOr old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent\r\nin December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is\r\nnot back. Better detach.\r\n\r\nOw!\r\n\r\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the\r\nshort of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.\r\nWristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic\r\ninfluence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I\r\nsuppose, at once. Cat\xe2\x80\x99s away, the mice will play. I remember looking in\r\nPill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.\r\nEarth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.\r\nAnd time, well that\xe2\x80\x99s the time the movement takes. Then if one thing\r\nstopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\narranged. Magnetic needle tells you what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the sun, the\r\nstars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.\r\nCome. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up\r\nand look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look\r\nand if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\r\n\r\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third\r\nperson. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw\r\nstuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at\r\nthe horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine\r\nvoice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like\r\nflowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the\r\npaint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her\r\nslipper on the floor so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. But lots of them can\xe2\x80\x99t kick\r\nthe beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all\r\nround over me and half down my back.\r\n\r\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave\r\nyou this to think of me when I\xe2\x80\x99m far away on the pillow. What is it?\r\nHeliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She\xe2\x80\x99d like scent of that\r\nkind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,\r\nwith a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the\r\ndance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She\r\nwas wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good\r\nconductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s some connection.\r\nFor instance if you go into a cellar where it\xe2\x80\x99s dark. Mysterious thing\r\ntoo. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,\r\nslow but sure. Suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown\r\nacross. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this\r\nmorning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a fine\r\nfine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you\r\ncall it gossamer, and they\xe2\x80\x99re always spinning it out of them, fine as\r\nanything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything\r\nshe takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little\r\nkick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff\r\nin her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.\r\nReminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There\r\nor the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes\r\nand corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.\r\nMuskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years.\r\nDogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm.\r\nHm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that\r\nway. We\xe2\x80\x99re the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have\r\ntheir period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.\r\nLike what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long\r\nJohn had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink\r\ngives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because\r\npriests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like\r\nflies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The\r\ntree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to.\r\nThat diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life.\r\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.\r\nAlmonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that\xe2\x80\x99s the soap.\r\n\r\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never\r\nwent back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag\r\nthis morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could\r\nmention Meagher\xe2\x80\x99s just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.\r\nTwo and nine. Bad opinion of me he\xe2\x80\x99ll have. Call tomorrow. How much do\r\nI owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving\r\ncredit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run\r\nup a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into\r\nsomewhere else.\r\n\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as\r\nfar as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had\r\na good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper\r\nwalk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government\r\nsit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.\r\nStill you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as\r\nwomen don\xe2\x80\x99t mock what matter? That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to find out. Ask yourself\r\nwho is he now. _The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr\r\nLeopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that\r\nfellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his\r\nkismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain\r\nthey say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body\r\nfeels the atmosphere. Old Betty\xe2\x80\x99s joints are on the rack. Mother\r\nShipton\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the\r\ntwinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills\r\nseem coming nigh.\r\n\r\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or\r\nthey might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of\r\nthe dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds\r\nflash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt\r\nyou. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through\r\nthe small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.\r\nScowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in\r\nthe shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest.\r\nRoygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,\r\nviolet. A star I see. Venus? Can\xe2\x80\x99t tell yet. Two. When three it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnight. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom\r\nship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of\r\nthe setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native\r\nland, goodnight.\r\n\r\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white\r\nfluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his\r\nway up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,\r\nsore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the\r\nposition. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green\r\napples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s the only time we cross\r\nlegs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy\r\nchairs under them. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the evening influence. They feel all that.\r\nOpen like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes,\r\nin ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat\r\nDillon\xe2\x80\x99s garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length\r\noilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.\r\nHistory repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I\xe2\x80\x99m with you once again.\r\nLife, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her\r\nlame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.\r\nThey take advantage.\r\n\r\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The\r\nrhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the\r\nplumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. Lovers: yum yum.\r\n\r\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of\r\nme, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it\r\ncomes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the\r\nsame. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing\r\nnew under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn. Are you not happy in\r\nyour? Naughty darling. At Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s barn charades in Luke Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy,\r\nLouy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the\r\nold major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I\r\nan only child. So it returns. Think you\xe2\x80\x99re escaping and run into\r\nyourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he\r\nand she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip:\r\ntear in Henny Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle:\r\ncockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She\r\nleaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in\r\nSleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty\r\nfrom the dew.\r\n\r\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ntree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you\r\ncould be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he\r\ngoes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very\r\nlikely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him\r\nout, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray\r\nfor us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition.\r\nSame thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nlight in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the\r\nmistake in the valuation when I was in Thom\xe2\x80\x99s. Twentyeight it is. Two\r\nhouses they have. Gabriel Conroy\xe2\x80\x99s brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder\r\nwhy they come out at night like mice. They\xe2\x80\x99re a mixed breed. Birds are\r\nlike hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit\r\nstill. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of\r\na jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with\r\ntiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey\r\nwhite. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example\r\nlike the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants\r\nto stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning\r\non the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with\r\nthree colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the\r\n_City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different\r\ncolours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That\xe2\x80\x99s how that\r\nwise man what\xe2\x80\x99s his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes\r\non fire. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be tourists\xe2\x80\x99 matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry\r\nrub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act\r\nas a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nso bad.\r\n\r\nBa. Who knows what they\xe2\x80\x99re always flying for. Insects? That bee last\r\nweek got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be\r\nthe one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what\r\nthey say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they\r\nhave to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms,\r\ntelegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of\r\noceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like\r\nseacows. _Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in\r\nvessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake\r\nwhen the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at\r\nthe ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it\xe2\x80\x99s round.\r\nWife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till\r\nJohnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail\r\nend of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well.\r\nAnd the tephilim no what\xe2\x80\x99s this they call it poor papa\xe2\x80\x99s father had on\r\nhis door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into\r\nthe house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when\r\nyou go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of\r\na beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish\r\never get seasick?\r\n\r\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,\r\ncrew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones\xe2\x80\x99 locker, moon looking down so\r\npeaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\r\n\r\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of\r\nfunds for Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of\r\nviolet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to\r\nhouse, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\npostman, the glowworm\xe2\x80\x99s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there\r\nthrough the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted\r\nlintstock lit the lamp at Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s terrace. By screens of lighted\r\nwindows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening\r\nTelegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from\r\nthe door of Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat\r\nflew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept,\r\ngrey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum\r\nrhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift,\r\nruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep\r\nand slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the\r\nanchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\r\n\r\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish\r\nLights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and\r\nbreeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in\r\nthe Erin\xe2\x80\x99s King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the\r\nzoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking\r\noverboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in\r\ntheir faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean.\r\nBut being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with\r\nmasks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll murder you.\r\nIs it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can\r\npeople aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only\r\ntroubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that.\r\nAfter getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What\r\ndo they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with\r\nthe umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking.\r\nLittle hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when\r\nyou touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I\r\nremember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is\r\nmore sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves\r\nout if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening\r\nme. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child!\r\nStrange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar.\r\nLooking from Buena Vista. O\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old\r\nBarbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men\r\nto cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like\r\nthis, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I\xe2\x80\x99d marry a lord or a rich\r\ngentleman coming with a private yacht. _Buenas noches, se\xc3\xb1orita. El\r\nhombre ama la muchacha hermosa_. Why me? Because you were so foreign\r\nfrom the others.\r\n\r\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you\r\ndull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for\r\n_Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital\r\nto see. Hope she\xe2\x80\x99s over. Long day I\xe2\x80\x99ve had. Martha, the bath, funeral,\r\nhouse of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 song. Then that\r\nbawler in Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what\r\nI said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought\r\nto go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in\r\ncompany. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me.\r\nLook at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he\r\nmeant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he\r\nhawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty.\r\nParticularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of\r\nthe wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early\r\nmorning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he\r\nkissed the cow. But Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so\r\ndepressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must\r\ncall to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for\r\ngranted we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it\r\noutside Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but\r\nprogressing favourably on the premium. Her widow\xe2\x80\x99s mite. Well? What do\r\nyou expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to\r\nsee. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O\xe2\x80\x99Connor wife and five children\r\npoisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly\r\nwoman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and\r\na large apron. Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a\r\npair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.\r\nUgly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we\r\ndie. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the\r\ntrick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed.\r\nCurse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She\r\nhad red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does?\r\nWould I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\r\nMailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes\xe2\x80\x99s. Work\r\nHynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in\r\nthem. What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Might be money.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He\r\nbrought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can\xe2\x80\x99t read. Better go.\r\nBetter. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and\r\npebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with\r\nstory of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children\r\nalways want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the\r\nwaters. What\xe2\x80\x99s this? Bit of stick.\r\n\r\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here\r\ntomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers\r\ndo. Will I?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write\r\na message for her. Might remain. What?\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nSome flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide\r\ncomes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark\r\nmirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and\r\nletters. O, those transparent! Besides they don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What is the\r\nmeaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nAM. A.\r\n\r\nNo room. Let it go.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.\r\nNothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.\r\nExcept Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nHe flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now\r\nif you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Chance.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made\r\nme feel so young.\r\n\r\nShort snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.\r\nNot even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a\r\nmoment. Won\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat\r\nagain. No harm in him. Just a few.\r\n\r\nO sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me\r\ndo love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed\r\nmet him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair\r\nheave under embon _se\xc3\xb1orita_ young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan\r\nWinkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail\r\nend Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return\r\nnext in her next her next.\r\n\r\nA bat flew.

Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne\r\nholding wariest ward.\r\n\r\nIn ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising\r\nwith swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping\r\nlightens in eyeblink Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s westward welkin. Full she drad that God\r\nthe Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe\r\ninfare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in\r\nHorne\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nLoth to irk in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow\r\nhe ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over\r\nland and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in\r\ntownhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he\r\ncraved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face,\r\nhers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of\r\nblushes his word winning.\r\n\r\nAs her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad\r\nafter she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O\xe2\x80\x99Hare Doctor\r\ntidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered\r\nthat O\xe2\x80\x99Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear\r\nthat him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing\r\ndeath for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God\xe2\x80\x99s rightwiseness to\r\nwithsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His\r\ngoodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men\xe2\x80\x99s oil\r\nto his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death\r\nthe dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was\r\ndied in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas\r\nand she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his\r\nundeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So\r\nstood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.\r\n\r\nTherefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the\r\ndust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came\r\nnaked forth from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb so naked shall he wend him at the\r\nlast for to go as he came.\r\n\r\nThe man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman\r\nand he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in\r\nchildbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in\r\nthroes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to\r\nbear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she\r\nhad seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew\r\nthe man that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to\r\nher words for he felt with wonder women\xe2\x80\x99s woe in the travail that they\r\nhave of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair\r\nface for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a\r\nhandmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.\r\n\r\nAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there\r\nnighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there\r\ncame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept\r\nDixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed\r\nthat they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where\r\nthis learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be\r\nhealed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a\r\nhorrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a\r\nsalve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he\r\nsaid now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with\r\nthem that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go\r\notherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady\r\nwas of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well\r\nthat the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But\r\nthe learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have\r\nhim in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a\r\nmarvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for\r\nto rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches\r\nenvironing in divers lands and sometime venery.\r\n\r\nAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy\r\nand it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not\r\nmove more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and\r\nknives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white\r\nflames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there\r\nabound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic\r\nof Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that\r\nhe blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was\r\non the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there\r\nwas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay\r\nstrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be\r\npossible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these\r\nfishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of\r\nthe fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And\r\nalso it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a\r\ncompost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of\r\ncertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like\r\nto a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine\r\nthemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of\r\nthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.\r\n\r\nAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp\r\nthereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe\r\nLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat\r\nin amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and\r\nanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and\r\nhis neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle\r\nwith them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at\r\nthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing\r\nfor there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time\r\nhied fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered\r\nwhat cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,\r\nthat it be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware\r\nand saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was\r\nolder than any of the tother and for that they both were knights\r\nvirtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke\r\nto him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring\r\nforth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath\r\nwaited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said,\r\nExpecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood\r\ntofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to\r\ndrink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far\r\nas he might to their both\xe2\x80\x99s health for he was a passing good man of his\r\nlustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat\r\nin scholars\xe2\x80\x99 hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that\r\never laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight\r\nof the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged\r\nhim courtly in the cup. Woman\xe2\x80\x99s woe with wonder pondering.\r\n\r\nNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be\r\ndrunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side\r\nthe board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary\r\nMerciable\xe2\x80\x99s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of\r\nmedicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,\r\none Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at\r\nhead of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long\r\nof a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young\r\nStephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and\r\nbeside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that\r\nhe promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how\r\nhe had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast\r\nfriendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that\r\nhis languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as\r\nthey feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red\r\nhim, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.\r\n\r\nFor they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each\r\ngen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining\r\nthat put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen\r\nout a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nthat now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next\r\nbefore her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her\r\ncase). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,\r\nthey said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that\r\nwere of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for\r\nhe had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young\r\nLynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it\r\nwas never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the\r\nlaw nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was\r\nscant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,\r\nthe wife should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed\r\nhot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but\r\nthe franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at\r\nthe least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the\r\nwhole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion\r\nsake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint\r\nUltan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby\r\nthey were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words\r\nfollowing: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and\r\nparent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in\r\npurgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we\r\nnightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very\r\nGod, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We\r\nare means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends\r\nthan we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.\r\nBut he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was\r\nthat he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or\r\nleman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.\r\nWhereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi\xe2\x80\x99s praise of that\r\nbeast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the\r\nother all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they\r\ndid malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his\r\nengines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to\r\ndo. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir\r\nLeopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour\r\nwhich he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare\r\nwhoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of\r\nmother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,\r\nof Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of\r\nbrightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius\r\nsaith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or\r\nan she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu\r\nsecuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of\r\nAverroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the\r\nsecond month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother\r\nfoldeth ever souls for God\xe2\x80\x99s greater glory whereas that earthly mother\r\nwhich was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he\r\nthat holdeth the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s seal, even that blessed Peter on which\r\nrock was holy church for all ages founded. All they bachelors then\r\nasked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as\r\nrisk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted\r\nall and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that\r\nas it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a\r\nlayman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an\r\naccident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had\r\nbirth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their\r\nquestions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant\r\nword. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he\r\naverred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he\r\nwas of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that\r\ntaking it appeared eftsoons.\r\n\r\nBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had\r\npity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and\r\nas he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only\r\nmanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art\r\ncould save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart\r\nfor that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of\r\nlamb\xe2\x80\x99s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and\r\nlie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir\r\nLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness\r\nand as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for\r\nall accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure\r\nfor young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and\r\nmurdered his goods with whores.\r\n\r\nAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty\r\nso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed\r\ntheir approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying\r\nfor the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge\r\nthe vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink\r\nwe, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed\r\nparcel of my body but my soul\xe2\x80\x99s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to\r\nthem that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for\r\nthis will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he\r\nshowed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the\r\nworth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song\r\nwhich he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such\r\ndearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as\r\nfolloweth: Know all men, he said, time\xe2\x80\x99s ruins build eternity\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmansions. What means this? Desire\xe2\x80\x99s wind blasts the thorntree but after\r\nit becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark\r\nme now. In woman\xe2\x80\x99s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the\r\nmaker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.\r\nThis is the postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but\r\nher name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,\r\nHealer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and\r\nBernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae\r\nsupplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is\r\nthe second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,\r\nour grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of\r\nnavelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.\r\nBut here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was\r\nbut creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or\r\nshe knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy\r\nwith Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with\r\nJoseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,\r\n_parceque M. L\xc3\xa9o Taxil nous a dit que qui l\xe2\x80\x99avait mise dans cette\r\nfichue position c\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tait le sacr\xc3\xa9 pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_\r\ntransubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case\r\nsubsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A\r\npregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without\r\nblemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour\r\nworship. With will will we withstand, withsay.\r\n\r\nHereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would\r\nsing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod\r\nof a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:\r\n_The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse\r\nQuigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was\r\nit not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all\r\norderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no\r\ngasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an\r\nancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in\r\nhabit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her\r\nhortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of\r\nthem all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness\r\nsome and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all\r\nchode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,\r\nthou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou\r\nchitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,\r\nto shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the\r\ngood sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,\r\nmargerain gentle, advising also the time\xe2\x80\x99s occasion as most sacred and\r\nmost worthy to be most sacred. In Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house rest should reign.\r\n\r\nTo be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in\r\nEccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he\r\nhad not cided to take friar\xe2\x80\x99s vows and he answered him obedience in the\r\nwomb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master\r\nLenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds\r\nand how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue\r\nof a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all\r\nintershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he\r\nsaid very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was\r\nthe eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more\r\nand they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing\r\nand deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,\r\nshe to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,\r\nwith burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries\r\nand the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was\r\nthere unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those\r\ndelicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is\r\nin their _Maid\xe2\x80\x99s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:\r\n_To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable\r\nconcent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most\r\nmollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous\r\nflambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium\r\nof connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,\r\nbut, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher\r\nfor, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen\r\nsaid indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between\r\nthem and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for\r\nlife ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved\r\nwith it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay\r\ndown his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words\r\nto that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French\r\nletters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to\r\nwhom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it\r\nwill go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres,\r\npro memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy\r\ngenerations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by\r\nmy word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication\r\nin my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou\r\nsinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of\r\nservants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why\r\nhast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for\r\na merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian\r\nof dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth\r\nnow, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo\r\nand from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with\r\nmilk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon\r\nand my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for\r\never in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast\r\nthou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to\r\nsay, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much\r\nas mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell\xe2\x80\x99s gates\r\nvisited a darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates\r\natrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father\r\nshoweth the prince no blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon\r\nof life is an Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s plague which in the nights of prenativity and\r\npostmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends\r\nand ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their\r\ninceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads\r\nforth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis\r\nthat minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto\r\nnature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into\r\nlife: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over\r\nus dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among\r\nbulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a\r\nmountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat\r\nand the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor\r\nto what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or\r\nto Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see\r\nfrom what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched\r\nhis whenceness.\r\n\r\nThereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he\r\nloudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast\r\nmajestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all\r\nin applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.\r\n\r\n     Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack\r\n     See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,\r\n     In the proud cirque of Jackjohn\xe2\x80\x99s bivouac.\r\n\r\nA black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on\r\nleft Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the\r\nstorm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to\r\nflout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and\r\npaganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as\r\nthey might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before\r\nso haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart\r\nshook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that\r\nstorm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard\r\nagain to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he\r\nwas indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the\r\nbraggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was\r\nmuchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was\r\nonly to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s hall. He\r\ndrank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it\r\nthundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,\r\nbeing godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of\r\ndoom and Master Bloom, at the braggart\xe2\x80\x99s side, spoke to him calming\r\nwords to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing\r\nbut a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the\r\nthunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a\r\nnatural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nBut was young Boasthard\xe2\x80\x99s fear vanquished by Calmer\xe2\x80\x99s words? No, for he\r\nhad in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be\r\ndone away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the\r\nother? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But\r\ncould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the\r\nbottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not\r\nthere to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the\r\ngod Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?\r\nWhy, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube\r\nUnderstanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw\r\nthat he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one\r\nday die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not\r\naccept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though\r\nhe must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives\r\nwhich Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted\r\nhe nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the\r\nland of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for\r\never where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering\r\nat which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told\r\nhim of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason\r\nwas that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing\r\nexterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him\r\nwrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,\r\nHo, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave\r\nplace, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot\r\nwhich is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal\r\nConcupiscence.\r\n\r\nThis was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of\r\nMothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore\r\nBird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a\r\nwicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and\r\nknow her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but\r\nnotion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,\r\nTwo-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and\r\nin it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words\r\nprinted on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by\r\nJowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they\r\ncared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of\r\noxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring\r\nthat was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was\r\nnamed Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr\r\nSometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,\r\nYoung Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company,\r\nwere ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a\r\nvery grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill\r\ntheir souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them\r\ncontrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.\r\n\r\nSo Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and\r\nafter hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a\r\nfifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won\xe2\x80\x99t sprout, fields\r\nathirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.\r\nHard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without\r\nsprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The\r\nrosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought\r\nbut dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world\r\nsaying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that\r\ndid havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.\r\nBut by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in\r\nthe west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and\r\nthe weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first\r\nand after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder\r\nand in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the\r\nsmoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or\r\nkerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the\r\npour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke\xe2\x80\x99s lawn, thence through\r\nMerrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was\r\nbefore bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no\r\nmore crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice\r\nFitzgibbon\xe2\x80\x99s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the\r\ncollege lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s gentleman that had but come\r\nfrom Mr Moore\xe2\x80\x99s the writer\xe2\x80\x99s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a\r\ngood Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are\r\nnow in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from\r\nMullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M\xe2\x80\x99s brother will stay a\r\nmonth yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,\r\nhe bound home and he to Andrew Horne\xe2\x80\x99s being stayed for to crush a cup\r\nof wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of\r\nher age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and\r\nso both together on to Horne\xe2\x80\x99s. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s journal\r\nsitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon\r\njun., scholar of my lady of Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will.\r\nMadden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.\r\nLeop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having\r\ndreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers\r\non in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be\r\nfor a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading\r\nher belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,\r\nthe midwives sore put to it and can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of\r\nriceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very\r\nheavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they\r\nsay, but God give her soon issue. \xe2\x80\x99Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,\r\nand Lady day bit off her last chick\xe2\x80\x99s nails that was then a twelvemonth\r\nand with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand\r\nin the king\xe2\x80\x99s bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the\r\nsacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys\r\noff Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in\r\na punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag,\r\nI hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and\r\nwill much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and\r\nwater fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi\xe2\x80\x99s almanac (and I\r\nhear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out\r\nof the Hindustanish for his farmer\xe2\x80\x99s gazette) to have three things in\r\nall but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and\r\nbairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their\r\nqueerities no telling how.\r\n\r\nWith this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the\r\nletter was in that night\xe2\x80\x99s gazette and he made a show to find it about\r\nhim (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but\r\non Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit\r\nnear by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman\r\nthat went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of\r\nwomen, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he\r\nwas mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the\r\ncoffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s men,\r\nrunners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues\r\nof the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at\r\nnights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much\r\nloose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook\xe2\x80\x99s and if he had but\r\ngotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a\r\nbare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his\r\ntongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that\r\nis, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he\r\nsays, Frank (that was his name), \xe2\x80\x99tis all about Kerry cows that are to\r\nbe butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a\r\nwink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There\xe2\x80\x99s as good fish\r\nin this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take\r\nof some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the\r\nmeantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his\r\nembassy as he was sharpset. _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the\r\nFrench language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a\r\nwinelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a\r\nchild this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,\r\nwho could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of\r\nthe globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but\r\nhe took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar\r\nwith the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One\r\ntime he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought\r\nwould keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for\r\nthe ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,\r\nkidnapping a squire\xe2\x80\x99s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlinen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times\r\nas a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to\r\nhis father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw\r\nhim. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to\r\nknow the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but\r\nthis day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce\r\nbelieve \xe2\x80\x99tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood\r\nbeasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been\r\nsome years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster\r\nthat drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr\r\nGavin Low\xe2\x80\x99s yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he.\r\nMore like \xe2\x80\x99tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little\r\nmoved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had\r\ndispatches from the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s chief tailtickler thanking him for the\r\nhospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted\r\ncowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the\r\nbull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nIrish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and\r\nhe sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I\r\nconceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our\r\nisland by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with\r\nan emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the\r\ntable, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a\r\nportlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a\r\ncoat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his\r\nnostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\r\nrollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\r\nWhat for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas\r\nthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\r\nwere no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my\r\ncousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s blessing,\r\nand with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and\r\nthe blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he\r\ntaught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess\r\nand widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the\r\nmonth whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the\r\nnape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young\r\nravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his\r\nword: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat\r\nwith a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his\r\nforelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables\r\nfor him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of\r\nthe best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they\r\ncalled him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To\r\nremedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in\r\ntheir apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on\r\nhis hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow\r\nout of him in bulls\xe2\x80\x99 language and they all after him. Ay, says another,\r\nand so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the\r\nland but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his\r\nmind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the\r\nisland with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the\r\ngrass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got\r\nscent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a\r\nhusbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or\r\na bag of rapeseed out he\xe2\x80\x99d run amok over half the countryside rooting\r\nup with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\r\nThere was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the\r\nlord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an\r\nold whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I\xe2\x80\x99ll meddle in\r\nhis matters, says he. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with\r\nthe help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says\r\nMr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to\r\ndinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the\r\nfirst rule of the course was that the others were to row with\r\npitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and\r\non picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he\r\nfound sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous\r\nchampion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for\r\nboss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his\r\nhead into a cow\xe2\x80\x99s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers\r\nand pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the\r\nwater running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had\r\nbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls\xe2\x80\x99 language\r\nto study but he could never learn a word of it except the first\r\npersonal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if\r\never he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write\r\nit upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or\r\na bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland\r\nwere soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr\r\nStephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was\r\ntoward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,\r\nloaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all\r\nmasts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread\r\nthree sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed\r\nanchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times\r\nthree, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea\r\nto recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr\r\nVincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Pope Peter\xe2\x80\x99s but a pissabed.\r\n\r\nA man\xe2\x80\x99s a man for a\xe2\x80\x99 that._\r\n\r\nOur worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway\r\nas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend\r\nwhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,\r\nwho had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a\r\ncornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil\r\nenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a\r\nproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched\r\non. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards\r\nwhich he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell\xe2\x80\x99s bearing a legend\r\nprinted in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and\r\nIncubator. Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was\r\nto withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief\r\nbusiness of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and\r\nto devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has\r\nbeen framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I\r\nmake no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. \xe2\x80\x99Tis as\r\ncheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,\r\nexpatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into\r\nthis thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the\r\ninhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were\r\ndue to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as\r\nwhether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from\r\nproclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the\r\nnuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so\r\nmany agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest\r\nbonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial\r\ncloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some\r\nunaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,\r\nsacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty\r\nfellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart\r\nweep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a\r\nsuppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of\r\nworth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in\r\nfee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord\r\nTalbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our\r\nascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising\r\nfarm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the\r\nfashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the\r\nfecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there\r\ndirect to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her\r\nnatural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for\r\nhis pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of\r\nfashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm\r\npersuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his\r\nnutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet\r\nof savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these\r\nlatter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both\r\nbroiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum\r\nchillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of\r\nasseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief\r\nwith which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken\r\nby the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as\r\nmight be observed by Mr Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s smallclothes of a hodden grey which\r\nwas now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably\r\nentertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr\r\nDixon of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he\r\npurpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made\r\ncourt to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as\r\nit dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of\r\nhis contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut\r\nmatresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici\r\ntitillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus\r\ncenturionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder\r\nwit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more\r\nsuitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the\r\nfarmyard drake and duck.\r\n\r\nValuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper\r\nman of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with\r\nanimadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics\r\nwhile the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had\r\nadvanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a\r\npassage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his\r\nnearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for\r\nwhom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him\r\na civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional\r\nassistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very\r\nheartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he\r\nwas come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house, that was\r\nin an interesting condition, poor body, from woman\xe2\x80\x99s woe (and here he\r\nfetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr\r\nDixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether\r\nhis incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an\r\novoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,\r\nas with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the\r\nstomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,\r\nsmote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable\r\ndroll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex\r\nthough \xe2\x80\x99tis pity she\xe2\x80\x99s a trollop): There\xe2\x80\x99s a belly that never bore a\r\nbastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth\r\nand threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.\r\nThe spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some\r\nlarum in the antechamber.\r\n\r\nHere the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little\r\nfume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion\r\nwith the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient\r\npoint, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the\r\nobligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by\r\na questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had\r\nnot achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but\r\ncontrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was\r\never done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien\r\ns\xc3\xbbr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That\r\nyou may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to\r\ncrown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in\r\nmy wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept\r\nof them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give\r\nthanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver\r\nof good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,\r\ntook a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening\r\nhis bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very\r\npicture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.\r\nGazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he\r\nsaid, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting\r\ninstant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her\r\nfeastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so\r\nmelting a tenderness, \xe2\x80\x99pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been\r\nimpelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands\r\nof such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never\r\nso touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!\r\nThrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her\r\nfavours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having\r\nreplaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.\r\nBeneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great\r\nand universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in\r\nthrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished\r\ncoxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of\r\nmaturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled\r\nand imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in\r\nanguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my\r\ncloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured\r\nseven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,\r\nhe cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day\r\nand, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur\r\nPoyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the\r\nFrench fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le\r\nF\xc3\xa9condateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most\r\naccomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in\r\na circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape\r\nHorn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even\r\nthe stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans\r\nblague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest\r\nposthaste to another world. Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The\r\nclumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a\r\nfairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would\r\nwear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge\r\nbefore ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she\r\nreminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there\r\nwas none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the\r\ndivine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a\r\nhousehold word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our\r\noriginal garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is\r\nthe fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my\r\npretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my\r\nattention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),\r\nthe first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall\r\ncut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of\r\nour store of knowledge.\r\n\r\nAmid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while\r\nall were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,\r\nhaving spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with\r\na profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a\r\nparty of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and\r\nnot less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of\r\nthe most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of\r\nribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.\r\nA monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sworn she has rendezvoused\r\nyou. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad\xe2\x80\x99s bud, immensely so,\r\nsaid Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater\r\nhospice. Demme, does not Doctor O\xe2\x80\x99Gargle chuck the nuns there under the\r\nchin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been\r\nwardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried\r\nthe young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and\r\nwith immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the\r\nman! Bless me, I\xe2\x80\x99m all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you\xe2\x80\x99re as bad as dear\r\nlittle Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half\r\nchoke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young\r\nsurgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as\r\nthe nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.\r\nMerciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings\r\nof the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable\r\nfortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience,\r\nsaid he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to\r\ninstruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence\r\ndue to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I\r\nam positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of\r\nwitnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far\r\nfrom being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human\r\nbreast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable\r\nMiss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of\r\nours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child\r\nof clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race\r\nwhere the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right\r\nreverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having\r\ndelivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and\r\nrepaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were\r\nfor ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have\r\nbeen effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had\r\nhe not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid\r\nimprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of\r\nthe true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was\r\nalways the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most\r\nparticular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand\r\nto a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks\r\nback on with a loving heart.\r\n\r\nTo revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of\r\nsome impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits\r\nof that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.\r\nThe young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as\r\novergrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were\r\ndifficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and\r\noutrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were\r\nthey scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of\r\nstrong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr\r\nCostello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch\r\nthat seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born\r\nout of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into\r\nthe world, which the dint of the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s pliers in his skull lent\r\nindeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of\r\ncreation\xe2\x80\x99s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was\r\nnow for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had\r\npassed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a\r\nwary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his\r\nheart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting\r\nthem with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that\r\nplenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn\r\nand all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create\r\nthemselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which\r\nhe never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the\r\nname nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such\r\nthat, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the\r\nsharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a\r\nprecipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with\r\nmettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the\r\ngruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy\r\nWriter expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far\r\nforth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a\r\ngentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while\r\nfrom the sister\xe2\x80\x99s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,\r\nhowever, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence\r\nthat the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now\r\ntestified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the\r\nSupreme Being.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express\r\nhis notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to\r\nexpress one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid\r\ngenius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her\r\nconfinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.\r\nThe dressy young blade said it was her husband\xe2\x80\x99s that put her in that\r\nexpectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian\r\nmatron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table\r\nso as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum\r\nwas round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring\r\nthrough his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he\r\ncalls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event\r\nwould burst anon. \xe2\x80\x99Slife, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be round with you. I cannot but extol\r\nthe virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another\r\nchild out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own\r\nfashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that\r\nanother than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in\r\norders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed\r\nin every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the\r\nwonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that\r\nthe puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the\r\nseminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic\r\ntitles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of\r\nlevity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise\r\neminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap\r\nto relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have\r\nmore than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.\r\n\r\nBut with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,\r\nhas this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted\r\nto civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal\r\npolity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have\r\ncounselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary\r\nadvantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that\r\nmoment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a\r\ntenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per\r\ncents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is\r\nit that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own\r\ndupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?\r\nFar be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,\r\nthe daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant\r\nreflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it\r\nwas indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy\r\nwoman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate\r\nprerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than\r\nthe derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very\r\npelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of\r\nnature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn\r\nfrom the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy\xe2\x80\x99s scouringbrush\r\nnot been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with\r\nHagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish\r\nasperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe\xe2\x80\x99s hearing brought upon him from\r\nan indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as\r\nstraightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that\r\ngospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the\r\nwant of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second\r\nnature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm\r\nof Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to\r\nhealth a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist\r\nbetter with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is\r\nthe repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The\r\nlewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort\r\nneglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of\r\nills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native\r\norient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,\r\ntransplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their\r\nquondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,\r\nacid and inoperative.\r\n\r\nThe news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial\r\nusage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the\r\njunior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the\r\ndelegation that an heir had been born. When he had betaken himself to\r\nthe women\xe2\x80\x99s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the\r\nafterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic\r\naffairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous\r\nexhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and\r\nsolemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would\r\npalliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and\r\nobstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of\r\ntongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring\r\nto urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the\r\ndisplay of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union\r\namong tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was\r\nsuccessively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,\r\nthe Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that\r\nrarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as\r\nthe Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr\r\nAdvocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,\r\nthe rights of primogeniture and king\xe2\x80\x99s bounty touching twins and\r\ntriplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the\r\nacardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the\r\nagnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)\r\nin consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the\r\nmedial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other\r\nspoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation\r\nof labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the\r\nvein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in\r\nthe actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,\r\nartificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb\r\nconsequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the\r\nspecies in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that\r\ndistressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers\r\n_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and\r\nmonstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of\r\nconsanguineous parents\xe2\x80\x94in a word all the cases of human nativity which\r\nAristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic\r\nillustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine\r\nwere examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the\r\nstate of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step\r\nover a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should\r\nstrangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a\r\nyearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand\r\nagainst that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the\r\nseat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,\r\nsupernumerary digits, negro\xe2\x80\x99s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain\r\nwere alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical\r\nexplanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens\r\nwas not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The\r\nhypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and\r\nworthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,\r\nenvisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some\r\nstage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against\r\nboth these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the\r\ntheory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his\r\nauthority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of\r\nthe Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down\r\nto us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his\r\nwords was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had\r\nbeen evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of\r\npleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as\r\nthe supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously,\r\na heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr\r\nCandidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created\r\nin the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty\r\nby mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant\r\nsubmittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the\r\nbetter to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the\r\ngarb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he\r\ndelivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the\r\necclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has\r\njoined.\r\n\r\nBut Malachias\xe2\x80\x99 tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up\r\nthe scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back\r\nand in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his\r\nflesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,\r\nin the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were\r\ndepicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I\r\nanticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for\r\nwhich, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the\r\nmurderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no\r\nterrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what\r\nway would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping\r\nDublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the\r\nlike of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s, is in this\r\nlife. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions,\r\nrookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised\r\nthe phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me.\r\nDope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry\r\nhe suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head\r\nappeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station\r\nat ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the\r\ndissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The\r\nvendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The\r\nsentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense\r\ndebtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.\r\nThe mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name\r\nwas Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.\r\nHe drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely\r\nhouse by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The\r\nspider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from\r\nhis hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer\xe2\x80\x99s ground.\r\n\r\nWhat is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the\r\nchameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the\r\nmerry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as\r\nher mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing\r\nthe cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a\r\nmodest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is\r\nyoung Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror\r\nwithin a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure\r\nof then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from\r\nthe old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel\r\non him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in\r\nhis first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a\r\nfullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,\r\na scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright\r\ntrinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of\r\ncompliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out\r\nupon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but\r\nthe heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but,\r\nmore than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at\r\nduskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you\r\nmay be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some\r\npaper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is\r\nbreathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a\r\ntiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about\r\nhim might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own\r\nchild. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the\r\nbonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child\r\nof shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her\r\nluckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two\r\nraincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly!\r\nHe will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night,\r\nthe bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer\r\nwith the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the\r\nworld. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\ndone but\xe2\x80\x94hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away\r\nthrough the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.\r\nShe dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and\r\nmemory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was\r\ntaken from thee\xe2\x80\x94and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is\r\nnone now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.\r\n\r\nThe voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the\r\ninfinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over\r\nregions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey\r\ntwilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,\r\nshedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her\r\nmother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight\r\nphantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim\r\nshapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.\r\nThey fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home\r\nof screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more.\r\nAnd on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of\r\nrebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks\r\nbehind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are\r\nscorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and\r\nmastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous\r\nrevengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned\r\nand capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the\r\ngiantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all\r\ntheir moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.\r\n\r\nOnward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible\r\ngulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine\r\nportent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo,\r\nwonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger\r\nof the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost\r\none, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she\r\nnow arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan\r\nhour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you\r\ncall it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and\r\nloose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on\r\ncurrents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply\r\nswirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a\r\nmyriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled\r\nsign upon the forehead of Taurus.\r\n\r\nFrancis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at\r\nschool together in Conmee\xe2\x80\x99s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,\r\nPisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the\r\npast and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them\r\ninto life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to\r\nmy call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending\r\nbard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair\r\nwith a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those\r\nleaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something\r\nmore, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your\r\ngenius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to\r\nsee you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you\r\nStephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent\r\nLenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He\r\ncould not leave his mother an orphan. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s face grew dark.\r\nAll could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and\r\nof his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the\r\nnoise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on\r\nSceptre for a whim of the rider\xe2\x80\x99s name: Lenehan as much more. He told\r\nthem of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran\r\nout freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts\r\nwere beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her\r\nscarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run\r\nhome when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,\r\nreached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her\r\neyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover\r\nconsoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some\r\noval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking\r\nfine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three\r\ntoday. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous\r\nbuffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it\r\nas was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said\r\nwith a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this\r\nhand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do\r\nyou remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today,\r\nVincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair\r\nbeside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the\r\nright name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air\r\ndrooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In\r\nthe sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of\r\nthose buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his\r\nbooth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm\r\nwith which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I\r\npressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but\r\ntoday she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then.\r\nHer posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we\r\nreclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who\r\nmet us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the\r\nhedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty\r\nletter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature\r\nturned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight\r\ndisorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very\r\ntrees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo\r\nin that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he\r\nhad blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor\r\nluck with Bass\xe2\x80\x99s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more\r\npropensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and\r\nwithheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.\r\nWarily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far\r\naway. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be\r\nborn. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the\r\nincorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos\r\ntold me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian\r\npriests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the\r\nmoon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of\r\nthe lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were\r\ntherefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him\r\nbeing in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which\r\nwas entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was\r\nnot the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above\r\nwas going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of\r\nanimation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody\r\nthat conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty\r\nspeedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts\r\nhe had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled\r\nby Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated\r\namongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was\r\ncertainly calculated to attract anyone\xe2\x80\x99s remark on account of its\r\nscarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently\r\ntranspired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an\r\naltogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x99s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two\r\nor three private transactions of his own which the other two were as\r\nmutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both\r\ntheir eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other\r\nwas endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily\r\ndetermined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the\r\nneck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid\r\nsought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out\r\nwith, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of\r\nattentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it\r\nabout the place.\r\n\r\nThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the\r\ncourse of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The\r\ndebaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on\r\nthe loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house had never\r\nbeheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old\r\nrafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so\r\nencyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at\r\nthe foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing\r\nfrom the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to\r\nhim, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early\r\ndepravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place\r\nassigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in\r\nstolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident\r\nindeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the\r\nfigure of Bannon in explorer\xe2\x80\x99s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide\r\nbrogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred\r\nmanners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the\r\nboard was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of\r\npedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of\r\nSocratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated\r\nthe flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that\r\nvigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained\r\nby the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and\r\nconstant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever\r\nefface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired\r\npencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.\r\n\r\nIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted\r\ntranscendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 (Div. Scep.) contentions\r\nwould appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter\r\nto accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often\r\nrepeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the\r\nman in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked\r\nand explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some\r\nquestions which science cannot answer\xe2\x80\x94at present\xe2\x80\x94such as the first\r\nproblem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future\r\ndetermination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of\r\nTrinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert\r\nothers) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long\r\nneglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is\r\nit, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,\r\nSpallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture\r\nof both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on\r\nthe one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus\r\nfelix_, of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same\r\ninquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting\r\nbecause, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but\r\nwe all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames\r\nthe sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract\r\nadenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk\r\nin dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles\r\noffered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers\r\nof all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic\r\ncardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors\r\nand unfructified duennas\xe2\x80\x94these, he said, were accountable for any and\r\nevery fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied,\r\nwould soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely\r\ngood music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive\r\npictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as\r\nVenus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all\r\nthese little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular\r\ncondition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr\r\nJ. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to\r\nabdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy\r\nlabours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by\r\nfar the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in\r\nthe exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or\r\nin the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are\r\nthinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of\r\nnurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too\r\nrare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder\r\nis that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,\r\nall things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which\r\noften baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that\r\nthrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and\r\nmortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal\r\nmovements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,\r\neverything, in fine, in nature\xe2\x80\x99s vast workshop from the extinction of\r\nsome remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which\r\nbeautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet\r\nunascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of\r\nnormally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly\r\nlooked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other\r\nchildren of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and\r\ncogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths\r\nare due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous\r\ngerms have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively\r\nshown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend\r\nto disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an\r\narrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings\r\n(notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long\r\nrun beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival\r\nof the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be\r\ncalled an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,\r\ndeglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with\r\npluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous\r\nfemales emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not\r\nto speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly\r\nfind gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals\r\nas nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above\r\nalluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately\r\nacquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this\r\nmorbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening\r\nbumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid\r\nfrom an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated\r\nthat staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed\r\nvictuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly\r\ndropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L.\r\nBloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons\xe2\x80\x99 hall of the\r\nNational Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as\r\nis well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the\r\nable and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having\r\nstated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nallusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of\r\nall nature\xe2\x80\x99s processes\xe2\x80\x94the act of sexual congress) she must let it out\r\nagain or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk\r\nof her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the\r\nless effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a\r\nhappy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient\r\nand doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave\r\nwoman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and\r\nnow she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone\r\nbefore, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching\r\nscene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the\r\nmotherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty\r\nsight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,\r\nbreathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal\r\nHusband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one\r\nblessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,\r\nto lay in his arms that mite of God\xe2\x80\x99s clay, the fruit of their lawful\r\nembraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle\r\nstooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity\r\nhas come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,\r\nCollege Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now,\r\nit may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old\r\nshake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now\r\nacross the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her\r\nimagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice,\r\nFrederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances),\r\nTom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our\r\nfamous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and\r\nCandahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever\r\nthere was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be\r\nchristened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr\r\nPurefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer\xe2\x80\x99s office, Dublin Castle. And so\r\ntime wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no\r\nsigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the\r\nashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the\r\ncurfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light\r\nwhereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so\r\nwith a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His\r\nown good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally\r\nyour man\xe2\x80\x99s part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful\r\nservant!\r\n\r\nThere are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil\r\nmemories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the\r\nheart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow\r\ndim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade\r\nhimself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance\r\nword will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront\r\nhim in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while\r\ntimbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility\r\nof the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with\r\nwine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies\r\nunder her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but\r\nshrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,\r\nreproachful.\r\n\r\nThe stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of\r\nthat false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied\r\ntrick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an\r\nunhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene\r\ndisengages itself in the observer\xe2\x80\x99s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a\r\nword of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present\r\nthere (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space\r\nof lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at\r\nRoundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game\r\nbut with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward\r\nover the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief\r\nalert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at\r\ntimes in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,\r\nFloey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of\r\narresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of\r\nthem pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin\r\nso daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in\r\nlinseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth\r\nwhen ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the\r\nurn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little\r\njust as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment\r\nof the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother\r\nwatches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint\r\nshadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Verg\xc3\xa4ngliche_) in her glad\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nMark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that\r\nantechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their\r\nfaces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of\r\ncustody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant\r\nwatch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long\r\nago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with\r\npreponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,\r\ncompass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched\r\nfield and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in\r\nan instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of\r\nthe thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was\r\nthe transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nBurke\xe2\x80\x99s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and\r\nbobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,\r\npunctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,\r\nashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and\r\nwhat not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse\r\nCallan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon\r\ncoming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a\r\nmilligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out,\r\ntumultuously, off for a minute\xe2\x80\x99s race, all bravely legging it, Burke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nof Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them\r\nsharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with\r\nnurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up\r\nthere. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward\r\nof watching in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house has told its tale in that washedout\r\npallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers\r\nclose in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?\r\n\r\nThe air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence\r\ncelestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s air, the Allfather\xe2\x80\x99s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.\r\nBreathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done\r\na doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest\r\nprogenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most\r\nfarraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven\r\npreformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog\r\nand let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their\r\ndaddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up!\r\nFor every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See,\r\nthy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A\r\ncanting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell\r\nthee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not\r\nworth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I!\r\nHerod\xe2\x80\x99s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables,\r\nforsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw,\r\nbleeding!

A pure mare\xe2\x80\x99s nest. I am\r\na man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable\r\nmarried man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.\r\nMy wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant\r\nupstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy,\r\none of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s fighting men who helped to win our battles.

Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.)_ My old dad too\r\nwas a J. P. I\xe2\x80\x99m as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with\r\nthe colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general\r\nGough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was\r\nmentioned in dispatches.

One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak\r\nmasquerading as a literateur. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly obvious that with the most\r\ninherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really\r\ngorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath\r\nsuspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which\r\nyour lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.)_ That bit about the\r\nlaughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You\r\nfunny ass, you!

Bad art.\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: _(Shouts.)_ It\xe2\x80\x99s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral\r\nrottenness of the man! _(He extends his portfolio.)_ We have here\r\ndamning evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my\r\nmaturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\r\n\r\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:\r\n\r\n     Moses, Moses, king of the jews,\r\n     Wiped his arse in the _Daily News_.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Bravely.)_ Overdrawn.\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: You low cad!

Are you of the unfortunate class?\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bad one. I bear a respectable\r\ncharacter and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation,\r\nsix pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave\r\nowing to his carryings on.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of\r\nmyself as poor as I am.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless\r\nslippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)_ I treated you white. I\r\ngave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.\r\nIncautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a medium in all things. Play cricket.\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly.)_ As God is looking down on me this night\r\nif ever I laid a hand to them oylsters!\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your\r\nhonour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for\r\na safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a\r\nresult. And he interfered twict with my clothing.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: She counterassaulted.\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the\r\nscouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he\r\nremarked: keep it quiet.\r\n\r\n_(General laughter.)_\r\n\r\nGEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)_ Order in\r\ncourt! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\r\n\r\n_(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins\r\na long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say\r\nin his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but,\r\nthough branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to\r\nreform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and\r\nreturn to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths\xe2\x80\x99 child, he\r\nhad been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.\r\nThere might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn\r\nover a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping\r\npost, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by\r\nthe affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An\r\nacclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate\r\nof an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain\r\nrefrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of\r\nloveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly\r\nrural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell\xe2\x80\x99s wallpaper at one\r\nand ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to\r\nthe Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or\r\nmodel young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour\r\nreciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the\r\nboreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what\r\ntimes the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with\r\nfour acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain\r\never...._\r\n\r\n_(Renewed laughter.

O\xe2\x80\x99MOLLOY: _(In barrister\xe2\x80\x99s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with\r\na voice of pained protest.)_ This is no place for indecent levity at\r\nthe expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a\r\nbeargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My\r\nclient is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a\r\nstowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up\r\nmisdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on\r\nby hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence\r\nbeing quite permitted in my client\xe2\x80\x99s native place, the land of the\r\nPharaoh. _Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at\r\ncarnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of\r\nby Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would\r\ndeal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and\r\nsomnambulism in my client\xe2\x80\x99s family. If the accused could speak he could\r\na tale unfold\xe2\x80\x94one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between\r\nthe covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from\r\ncobbler\xe2\x80\x99s weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian\r\nextraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar\xe2\x80\x99s vest and trousers,\r\napologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and looks about\r\nhim dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches\r\nhis belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes\r\nthe court, pointing one thumb heavenward.)_ Him makee velly muchee fine\r\nnight. _(He begins to lilt simply.)_\r\n\r\n     Li li poo lil chile\r\n     Blingee pigfoot evly night\r\n     Payee two shilly...\r\n\r\n_(He is howled down.)_\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99MOLLOY: _(Hotly to the populace.)_ This is a lonehand fight. By\r\nHades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this\r\nfashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has\r\nsuperseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically,\r\nwithout wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused\r\nwas not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered\r\nwith. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very\r\nown daughter. _(Bloom takes J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s hand and raises it to his\r\nlips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that\r\nthe hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute\r\nBloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the\r\nworld to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object\r\nto or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some\r\ndastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will\r\non her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I\r\nknow. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his\r\nextensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of\r\nwhich will now be shown. _(To Bloom.)_ I suggest that you will do the\r\nhandsome thing.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: A penny in the pound.\r\n\r\n_(The image of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in\r\nsilver haze is projected on the wall.

He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless\r\nglobes as I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command\r\nperformance of _La Cigale_. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made\r\nimproper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on\r\nthe following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the\r\npost a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl\r\nwith the Three Pairs of Stays_.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose,\r\nsteps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell\r\nquizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)_\r\nAlso to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person.

Subsequently\r\nhe enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in\r\nmy honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the\r\ninformation that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant\r\npurloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!\r\n\r\n_(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward.)_\r\n\r\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: _(Screaming.)_ Stop thief! Hurrah there,\r\nBluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs.)_ Here are the darbies.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome\r\ncompliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my\r\nfrostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed\r\nhimself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his\r\nfortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing\r\nmy livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon\r\ngarnished sable, a buck\xe2\x80\x99s head couped or. He lauded almost\r\nextravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose\r\ndrawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden\r\ntreasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He\r\nurged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to\r\ndefile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,\r\njackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets\r\nwith braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she\r\nstrikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me. Because he saw me on the polo\r\nground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of\r\nIreland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger\r\nDennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob\r\n_Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car\r\nand sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold\r\nafter dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still.\r\nIt represents a partially nude se\xc3\xb1orita, frail and lovely (his wife, as\r\nhe solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit\r\nintercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me\r\nto do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He\r\nimplored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise\r\nhim as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most\r\nvicious horsewhipping.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.\r\n\r\n_(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters\r\nreceived from Bloom.)_\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Stamps her jingling spurs in a\r\nsudden paroxysm of fury.)_ I will, by the God above me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll scourge\r\nthe pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll flay him\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(His eyes closing, quails expectantly.)_ Here? _(He squirms.)_\r\nAgain! _(He pants cringing.)_ I love the danger.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it hot for\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart!

A warm\r\ntingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively.)_ O, did you,\r\nmy fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the surprise of\r\nyour life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever\r\nbargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into\r\nfury.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)_\r\nMake him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within\r\nan inch of his life. The cat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien.)_ O\r\ncold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive.

He should be soundly trounced!\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet\r\nviolently.)_ I\xe2\x80\x99ll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since he\r\nwas pupped! To dare address me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll flog him black and blue in the\r\npublic streets. I\xe2\x80\x99ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel.

Traces of\r\nelephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are\r\nmarked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent.\r\nHe is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in\r\nconsequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a\r\nfamily complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to\r\nbe more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal\r\nexamination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,\r\naxillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be _virgo\r\nintacta._\r\n\r\n_(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)_\r\n\r\nDR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked.

He is practically a total abstainer and I can\r\naffirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food,\r\ncold dried grocer\xe2\x80\x99s peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish\r\nmanufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He\r\nwas, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree\r\nreformatory.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll nurse you in proper fashion. _(He horserides\r\ncockhorse, leaping in the, in the saddle.)_ The lady goes a pace a pace\r\nand the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a\r\ngallop a gallop a gallop.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: _(Pulls at Bello.)_ Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nZOE: _(Pulling at Florry.)_ Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet,\r\nsuckeress?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Stifling.)_ Can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nBELLO: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. Wait. _(He holds in his breath.)_ Curse it. Here.\r\nThis bung\xe2\x80\x99s about burst. _(He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting\r\nhis features, farts loudly.)_ Take that! _(He recorks himself.)_ Yes,\r\nby Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(A sweat breaking out over him.)_ Not man. _(He sniffs.)_\r\nWoman.\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Stands up.)_ No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for\r\nhas come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a\r\nthing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your\r\nmale garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk\r\nluxuriously rustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Shrinks.)_ Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I\r\ntiptouch it with my nails?\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Points to his whores.)_ As they are now so will you be,\r\nwigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven\r\narmpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be\r\nlaced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with\r\nwhalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge,\r\nwhile your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in\r\nnettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things\r\nstamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for\r\nAlice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha\r\nand Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing\r\nbut the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind\r\nyou...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large\r\nmale hands and nose, leering mouth.)_ I tried her things on only twice,\r\na small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to\r\nsave the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest\r\nthrift.\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Jeers.)_ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? And showed\r\noff coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds\r\nyour unskirted thighs and hegoat\xe2\x80\x99s udders in various poses of\r\nsurrender, eh? Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop\r\nshift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her\r\nlast rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel,\r\neh?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Guffaws.)_ Christ Almighty it\xe2\x80\x99s too tickling, this! You were a\r\nnicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay\r\nswooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be\r\nviolated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.\r\nP., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,\r\nHenri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus,\r\nthe varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid\r\nNewfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. _(He guffaws\r\nagain.)_ Christ, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make a Siamese cat laugh?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Her hands and features working.)_ It was Gerald converted me\r\nto be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High\r\nSchool play _Vice Versa_. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink,\r\nfascinated by sister\xe2\x80\x99s stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint\r\nand gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(With wicked glee.)_ Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you\r\ntook your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on\r\nthe smoothworn throne.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy.\r\n_(Earnestly.)_ And really it\xe2\x80\x99s better the position... because often I\r\nused to wet...\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Sternly.)_ No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the\r\ncorner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Do it\r\nstanding, sir! I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a\r\ntrace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you\xe2\x80\x99ll find I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nmartinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\r\n\r\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices.)_ He went through a form\r\nof clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the\r\nBlack church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn\r\nat an address in D\xe2\x80\x99Olier street while he presented himself indecently\r\nto the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly\r\nencouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an\r\nunsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public\r\nconveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner\r\nto all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol\r\nworks did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to\r\nsee if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the\r\ngross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper\r\npresented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a\r\npostal order?\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Whistles loudly.)_ Say!

His bangle bracelets fall.)_\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Satirically.)_ By day you will souse and bat our smelling\r\nunderclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines\r\nwith dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won\xe2\x80\x99t that be\r\nnice? _(He places a ruby ring on her finger.)_ And there now! With this\r\nring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Thank you, mistress.\r\n\r\nBELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in\r\nthe different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh\xe2\x80\x99s the cook\xe2\x80\x99s, a sandy one.\r\nAy, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like\r\nchampagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right\r\nwell, miss, with the hairbrush. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be taught the error of your\r\nways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear\r\nfortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately\r\nscented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their\r\nlives. _(He chuckles.)_ My boys will be no end charmed to see you so\r\nladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before\r\nthe wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta\r\nMarsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the\r\nHanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work\r\nat a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers?\r\n_(He points.)_ For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry,\r\nbasket in mouth. _(He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvulva.)_ There\xe2\x80\x99s fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a\r\nhardon? _(He shoves his arm in a bidder\xe2\x80\x99s face.)_ Here wet the deck and\r\nwipe it round!\r\n\r\nA BIDDER: A florin.\r\n\r\n_(Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s lacquey rings his handbell.)_\r\n\r\nTHE LACQUEY: Barang!\r\n\r\nA VOICE: One and eightpence too much.\r\n\r\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Gives a rap with his gavel.)_ Two bar. Rockbottom figure and\r\ncheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine shis points.\r\nHandle hrim. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If\r\nI had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid\r\ngallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His\r\nsire\xe2\x80\x99s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.\r\nWhoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! _(He brands his initial C on Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncroup.)_ So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\r\n\r\nA DARKVISAGED MAN: _(In disguised accent.)_ Hoondert punt sterlink.\r\n\r\nVOICES: _(Subdued.)_ For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Gaily.)_ Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short\r\nskirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a\r\npotent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long\r\nstraight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better\r\ninstincts of the _blas\xc3\xa9_ man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk\r\non four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,\r\nthe thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of\r\nfascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with\r\nforefinger in mouth.)_ O, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re hinting at now!\r\n\r\nBELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? _(He\r\nstoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds\r\nof Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s haunches.)_ Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing,\r\nbirdy, sing. It\xe2\x80\x99s as limp as a boy of six\xe2\x80\x99s doing his pooly behind a\r\ncart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. _(Loudly.)_ Can you do a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njob?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Eccles street...\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Sarcastically.)_ I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt your feelings for the world\r\nbut there\xe2\x80\x99s a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned,\r\nmy gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well\r\nfor you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and\r\nwarts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee\r\nto knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He\xe2\x80\x99s no eunuch. A shock of red\r\nhair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine\r\nmonths, my lad! Holy ginger, it\xe2\x80\x99s kicking and coughing up and down in\r\nher guts already! That makes you wild, don\xe2\x80\x99t it? Touches the spot? _(He\r\nspits in contempt.)_ Spittoon!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I was indecently treated, I... Inform the police. Hundred\r\npounds. Unmentionable.

The _Cuckoos\xe2\x80\x99 Rest!_ Why\r\nnot? How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets,\r\nflatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male\r\nprostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about.\r\nSauce for the goose, my gander O.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: They... I...\r\n\r\nBELLO: _(Cuttingly.)_ Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet\r\nyou bought at Wren\xe2\x80\x99s auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to\r\nfind the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue\r\nyou carried home in the rain for art for art\xe2\x80\x99s sake. They will violate\r\nthe secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your\r\nhandbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in\r\nyour ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will\r\nreturn. I will prove...\r\n\r\nA VOICE: Swear!\r\n\r\n_(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his\r\nteeth.)_\r\n\r\nBELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late.

I was hidden in cheap pink paper that\r\nsmelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen,\r\nstories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice\r\nand bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with\r\ntestimonial from ruptured gentleman.

Even to sit\r\nwhere a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to\r\ngrant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted\r\nwhite sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.\r\n\r\nTHE WATERFALL:\r\n\r\n     Phillaphulla Poulaphouca\r\n     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: Ssh!

Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: This is yours.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: How is that? _Le distrait_ or absentminded beggar. _(He\r\nfumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object\r\nfalls.)_ That fell.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.)_ This.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Quietly.)_ You had better hand over that cash to me to take\r\ncare of. Why pay more?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Hands him all his coins.)_ Be just before you are generous.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I will but is it wise? _(He counts.)_ One, seven, eleven, and\r\nfive. Six. Eleven. I don\xe2\x80\x99t answer for what you may have lost.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next\r\nLessing says. Thirsty fox. _(He laughs loudly.)_ Burying his\r\ngrandmother. Probably he killed her.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven.

Must get glasses.\r\nBroke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all\r\nflat. _(He draws the match away. It goes out.)_ Brain thinks. Near:\r\nfar. Ineluctable modality of the visible. _(He frowns mysteriously.)_\r\nHm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\r\n\r\nZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: _(Nods.)_ Mr Lambe from London.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: _(Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.)

You have a\r\ncar?...\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to\r\nthe car brought up against the scaffolding.)_ Two commercials that were\r\nstanding fizz in Jammet\xe2\x80\x99s. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two\r\nquid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the\r\njolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan\xe2\x80\x99s car and down to nighttown.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs.)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the\r\nmots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.\r\n_(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)_ Thanks be to God we\r\nhave it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: _(Tries to laugh.)_ He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just\r\nvisiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him (poor\r\nfellow, he\xe2\x80\x99s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together\r\nand I was just making my way home...\r\n\r\n_(The horse neighs.)_\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after\r\nwe left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s and I told him to pull up\r\nand got off to see. _(He laughs.)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.\r\nWill I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in\r\nCabra, what?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\r\n\r\n_(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint,\r\ndrawls at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(Scratches his nape.)_ Sandycove! _(He bends down and\r\ncalls to Stephen.)_ Eh! _(He calls again.)_ Eh! He\xe2\x80\x99s covered with\r\nshavings anyhow. Take care they didn\xe2\x80\x99t lift anything off him.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he\xe2\x80\x99ll get over it. No bones broken. Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll shove along. _(He laughs.)_ I\xe2\x80\x99ve a rendezvous in the morning.\r\nBurying the dead. Safe home!\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE: _(Neighs.)_ Hohohohohome.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Good night. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just wait and take him along in a few...\r\n\r\n_(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse\r\nharness jingles.)_\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing.)_ Night.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Night.\r\n\r\n_(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The\r\ncar and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the\r\nsideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s plight.\r\nThe jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the\r\nfarther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb\r\nand palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the\r\nsleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom\r\nconveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car\r\njingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny\r\nKelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand\r\nassuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling\r\nhoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo\r\nlay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s hat, festooned with shavings,\r\nand ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by\r\nthe shoulder.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Eh! Ho! _(There is no answer; he bends again.)_ Mr Dedalus!\r\n_(There is no answer.)_ The name if you call.

He calls again.)_ Stephen!\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Groans.)_ Who? Black panther. Vampire. _(He sighs and\r\nstretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)_\r\n\r\n     Who... drive... Fergus now\r\n     And pierce... wood\xe2\x80\x99s woven shade?...\r\n\r\n_(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)_\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. _(He bends again and undoes the\r\nbuttons of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat.)_ To breathe. _(He brushes the\r\nwoodshavings from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s clothes with light hand and fingers.)_ One\r\npound seven. Not hurt anyhow. _(He listens.)_ What?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _(Murmurs.)_\r\n\r\n     ... shadows... the woods\r\n     ... white breast... dim sea.\r\n\r\n_(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body.

His\r\n(Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a\r\nbit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr\r\nBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry\r\nwater available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit\r\nupon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the\r\ncabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt\r\nbridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk\r\nand soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce\r\nhe was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon\r\nhim to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and\r\nmeans during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he\r\nwas rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly\r\nadvisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in\r\ntheir then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen,\r\nalways assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly\r\nafter a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having\r\nforgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had\r\ndone yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together\r\nalong Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nthe distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of\r\nMontgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence\r\ndebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin\xe2\x80\x99s. But\r\nas he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for\r\nhire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some\r\nfellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was\r\nno symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was\r\nanything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by\r\nemitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head,\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nThis was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\r\nthere was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\r\nwhich they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett\xe2\x80\x99s and the\r\nSignal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\r\ndirection of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped\r\nby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,\r\nto vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,\r\nentering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made\r\nlight of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed\r\nfor time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it\r\ncleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they\r\ndandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a\r\nfare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his\r\ncompanion _\xc3\xa0 propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of\r\nsome little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great\r\nNorthern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of\r\ncourse all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the\r\nbackdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say\r\ngruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the\r\nDock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its\r\nC division police station. Between this point and the high at present\r\nunlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,\r\nassociated with Baird\xe2\x80\x99s the stonecutter\xe2\x80\x99s in his mind somehow in Talbot\r\nplace, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as\r\nhis _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of\r\nJames Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were,\r\nthe very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities\r\nof the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of\r\nlife, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbaker\xe2\x80\x99s it is said.\r\n\r\n_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not\r\nyet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in\r\ncomplete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact\r\ndisgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of\r\nnighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely\r\npermissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of\r\nthe nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age\r\nparticularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence\r\nof liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as\r\neven a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the\r\nscene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for\r\nthat man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might\r\nhave been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or,\r\nfailing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day\r\nbefore Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant\r\nto say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got\r\nbruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those\r\npolicemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in\r\nthe service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or\r\ntwo in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole\r\nthrough a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet\r\nparts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law\r\nwere well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to\r\nprotect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping\r\nsoldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off\r\nat any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians\r\nshould by any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away\r\nyour time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character\r\nbesides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the\r\n_demimonde_ ran away with a lot of \xc2\xa3. s. d. into the bargain and the\r\ngreatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the\r\nmuch vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old\r\nwine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing\r\naperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch\r\nbeliever in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably\r\ndrew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of\r\nyour being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he\r\ncommented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting\r\n_confr\xc3\xa8res_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his\r\nbrother medicos under all the circs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\r\nwhatsoever of any kind.\r\n\r\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\r\nof the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a\r\nbrazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one\r\nattracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord\r\nstopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren\r\ncobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just\r\nmake out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom\r\nof the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had\r\nbeen mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small\r\neffort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a\r\n_quondam_ friend of his father\xe2\x80\x99s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew\r\nnearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches\r\nsaluted again, calling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Night!\r\n\r\nStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\r\ncompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch\r\nas he always believed in minding his own business moved off but\r\nnevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety\r\nthough not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he\r\nknew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next\r\nto nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising\r\npeaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some\r\nsecluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames\r\nembankment category they might be hanging about there or simply\r\nmarauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell\r\nswoop at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there\r\nto point a moral, gagged and garrotted.\r\n\r\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,\r\nthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him\r\nand his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of\r\ninspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a\r\ncertain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His\r\ngrandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of\r\na publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.\r\nRumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of\r\nthe lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\r\nfine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\r\nsome relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had\r\nenjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This\r\ntherefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though\r\ndissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with\r\nfacetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\r\n\r\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\r\nNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings. His friends\r\nhad all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called\r\nhim to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of\r\nother uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of\r\nStephen to tell him where on God\xe2\x80\x99s earth he could get something,\r\nanything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the\r\nwashkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they\r\nwere connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences\r\nhappening at the same time if the whole thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a complete\r\nfabrication from start to finish. Anyhow he was all in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m on the rocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You\r\nmay mention my name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t teach in a school, man. I was\r\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck\r\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\r\n\r\nCorley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to\r\ndo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody\r\ntart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs\r\nMaloney\xe2\x80\x99s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over\r\nin Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person\r\naddressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t said a word about it.\r\n\r\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it\r\nstill Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he\r\nknew that Corley\xe2\x80\x99s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was\r\nhardly deserving of much credence. However _haud ignarus malorum\r\nmiseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially\r\nas luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the\r\nmonth on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of\r\nfact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream\r\nof the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley\xe2\x80\x99s head that he was\r\nliving in affluence and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a thing to do but hand out the needful.\r\nWhereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of\r\nfinding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a\r\nbob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get\r\nsufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his\r\nchagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the\r\nresult of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the\r\nmoment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in\r\nthat contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse\r\nin fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough\r\nsearch though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly\r\nremembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did\r\nhe buy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in\r\nthe dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\r\n\r\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him\r\none of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, Corley answered, you\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you back one\r\ntime. Who\xe2\x80\x99s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse\r\nin Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good\r\nword for us to get me taken on there. I\xe2\x80\x99d carry a sandwichboard only\r\nthe girl in the office told me they\xe2\x80\x99re full up for the next three\r\nweeks, man. God, you\xe2\x80\x99ve to book ahead, man, you\xe2\x80\x99d think it was for the\r\nCarl Rosa. I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as\r\na crossing sweeper.\r\n\r\nSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six\r\nhe got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky\r\nthat he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam\xe2\x80\x99s, the shipchandler\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nbookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s back with\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he\r\nwas lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and\r\ndisorderly and refusing to go with the constable.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the\r\ncobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation\r\nwatchman\xe2\x80\x99s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,\r\nwas having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own\r\nprivate account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same\r\ntime now and then at Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s anything but immaculately attired\r\ninterlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though\r\nwhere he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the\r\nremotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give\r\npoints to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on\r\nhis very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally\r\ntestifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his\r\nhangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one\r\npreying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put\r\nit, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street\r\nchanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the\r\noption of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether. In any case he\r\nhad a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that\r\nhour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.\r\n\r\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his\r\npractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the\r\nblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he\r\nsaid, laughingly, Stephen, that is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named\r\nBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\r\n\r\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr\r\nBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the\r\ndirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,\r\nmoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,\r\nwhereupon he observed evasively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it\r\nhis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much\r\ndid you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the\r\nintelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he\r\ninvariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according\r\nto his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he\r\nwith a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of\r\nthe question. And even supposing you did you won\xe2\x80\x99t get in after what\r\noccurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why\r\ndid you leave your father\xe2\x80\x99s house?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To seek misfortune, was Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom\r\ndiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on\r\nyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of\r\nconversation that he had moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects\r\nthan one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one. He takes great\r\npride, quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he\r\nhasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row\r\nterminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,\r\nthat is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred\r\ntheir third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally\r\nstation belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,\r\nwhich they did.\r\n\r\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it\r\nwas, Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his\r\nfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by\r\nthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell\r\ncocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he\r\ncould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings\r\nthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and\r\nKatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells\r\nand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in\r\naccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on\r\nthe days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or\r\nsomething like that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t personally repose much trust\r\nin that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,\r\nDr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your\r\nshoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all\r\nprobability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.\r\nOf course you didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice as much as I did. But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t occasion\r\nme the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic\r\nwas put in your drink for some ulterior object.\r\n\r\nHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a\r\nversatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was\r\nrapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,\r\nbade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future\r\nas a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services\r\nin addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from\r\ncertain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid\r\nat Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an\r\nexceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that\r\nfrankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be\r\nat the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or\r\njealousy, pure and simple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking\r\nyour brains, he ventured to throw out.\r\n\r\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by\r\nfriendliness which he gave at Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s at present morose expression of\r\nfeatures did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the\r\nproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge\r\nby two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about\r\nsaw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to\r\nhimself allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that\r\neffect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities\r\nthough he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both\r\nends meet.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the men\xe2\x80\x99s public urinal they perceived an icecream car\r\nround which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were\r\ngetting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a\r\nparticularly animated way, there being some little differences between\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!_\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi\xc3\xb9..._\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Dice lui, per\xc3\xb2!_\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Mezzo._\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa pi\xc3\xb9..._\r\n\r\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, an unpretentious\r\nwooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been\r\nbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few\r\nhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat\r\nFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual\r\nfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few\r\nmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet\r\ncorner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous\r\ncollection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the\r\ngenus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified\r\nby conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest\r\nto break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the\r\nshape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.\r\n\r\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order\r\nthese commodities quietly. The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or\r\nwhatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes\r\napparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous\r\nindividual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still\r\nstared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention\r\nto the floor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,\r\nhe having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,\r\nthough, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his\r\n_prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ in an audible tone of voice _\xc3\xa0 propos_ of the battle royal in\r\nthe street which was still raging fast and furious:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not\r\nwrite your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious\r\nand full. _Belladonna. Voglio._\r\n\r\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering\r\nfrom lassitude generally, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the\r\ninward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were\r\nabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that\r\nsurrounds it.\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ put a\r\nboiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the\r\ntable and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.\r\nAfter which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to\r\nhave a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For\r\nwhich reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he\r\ndid the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was\r\ntemporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,\r\nlike names. Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.\r\nShakespeares were as common as Murphies. What\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name\r\nwas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\r\n\r\nThe redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded\r\nStephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely\r\nby asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what might your name be?\r\n\r\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion\xe2\x80\x99s boot but\r\nStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected\r\nquarter, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dedalus.\r\n\r\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,\r\nrather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old\r\nHollands and water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently\r\neavesdropping too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same\r\nway and nodding. All Irish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole\r\nbusiness and he was just asking himself what possible connection when\r\nthe sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the\r\nshelter with the remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his\r\nshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.\r\n\r\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his\r\ngestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.\r\nCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\r\n\r\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then\r\nhe screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the\r\nnight with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pom! he then shouted once.\r\n\r\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,\r\nthere being still a further egg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pom! he shouted twice.\r\n\r\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\r\nbloodthirstily:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,\r\n\r\nNever missed nor he never will._\r\n\r\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness\xe2\x80\x99 sake just felt like\r\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the\r\nBisley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Beg pardon, the sailor said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\r\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He\r\ntoured the wide world with Hengler\xe2\x80\x99s Royal Circus. I seen him do that\r\nin Stockholm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.\r\nKnow where that is?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhere I hails from. I belongs there. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I hails from. My\r\nlittle woman\xe2\x80\x99s down there. She\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for me, I know. _For England,\r\nhome and beauty_. She\xe2\x80\x99s my own true wife I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen for seven years\r\nnow, sailing about.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming\r\nto the mariner\xe2\x80\x99s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a\r\nrainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a\r\nnumber of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,\r\nEnoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember\r\nCaoc O\xe2\x80\x99Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way\r\nof poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.\r\nNever about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the\r\nabsentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he\r\nfinally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent\r\nhis better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,\r\nat the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the\r\ndeep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the\r\npublican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and\r\nonions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on\r\nher knee, _post mortem_ child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my\r\ngalloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I\r\nremain with much love your brokenhearted husband W. B. Murphy.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one\r\nof the jarvies with the request:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?\r\n\r\nThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die\r\nof plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object\r\nwas passed from hand to hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, the sailor said.\r\n\r\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow\r\nstammers, proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We come up this morning eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The threemaster _Rosevean_\r\nfrom Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this\r\nafternoon. There\xe2\x80\x99s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket\r\nand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,\r\nleaning on the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve circumnavigated\r\na bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and\r\nNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I\r\nseen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,\r\nthe Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever\r\nscuttled a ship. I seen Russia. _Gospodi pomilyou_. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the\r\nRussians prays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You seen queer sights, don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking, put in a jarvey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer\r\nthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an\r\nanchor same as I chew that quid.\r\n\r\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\r\nteeth, bit ferociously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and\r\nthe livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed\r\nto be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.\r\nThe printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia._\r\n\r\nAll focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage\r\nwomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,\r\nsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of\r\nthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like\r\nbreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can\xe2\x80\x99t bear no more\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSee them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse\xe2\x80\x99s liver\r\nraw.\r\n\r\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns\r\nfor several minutes if not more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.\r\n\r\nNobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Glass. That boggles \xe2\x80\x99em. Glass.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\r\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran\r\nas follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Se\xc3\xb1or A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,\r\nChile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.\r\nThough not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the\r\neggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the\r\nLazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which\r\noccasion the former\xe2\x80\x99s ball passed through the latter\xe2\x80\x99s hat) having\r\ndetected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he\r\nrepresented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after\r\nhaving boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the\r\nfictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some\r\nsuspicions of our friend\xe2\x80\x99s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in\r\na way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some\r\nWednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say\r\nthat he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was\r\nat heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had\r\nconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead\r\nwhich was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work\r\na pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up\r\nwith the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it\r\ndid come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd\xe2\x80\x99s heart it was\r\nnot so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering\r\nthe fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there\r\nand back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone\r\nand be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose\r\nliver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,\r\nPlymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive\r\ntour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern\r\nBabylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,\r\nabbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing\r\njust struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze\r\naround on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a\r\nconcert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure\r\nresorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,\r\nEastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the\r\nChannel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly\r\nremunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or\r\nlocal ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M\xe2\x80\x99Coy type lend me your valise\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star\r\nIrish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal\r\nconsort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes\r\nand Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of\r\nsuccess, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some\r\nfellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and\r\nthus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\r\n\r\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was\r\nto be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with\r\nthe times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was\r\nmooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments\r\nwith the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete\r\nfogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly\r\nwas for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public\r\nat large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\r\n\r\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\r\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\r\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\r\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\r\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took\r\nme for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more\r\nhumdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the\r\ngrind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at\r\nher spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.\r\nThere were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home\r\nisland, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora\r\nof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\r\nDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there\r\nwas a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in\r\nWicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood\r\nfor elderly wheelmen so long as it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come down, and in the wilds\r\nof Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93il_ was exceedingly\r\ngrand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that\r\nthe influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering\r\nthe signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic\r\nassociations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, George IV,\r\nrhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt\r\nwith all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when\r\nyoung men\xe2\x80\x99s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off\r\nthe cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their\r\nleft leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s run from the\r\npillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely\r\nin its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be\r\ndesired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of\r\ncuriosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created\r\nthe route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the\r\nother side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had\r\nlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened\r\nand every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a\r\nhouse, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly\r\nadded, the chinks does.\r\n\r\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the\r\nglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his\r\nback. Knife like that.\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in\r\nkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.\r\nFellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. _Prepare to\r\nmeet your God_, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.\r\n\r\nHis heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further\r\nquestions even should they by any chance want to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable\r\n_stiletto_.\r\n\r\nAfter which harrowing _d\xc3\xa9nouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he\r\nsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before\r\nin his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in\r\nthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought\r\nthe park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account\r\nof them using knives.\r\n\r\nAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is\r\nbliss_ Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both\r\ninstinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the\r\nstrictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,\r\n_alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid\r\nfrom his boiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work of\r\nart, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the\r\nimpression that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand one jot of what was going on.\r\nFunny, very!\r\n\r\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and\r\nstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the\r\nnatives _choza de_, another the seaman\xe2\x80\x99s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as\r\nhe was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He\r\nvividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well\r\nas yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the\r\nland troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively\r\nspeaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was\r\njust turned fifteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\r\n\r\nThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\r\n\r\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or\r\nno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, you\xe2\x80\x99ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he\r\nhad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences\r\nbut he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the\r\nsawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the\r\nboats?\r\n\r\nOur _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before\r\nanswering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.\r\nSalt junk all the time.\r\n\r\nTired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not\r\nlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,\r\nfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the\r\nglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,\r\nit covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly\r\nwhat it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at\r\nthe lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a\r\nsuperannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the\r\nnot particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at\r\nit and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone\r\nsomewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried\r\nto find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the\r\nantipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not\r\nexactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil\r\nthere was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going\r\ninto the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that\r\nthe sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things\r\nsomebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence\r\nthough it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that\r\nsort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery\r\nand insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for\r\nthat very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable\r\ninstitution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland\r\nor seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like\r\nthat should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and\r\ncoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid\r\nthe elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that\r\nevery man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the\r\nwintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to\r\ncapsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had\r\nexperienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,\r\nhimself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I\xe2\x80\x99ve on me\r\nand he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I\xe2\x80\x99m game for that job,\r\nshaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There\xe2\x80\x99s my son now, Danny,\r\nrun off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper\xe2\x80\x99s in Cork where\r\nhe could be drawing easy money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the\r\nside, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away\r\nfrom the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy\r\ngetup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\r\n\r\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow\r\nshirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was\r\nto be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent\r\nan anchor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.\r\nI must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It\xe2\x80\x99s them black lads I objects\r\nto. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.\r\n\r\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged\r\nhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the\r\nmariner\xe2\x80\x99s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s sideface looking frowningly rather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying\r\nbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the\r\nname of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\r\n\r\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.\r\nSomeway in his. Squeezing or.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And\r\nthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his\r\nfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\r\n\r\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s livid face did\r\nactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the\r\nunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this\r\ntime stretched over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone\r\ntoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\r\n\r\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression\r\nof before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what\xe2\x80\x99s the number for? loafer number two queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time\r\nwith some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the\r\ndirection of the questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.\r\n\r\nAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his\r\nalleged end:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94As bad as old Antonio,\r\n     For he left me on my ownio.\r\n\r\nThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\r\npeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on\r\nher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,\r\nscarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment\r\nflusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink\r\nsheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had\r\nlaid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though\r\nwhy pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round\r\nthe door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that\r\nafternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the\r\nlane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)\r\nand begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed\r\nrather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to\r\nadmit he had washed his wife\xe2\x80\x99s undergarments when soiled in Holles\r\nstreet and women would and did too a man\xe2\x80\x99s similar garments initialled\r\nwith Bewley and Draper\xe2\x80\x99s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they\r\nreally loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still\r\njust then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female\xe2\x80\x99s room more than\r\nher company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a\r\nrude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the _Evening\r\nTelegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side\r\nof the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was\r\nnot exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of\r\ngazers round skipper Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s nautical chest and then there was no more\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The gunboat, the keeper said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,\r\nhow a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with\r\ndisease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober\r\nsenses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of\r\ncourse I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.\r\nStill no matter what the cause is from...\r\n\r\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely\r\nremarking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\r\nroaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to\r\nbuy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\r\n\r\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a\r\nprude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be\r\nput a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart\r\nfrom any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,\r\nwere not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a\r\nthing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a\r\nstalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a\r\npolicy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would\r\nconfer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\r\nin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,\r\nas distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\r\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men\r\nas the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have\r\nsuch inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\r\n\r\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\r\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\r\ntherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for\r\nthe possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I\r\ncan hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\r\npractical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both\r\nbeing excluded by court etiquette.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\r\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he\r\nfelt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly\r\nrejoining:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Simple? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant\r\nyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a\r\nblue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for\r\ninstance to invent those rays R\xc3\xb6ntgen did or the telescope like Edison,\r\nthough I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,\r\nand the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural\r\nphenomenon such as electricity but it\xe2\x80\x99s a horse of quite another colour\r\nto say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\r\nof the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nOn this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\r\nwere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference\r\nin their respective ages, clashed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\r\noriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure about that.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a matter for everyman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and, without dragging in the\r\nsectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_\r\nthere. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were\r\ngenuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbig question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them\r\nlike _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely\r\nbetter than I, of course I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you drink that\r\ncoffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike one of our skipper\xe2\x80\x99s bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what\r\nhe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got. Try a bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the\r\nmoment refusing to dictate further.\r\n\r\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir\r\nor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with\r\nsomething approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance\r\n(and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond\r\nyea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they\r\nwere in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic\r\nevenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the\r\nlower orders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful\r\nrecollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been\r\nprominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration\r\nindeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to\r\nbelieve, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to\r\nspeak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas\r\nhe remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical\r\ninspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary\r\nwhich possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble\xe2\x80\x99s Vi-Cocoa on\r\naccount of the medical analysis involved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug\r\nfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and\r\ntook a sip of the offending beverage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still it\xe2\x80\x99s solid food, his good genius urged, I\xe2\x80\x99m a stickler for solid\r\nfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but\r\nregular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental\r\nor manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that\r\nknife. I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated\r\narticle, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly\r\nRoman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was\r\nthe least conspicuous point about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our mutual friend\xe2\x80\x99s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of\r\nknives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are\r\ngenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\r\nlie like old boots. Look at him.\r\n\r\nYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was\r\nfull of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it\r\nwas quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire\r\nfabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent\r\nprobability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly\r\naccurate gospel.\r\n\r\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\r\nSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a\r\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\r\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a\r\njail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to\r\nassociate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill\r\nfraternity. He might even have done for his man supposing it was his\r\nown case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he\r\nkilled him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in\r\ndurance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to\r\nthe dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our\r\nnational poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above\r\ndescribed. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable\r\nweakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like\r\nthose jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner\r\nwho sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner\r\n_Hesperus_ and etcetera. And when all was said and done the lies a\r\nfellow told about himself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t probably hold a proverbial candle to\r\nthe wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mind you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s all a pure invention, he resumed.\r\nAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,\r\nthough that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the\r\nmidget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some\r\nAztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t straighten\r\ntheir legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he\r\nproceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews\r\nor whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly\r\npowerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as\r\ngods. There\xe2\x80\x99s an example again of simple souls.\r\n\r\nHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\r\nreminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the\r\nboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the\r\nmanagement in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host\r\nof admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him\r\nthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually\r\nfell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically\r\nincompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the\r\nback touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he\r\nwas none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the\r\nfish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in\r\nlittle Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking\r\nfellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless\r\nnecessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to\r\nhave a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or\r\nher next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\r\nthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own\r\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\r\ncarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.\r\nMy wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could\r\nactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\r\n(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite\r\ndark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate\r\naccounts for character. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry\r\nin Italian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very\r\npassionate about ten shillings. _Roberto ruba roba sua_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown\r\nlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles\r\ntriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san\r\nTommaso Mastino.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the\r\nblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare\r\nstreet museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,\r\nand I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid\r\nproportions of hips, bosom. You simply don\xe2\x80\x99t knock against those kind\r\nof women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a\r\nway you find but what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about is the female form. Besides\r\nthey have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly\r\nenhances a woman\xe2\x80\x99s natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled\r\nstockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nthing I simply hate to see.\r\n\r\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\r\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,\r\ncollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course\r\nhad his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and\r\nweathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all\r\nthose perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him\r\nor words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\r\n\r\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt\xe2\x80\x99s rock, wreck\r\nof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for\r\nthe moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry\r\nCampbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand. That was the talk\r\nof the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of\r\noriginal verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish\r\n_Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore\r\nin commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about\r\nthe case of the s. s. _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_\r\nwhich was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with\r\nall hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the _Mona_\xe2\x80\x99s, said he\r\nwas afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it\r\nappears, in her hold.\r\n\r\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him\r\nto unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just\r\ngently dropping off into a peaceful doze.\r\n\r\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,\r\nstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore\r\ndue left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who\r\nnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his\r\nburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew\r\nand, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig\r\nout of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had\r\na shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a man\xc5\x93uvre after the\r\ncounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared\r\nto all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when\r\nduly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and\r\ngirders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was\r\nall radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some\r\nperson or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by\r\nthe cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a\r\nbrief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,\r\nevidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the\r\nnoise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the\r\nground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped\r\nanyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly\r\ndisturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of\r\nthe corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking\r\nup, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now\r\npractically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin\r\nin all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before\r\nshifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again\r\nin to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its\r\nmost virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and\r\nfamiliarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a\r\ncool \xc2\xa3 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass\r\nproceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the\r\nend of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink\r\nwithout a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed\r\nonly once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of\r\nbusiness if\xe2\x80\x94a big if, however\xe2\x80\x94he had contrived to cure himself of his\r\nparticular partiality.\r\n\r\nAll meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,\r\ncoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the\r\nsame thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra\r\nbasin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there\r\nonly no ships ever called.\r\n\r\nThere were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au\r\nfait_.\r\n\r\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only\r\nrock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr\r\nWorthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he\r\nadvised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his\r\nprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.\r\n\r\nThat worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words\r\ngrowled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or\r\nother in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s sharp ears heard him then\r\nexpectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have\r\nlodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and\r\nmaking water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in\r\nquestion. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful\r\nlibation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the\r\n_soir\xc3\xa9e_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94The biscuits was as hard as brass\r\n     And the beef as salt as Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s arse.\r\n     O, Johnny Lever!\r\n     Johnny Lever, O!\r\n\r\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene\r\nand regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form\r\nprovided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to\r\ngrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent\r\nthe natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he\r\ndescribed in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none\r\non the face of God\xe2\x80\x99s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal\r\nin large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every\r\nyear, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained\r\nout of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through\r\nthe nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot\r\nmore surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly\r\nbecame general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any\r\nmortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel\r\nEverard down there in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find\r\nanywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated\r\n_crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the\r\nconversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of\r\npelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest\r\nfall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their\r\nlittle lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end.\r\nBrummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be\r\nIreland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the\r\nvulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at\r\nonce seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the\r\ntendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay\r\nin the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.\r\nIreland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.\r\n\r\nSilence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. The\r\nimpervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a\r\nbit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\r\n\r\nTo which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper\r\nconcurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately\r\ninterrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals\r\nand generals we\xe2\x80\x99ve got? Tell me that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial\r\nblemishes apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic\r\npeasant. He\xe2\x80\x99s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\r\n\r\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added\r\nhe cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no\r\nIrishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a\r\nfew irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say,\r\nappealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with\r\ninterest so long as they didn\xe2\x80\x99t indulge in recriminations and come to\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was\r\nrather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,\r\npending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he\r\nwas fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the\r\nchannel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for,\r\nrather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a\r\npar with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred\r\nmillion years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out\r\nand if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all\r\nhe could personally say on the matter was that as a host of\r\ncontingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it\r\nwas highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both\r\ncountries even though poles apart. Another little interesting point,\r\nthe amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,\r\nreminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against\r\nher, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of\r\nthem, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris,\r\nthe famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him\r\nforcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing,\r\nthat is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human\r\nsoul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the\r\nlessee or keeper, who probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the other person at all, he (B.)\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people\r\nlike that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and\r\nrefuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private\r\nlife and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a\r\nDannyman coming forward and turning queen\xe2\x80\x99s evidence or king\xe2\x80\x99s now like\r\nDenis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from\r\nthat he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.\r\nYet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his\r\nbosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it\r\n(while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for\r\na man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage\r\nof his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a\r\nparty to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of\r\nthe south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,\r\nafter some words passed between the two concerning her relations with\r\nthe other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted\r\nfatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative\r\npostnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just\r\nstruck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for\r\nthe actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was\r\nreliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of\r\nfact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case\r\nthat was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo\r\nSkin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought\r\nto have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses,\r\nalways farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.\r\nGenerous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any\r\nidea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So\r\nsimilarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid\r\nof some \xc2\xa3. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in\r\nthe congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin\r\nand so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the\r\nsame identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually\r\nsilenced the offender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the\r\nwhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and\r\nin a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain\r\nfacts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and\r\nall his family like me though in reality I\xe2\x80\x99m not. That was one for him.\r\nA soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a word to say for himself as\r\neveryone saw. Am I not right?\r\n\r\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride\r\nat the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to\r\nglean in a kind of a way that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all exactly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or\r\nfour eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any\r\nother, _secundum carnem_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides\r\nof the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to\r\nright and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is\r\nthough every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the\r\ngovernment it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nvery fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual\r\nequality. I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It\r\nnever reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the\r\ndue instalments plan. It\xe2\x80\x99s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate\r\npeople because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,\r\nin the next house so to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes\xe2\x80\x99 war, Stephen\r\nassented, between Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s alley and Ormond market.\r\n\r\nYes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that\r\nwas overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of\r\nconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remotely...\r\n\r\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad\r\nblood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,\r\nerroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were\r\nvery largely a question of the money question which was at the back of\r\neverything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They accuse, remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who\r\nprobably\xe2\x80\xa6 and spoke nearer to, so as the others\xe2\x80\xa6 in case they\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear, are accused of\r\nruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would\r\nyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the\r\ninquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,\r\nan uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer\r\nfor, imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper\r\nspirit. They are practical and are proved to be so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nindulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and\r\nthen orthodox as you are. But in the economic, not touching religion,\r\ndomain the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war,\r\ncompared with goahead America. Turks. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the dogma. Because if\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe they\xe2\x80\x99d go straight to heaven when they die they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntry to live better, at least so I think. That\xe2\x80\x99s the juggle on which the\r\np.p.\xe2\x80\x99s raise the wind on false pretences. I\xe2\x80\x99m, he resumed with dramatic\r\nforce, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the\r\noutset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes\r\n_pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion\r\neither, something in the neighbourhood of \xc2\xa3 300 per annum. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nvital issue at stake and it\xe2\x80\x99s feasible and would be provocative of\r\nfriendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s my idea for\r\nwhat it\xe2\x80\x99s worth. I call that patriotism. _Ubi patria_, as we learned a\r\nsmattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_. Where\r\nyou can live well, the sense is, if you work.\r\n\r\nOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this\r\nsynopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.\r\nHe could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those\r\ncrabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours\r\nof different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere\r\nbeneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.\r\n\r\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person\r\nwho owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all\r\nmust work, have to, together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest\r\npossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the\r\nthing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel\r\nnowadays. That\xe2\x80\x99s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I\r\nknow of you, after all the money expended on your education you are\r\nentitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit\r\nas much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the\r\npeasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.\r\nEach is equally important.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may\r\nbe important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called\r\nIreland for short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important\r\nbecause it belongs to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under\r\nsome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch the\r\nlatter portion. What was it you...?\r\n\r\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of\r\ncoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can\xe2\x80\x99t change the country. Let us change the subject.\r\n\r\nAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked\r\ndown but in a quandary, as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell exactly what construction\r\nto put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some\r\nkind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his\r\nrecent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way\r\nforeign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B\r\nattached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of\r\nfear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an\r\nair of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,\r\nthe eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,\r\nfailing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind\r\ninstances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in\r\nthe bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For\r\ninstance there was the case of O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy\r\nfaddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad\r\nvagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a\r\nnuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously\r\nsporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual\r\n_d\xc3\xa9nouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed\r\ninto hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a\r\nstrong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so\r\nas not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law\r\namendment act, certain names of those subp\xc5\x93naed being handed in but not\r\ndivulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.\r\nBriefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly\r\nturned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and\r\nthe tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in\r\nthe house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,\r\nthen heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high\r\npersonages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,\r\nhe reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running\r\ncounter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before\r\nunder their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good\r\nMrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the\r\nreason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women\r\nchiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being\r\nlargely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like\r\ndistinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must,\r\ntrying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of\r\na genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned\r\nhis and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the\r\ncannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a\r\ncontinental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the\r\nother hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest\r\nrung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius,\r\nthat. With brains, sir.\r\n\r\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even\r\nto wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could\r\nnot exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad\r\nhaving in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the\r\nacquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food\r\nfor reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,\r\nas such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the\r\nmind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance,\r\nrow, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,\r\nthe whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of\r\nthe world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth,\r\nviz. coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the\r\nmicroscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he\r\nmight meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy\r\nif taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the\r\ncommon groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea\r\nper column. _My Experiences_, let us say, _in a Cabman\xe2\x80\x99s Shelter_.\r\n\r\nThe pink edition extra sporting of the _Telegraph_ tell a graphic lie\r\nlay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just\r\npuzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and\r\nthe preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard\r\nwas addressed A.

P. which, he\r\nreflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94_This morning_ (Hynes put it in of course) _the remains of the late Mr\r\nPatrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,\r\nSandymount, for interment in Glasnevin.

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing\r\nthough as the event turned out the poor fool hadn\xe2\x80\x99t much reason to\r\ncongratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it\r\nreduced itself to eventually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\r\n\r\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:\r\n_Return of Parnell_. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was\r\nin that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it\r\nwas killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for\r\na time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with\r\nno-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone\r\ndown on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his\r\nsenses. Dead he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they\r\nbrought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the\r\nBoer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their\r\nmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and\r\nnot singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it\r\nwas twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow\r\nof truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly\r\ninadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in\r\nhis death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just\r\nwhen his various different political arrangements were nearing\r\ncompletion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having\r\nneglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold\r\nresulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his\r\nroom till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a\r\nfortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find\r\nthe job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted\r\nwith his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his\r\nwhereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order\r\neven prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and\r\nStewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within\r\nthe bounds of possibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as\r\na born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure,\r\na sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged\r\nfeet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even a patch on\r\nthe former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were\r\nvery few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with\r\nfeet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on\r\nhim with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You\r\nhad to come back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the\r\nunderstudy in the title _r\xc3\xb4le_ how to. He saw him once on the\r\nauspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_\r\nor was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in\r\npoint of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he\r\nsaid _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid\r\nexterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the\r\ncup and the lip: what\xe2\x80\x99s bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You\r\nwere a lucky dog if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t set the terrier at you directly you got\r\nback. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and\r\nHarry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in\r\npossession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the\r\nTichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat\xe2\x80\x99s name to\r\nthe best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence\r\nwent to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew\r\nwas it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some\r\npal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description\r\ngiven, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or\r\nsome such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to\r\nthe not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under\r\ndiscussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor\r\ncommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry\r\nCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man\xe2\x80\x99s thighs.\r\nI seen her picture in a barber\xe2\x80\x99s. The husband was a captain or an\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.\r\n\r\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair\r\namount of laughter among his _entourage_. As regards Bloom he, without\r\nthe faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the\r\ndoor and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused\r\nextraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters\r\nworse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed\r\nbetween them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic\r\ntill nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till\r\nbit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of\r\nthe town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not\r\na few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his\r\ndownfall though the thing was public property all along though not to\r\nanything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed\r\ninto. Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared\r\nfavourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the\r\nrank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared\r\nher bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went\r\nthrough the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape\r\nof witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a\r\nparticular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment\r\nwith the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained\r\nadmittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the\r\nlubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the\r\nsimple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not\r\nbeing up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the\r\nname, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of\r\nweakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home\r\nties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one\xe2\x80\x99s smiles. The eternal\r\nquestion of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real\r\nlove, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist\r\nbetween married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of theirs\r\nabsolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of\r\nfolly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented\r\nobviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military\r\nsupernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my\r\ngallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th\r\nhussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,\r\nthat is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,\r\nwoman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame\r\nwhich he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the\r\ngospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved\r\nevicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts\r\nof the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that\r\nexceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his\r\nmatrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in\r\nthe same way as the fabled ass\xe2\x80\x99s kick. Looking back now in a\r\nretrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then\r\ncoming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without\r\nsaying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the\r\ntimes. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not\r\nbeen in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as\r\nit happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south,\r\nhowever, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and\r\nsimple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the\r\nvery thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting\r\nevery shred of decency to the winds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to\r\nStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t greatly mistake she\r\nwas Spanish too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The king of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or\r\nother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and\r\nthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and\r\nso many.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any\r\nmeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it\r\nwas as she lived there. So, Spain.\r\n\r\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him\r\nby the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out\r\nhis pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained\r\nrapidly finally he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded\r\nphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\r\n\r\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large\r\nsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she\r\nwas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously\r\nlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than\r\nvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,\r\nstanding near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which\r\nwas _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all\r\nthe vogue. Her (the lady\xe2\x80\x99s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about\r\nto smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland\r\nstreet, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the\r\nesthetic execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom\r\nindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like\r\nher then.\r\n\r\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his\r\nlegal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major\r\nBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a\r\nsinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered\r\nbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in\r\nexpression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a\r\nlot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage\r\nin that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for\r\nthe ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt,\r\nbeing a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in\r\ngeneral developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that\r\nafternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as\r\nworks of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original,\r\nshoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it\r\ndoes though, Saint Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne\r\ntoi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t art in a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to\r\nspeak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the\r\nbeauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in\r\nitself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was\r\nscarcely professional etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort\r\nof a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for\r\nsunshine after storm. And he did feel a kind of need there and then to\r\nfollow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by\r\nmoving a motion. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly\r\nsoiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear\r\nhowever, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further\r\nincreasing the other\xe2\x80\x99s possible embarrassment while gauging her\r\nsymmetry of heaving _embonpoint_. In fact the slight soiling was only\r\nan added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new,\r\nmuch better in fact with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?\r\nI looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely\r\nas a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning\r\nlittered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses\r\n(_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately\r\nbeside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,\r\n_distingu\xc3\xa9_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of\r\nthe bunch though you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think he had it in him yet you would.\r\nBesides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it\r\nwas though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An\r\nawful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a\r\nlifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same\r\nold matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or\r\nthe newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about\r\nthe whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment\r\nsprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the\r\npublic eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy\r\nand compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they\r\nopenly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside\r\nhotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in\r\ndue course intimate. Then the decree _nisi_ and the King\xe2\x80\x99s proctor\r\ntries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made\r\nabsolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they\r\nlargely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they\r\nvery largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor\r\nwho filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, B,\r\nenjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin\xe2\x80\x99s uncrowned king in the\r\nflesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen\r\nleader\xe2\x80\x99s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when\r\nclothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader\xe2\x80\x99s) trusty henchmen to the\r\nnumber of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated\r\ninto the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United\r\nIreland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up\r\nthe typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of\r\nsome scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O\xe2\x80\x99Brienite\r\nscribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile\r\ntribune\xe2\x80\x99s private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man he\r\nwas still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with\r\nthat look of settled purpose which went a long way with the\r\nshillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that\r\ntheir idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which\r\nshe, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot\r\ntimes in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a\r\nnasty prod of some chap\xe2\x80\x99s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated\r\nlodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a\r\ngrave character. His hat (Parnell\xe2\x80\x99s) a silk one was inadvertently\r\nknocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who\r\npicked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to\r\nreturn it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity)\r\nwho panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat\r\nat the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the\r\ncountry he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos\r\nof the thing than anything else, what\xe2\x80\x99s bred in the bone instilled into\r\nhim in infancy at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s knee in the shape of knowing what good\r\nform was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and\r\nthanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in\r\na very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal\r\nprofession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the\r\ncourse of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after\r\nthe burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory\r\nafter the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes\r\nof the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing\r\nimmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\r\nwherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\r\nfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\r\nhusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter\r\nfrom the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the\r\ncrucial moment in a loving position locked in one another\xe2\x80\x99s arms,\r\ndrawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a\r\ndomestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord\r\nand master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not\r\nreceive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would\r\noverlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes\r\nthough possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as\r\nquite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a\r\nsceptical bias, believed and didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the smallest bones about\r\nsaying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging\r\naround on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the\r\nbest wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the\r\nsake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of\r\nwedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to\r\npress their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being\r\nthat her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_\r\nbetween still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty\r\nand younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine\r\ninfatuation proved up to the hilt.\r\n\r\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of\r\nbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\r\nwith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last\r\nhim his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day\r\ntake unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the\r\ninterim ladies\xe2\x80\x99 society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the\r\ngravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump\r\nStephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular\r\nlodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as\r\nto whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl\r\ncourtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to\r\ntheir names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of\r\ncomplimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers\xe2\x80\x99 ways and\r\nflowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some\r\nlandlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The\r\nqueer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who\r\nwas several years the other\xe2\x80\x99s senior or like his father but something\r\nsubstantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made\r\non unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty\r\nDumpty boiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94At what o\xe2\x80\x99clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired\r\nthough unwrinkled face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow\r\nFriday. Ah, you mean it\xe2\x80\x99s after twelve!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\r\n\r\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.\r\nThough they didn\xe2\x80\x99t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there\r\nsomehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the\r\none train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some\r\nscore of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to\r\nparliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in\r\nretrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a\r\nsneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the\r\nevicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely\r\nin people\xe2\x80\x99s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a\r\ncopper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all\r\nevents was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the\r\ntrend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his\r\nmistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted\r\nwith going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he\r\nat one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he\r\nstrongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion\r\nby our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s so that\r\nhe, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of\r\nmortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him\r\n(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics\r\nthemselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties\r\ninvariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\r\nand the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on\r\nfine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\r\n\r\nAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it\r\nwas, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was\r\na bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue\r\n(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash\r\naltogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed\r\nunknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or\r\nthe reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he\r\nvery distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the\r\nother hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount\r\nor Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which\r\nof the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved\r\nhim to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things\r\nconsidered. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or\r\nnot over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwhat you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried\r\nhim was he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,\r\nsupposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very\r\ngreat personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in\r\nhis way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up\r\nby concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of\r\nEpps\xe2\x80\x99s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two\r\nand overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands\r\nand as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast\r\namount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort\r\nwas kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the\r\ngrasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nappear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly\r\nbeloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger\xe2\x80\x99s bawdyhouse\r\nof retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would\r\nbe the best clue to that equivocal character\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts for a few\r\ndays to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids\xe2\x80\x99) with\r\nsixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to\r\nfreeze the marrow of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s bones and mauling their largesized\r\ncharms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment\r\nof large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for\r\nas to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as\r\nMr Algebra remarks _passim_. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over\r\nhis gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being\r\na jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what\r\nproperly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point\r\ntoo of tender Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they\r\nappeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts\r\nin the county Sligo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while\r\nprudently pocketing her photo, as it\xe2\x80\x99s rather stuffy here you just come\r\nhome with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the\r\nvicinity. You can\xe2\x80\x99t drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\njust pay this lot.\r\n\r\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain\r\nsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the\r\nkeeper of the shanty who didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of\r\nthat Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B\xe2\x80\x99s) busy brain,\r\neducation (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,\r\nup to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed\r\nwith hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian\r\nwith the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other\r\nthings, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from\r\nthe housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was\r\nwanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father\xe2\x80\x99s voice to\r\nbank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be\r\njust as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the\r\ndirection of that particular red herring just to.\r\n\r\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former\r\nviceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers\xe2\x80\x99 association\r\ndinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this\r\nthrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who\r\nappeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony\r\nMacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary\xe2\x80\x99s lodge or words to\r\nthat effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner\r\nput in, manifesting some natural impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\r\n\r\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles\r\nwhich he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk\r\nqueried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a\r\nbit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen\r\nportholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.\r\nSand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the\r\ndark, manner of speaking. _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my\r\nfavourite and _Red as a Rose is She._\r\n\r\nHereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,\r\nfound drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a\r\nhundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which\r\ntime (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied\r\nloosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched\r\nhim as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were\r\nsufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,\r\nthat is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first\r\nto rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first\r\nand foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for\r\nthe occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine\r\nhost as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were\r\nnot looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a\r\ngrand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four\r\ncoppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously\r\nspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him\r\nin unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well\r\nworth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, he counselled to close the _s\xc3\xa9ance_.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the\r\nshelter or shanty together and the _\xc3\xa9lite_ society of oilskin and\r\ncompany whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their\r\n_dolce far niente_. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and\r\nfagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of\r\nthe moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs\r\nupside down, on the tables in caf\xc3\xa9s. To which impromptu the\r\nneverfailing Bloom replied without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, saying\r\nstraight off:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To sweep the floor in the morning.\r\n\r\nSo saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same\r\ntime apologetic to get on his companion\xe2\x80\x99s right, a habit of his, by the\r\nbye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The\r\nnight air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit\r\nweak on his pins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a\r\nmoment. The only thing is to walk then you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel a different man.\r\nCome. It\xe2\x80\x99s not far. Lean on me.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s right and led him on\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange\r\nkind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and\r\nall that.\r\n\r\nAnyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the\r\nmunicipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and\r\npurposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming\r\nof fresh fields and pastures new. And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the\r\nanalogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the\r\npart of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the\r\ntime of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the\r\nselfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\r\n\r\nSo they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which\r\nBloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made\r\ntracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though\r\nconfessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to\r\nfollow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante\xe2\x80\x99s _Huguenots_,\r\nMeyerbeer\xe2\x80\x99s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s _Twelfth Mass_\r\nhe simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the\r\nacme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else\r\ninto a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the\r\ncatholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line\r\nsuch as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live\r\nthy protestant to be_. He also yielded to none in his admiration of\r\nRossini\xe2\x80\x99s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,\r\nin which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable\r\nsensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and\r\nputting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers\xe2\x80\x99 church\r\nin upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the\r\ndoors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather. There was the\r\nunanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it\r\nto say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was\r\na generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring\r\npreferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,\r\na gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface\r\nknowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And\r\ntalking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old\r\nfavourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel\xe2\x80\x99s air in _Martha,\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be\r\nmore accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from\r\nthe lips of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of\r\nthe number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.\r\nStephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t sing it but\r\nlaunched out into praises of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s songs, at least of in or\r\nabout that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near\r\nGerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an\r\ninstrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,\r\nwhom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded\r\nfamiliar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_\r\nand _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he\r\nsaid, in the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one\r\nTomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\r\n\r\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\r\nthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\r\nbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\r\nperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to\r\nsixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the\r\npolitical celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical\r\nnames, as a striking coincidence.\r\n\r\nBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,\r\nBloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsleeve gently, jocosely remarking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\r\n\r\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\r\nanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\r\nnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even\r\nflesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a\r\nblackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot\r\nforemost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with\r\nhis thoughts. But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a lump\r\nof sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared\r\nfor every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big nervous\r\nfoolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But\r\neven a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s, of the\r\nsame size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal\xe2\x80\x99s fault\r\nin particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the\r\ndesert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them\r\nall could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring\r\nthe bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of\r\nhis back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my\r\neagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field\r\noccupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s words while the\r\nship of the street was man\xc5\x93uvring and Stephen went on about the highly\r\ninteresting old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in\r\nmedias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\r\nacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\r\n\r\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,\r\nimage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\r\nblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after\r\nas he was perhaps not that way built.\r\n\r\nStill, supposing he had his father\xe2\x80\x99s gift as he more than suspected, it\r\nopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall\xe2\x80\x99s Irish\r\nindustries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has\r\nEnd_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows\r\ncome from. Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_\r\nabout the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,\r\nwhich boggled Bloom a bit:\r\n\r\n     Von der Sirenen Listigkeit\r\n     Tun die Poeten dichten.\r\n\r\nThese opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. Bloom, nodding,\r\nsaid he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\r\nwhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could\r\neasily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice\r\nproduction such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the\r\nbargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and\r\nprocure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entr\xc3\xa9e_ into\r\nfashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial\r\nmagnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his\r\nuniversity degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly\r\nbearing to all the more influence the good impression he would\r\ninfallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which\r\nalso could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his\r\nclothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into\r\ntheir good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society\xe2\x80\x99s sartorial\r\nniceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate\r\nagainst you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily\r\nforesee him participating in their musical and artistic\r\n_conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for\r\nchoice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and\r\nbeing made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he\r\nhappened to know, were on record\xe2\x80\x94in fact, without giving the show away,\r\nhe himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added\r\nto which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be\r\nsneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he\r\nparenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily\r\nembrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of\r\ntime. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and\r\nboth monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity\r\nin the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a\r\ncheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though\r\ntaste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,\r\ndifferent from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue\r\nas it would be a decided novelty for Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s musical world after the\r\nusual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public\r\nby Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_. Yes,\r\nbeyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and\r\nhe had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high\r\nplace in the city\xe2\x80\x99s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and,\r\nbooking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street\r\nhouse, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs,\r\nso to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort\r\nto obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too\r\nmuch f\xc3\xaated prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the\r\nother by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time\r\nto practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing\r\nwithout its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything\r\nderogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he\r\nhad the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other,\r\npossessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort,\r\nhung on to him at all.\r\n\r\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he\r\npurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on\r\nthe _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his\r\nconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was\r\nprone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious\r\npretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call\r\nit which in Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side\r\nof a person\xe2\x80\x99s character, no pun intended.\r\n\r\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted\r\nand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting\r\nfall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three\r\nsmoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a\r\nfull crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she)\r\nhad ended, patient in his scythed car.\r\n\r\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed\r\nthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping\r\nover a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,\r\nStephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\r\n\r\n     Und alle Schiffe br\xc3\xbccken.\r\n\r\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\r\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,\r\none full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by\r\nFather Maher_. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again\r\ncontinuing their _t\xc3\xaate \xc3\xa0 t\xc3\xaate_ (which, of course, he was utterly out\r\nof) about sirens, enemies of man\xe2\x80\x99s reason, mingled with a number of\r\nother topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the\r\nkind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in\r\nthe sleeper car who in any case couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly hear because they\r\nwere too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner\r\nstreet _and looked after their lowbacked car_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 17 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?\r\n\r\nStarting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they\r\nfollowed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and\r\nMountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,\r\nGardiner\xe2\x80\x99s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of\r\nTemple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt,\r\nbearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.\r\nApproaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the\r\ncircus before George\xe2\x80\x99s church diametrically, the chord in any circle\r\nbeing less than the arc which it subtends.\r\n\r\nOf what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?\r\n\r\nMusic, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,\r\nprostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and\r\nglowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed\r\ncorporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,\r\necclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,\r\nthe study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the\r\npresabbath, Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.\r\n\r\nDid Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their\r\nrespective like and unlike reactions to experience?\r\n\r\nBoth were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to\r\nplastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner\r\nof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both\r\nindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of\r\nheterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox\r\nreligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the\r\nalternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual\r\nmagnetism.\r\n\r\nWere their views on some points divergent?\r\n\r\nStephen dissented openly from Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s views on the importance of\r\ndietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nviews on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.\r\nBloom assented covertly to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s rectification of the anachronism\r\ninvolved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to\r\nchristianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,\r\nson of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign\r\nof Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt\r\n(\xe2\x80\xa0 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty\r\nand interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric\r\ninanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of\r\nadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and\r\nthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen\r\nattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both\r\nfrom two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first\r\nno bigger than a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nWas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\r\n\r\nThe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining\r\nparaheliotropic trees.\r\n\r\nHad Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in\r\nthe past?\r\n\r\nIn 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public\r\nthoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s corner and\r\nLeonard\xe2\x80\x99s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield\r\navenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the\r\nwall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of\r\nUppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and\r\nprospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class\r\nrailway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major\r\nBrian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and\r\nseparately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s house in Roundtown. Once\r\nin 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both\r\noccasions in the parlour of his (Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s) house in Lombard street,\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nWhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,\r\n1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at\r\ntheir destination?\r\n\r\nHe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual\r\ndevelopment and experience was regressively accompanied by a\r\nrestriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.\r\n\r\nAs in what ways?\r\n\r\nFrom inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:\r\nexistence with existence he was with any as any with any: from\r\nexistence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.\r\n\r\nWhat act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?\r\n\r\nAt the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers,\r\nnumber 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back\r\npocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\r\n\r\nWas it there?\r\n\r\nIt was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on\r\nthe day but one preceding.\r\n\r\nWhy was he doubly irritated?\r\n\r\nBecause he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded\r\nhimself twice not to forget.\r\n\r\nWhat were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly\r\n(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?\r\n\r\nTo enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.\r\n\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s decision?\r\n\r\nA stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the\r\narea railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at\r\nthe lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its\r\nlength of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten\r\ninches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in\r\nspace by separating himself from the railings and crouching in\r\npreparation for the impact of the fall.\r\n\r\nDid he fall?\r\n\r\nBy his body\xe2\x80\x99s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in\r\navoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for\r\nperiodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,\r\npharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast\r\nof the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year\r\none thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era\r\nfive thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand\r\nthree hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,\r\ndominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.\r\n\r\nDid he rise uninjured by concussion?\r\n\r\nRegaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by\r\nthe impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force\r\nat its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied\r\nat its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the\r\nsubadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free\r\ninflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame\r\nwhich, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit\r\nfinally a portable candle.\r\n\r\nWhat discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?\r\n\r\nReclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent\r\nkitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a\r\ncandle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man\r\nleaving the kitchen holding a candle.\r\n\r\nDid the man reappear elsewhere?\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible\r\nthrough the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the\r\nhalldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open\r\nspace of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nDid Stephen obey his sign?\r\n\r\nYes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and\r\nfollowed softly along the hallway the man\xe2\x80\x99s back and listed feet and\r\nlighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and\r\ncarefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the\r\nkitchen of Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom do?\r\n\r\nHe extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its\r\nflame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for\r\nStephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when\r\nnecessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid\r\nresintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons\r\nof best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs\r\nFlower and M\xe2\x80\x99Donald of 14 D\xe2\x80\x99Olier street, kindled it at three\r\nprojecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby\r\nreleasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its\r\ncarbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nOf what similar apparitions did Stephen think?\r\n\r\nOf others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,\r\nhad kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the\r\ncollege of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the\r\ncounty of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room\r\nof his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of\r\nhis godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss\r\nJulia Morkan at 15 Usher\xe2\x80\x99s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie\r\n(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil\r\nstreet: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of\r\nnumber twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of\r\nSaint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the\r\nphysics\xe2\x80\x99 theatre of university College, 16 Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green, north: of\r\nhis sister Dilly (Delia) in his father\xe2\x80\x99s house in Cabra.\r\n\r\nWhat did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from\r\nthe fire towards the opposite wall?\r\n\r\nUnder a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,\r\nstretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the\r\nchimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs\r\nfolded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual\r\nposition clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer\r\nextremities and the third at their point of junction.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom see on the range?\r\n\r\nOn the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left\r\n(larger) hob a black iron kettle.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom do at the range?\r\n\r\nHe removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron\r\nkettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to\r\nlet it flow.\r\n\r\nDid it flow?\r\n\r\nYes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of\r\n2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of\r\nfilter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial\r\nplant cost of \xc2\xa3 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen\r\nof the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a\r\ndistance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving\r\ntanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace\r\nbridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and\r\ndaily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the\r\nsill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and\r\nwaterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of\r\nthe waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for\r\npurposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of\r\nrecourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals\r\nas in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding\r\ntheir ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch\r\nmeter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a\r\nreading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the\r\ncorporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the\r\ndetriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,\r\nsolvent, sound.\r\n\r\nWhat in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,\r\nreturning to the range, admire?\r\n\r\nIts universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature\r\nin seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprojection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the\r\nPacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and\r\nsurface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the\r\nindependence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its\r\nhydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and\r\nspring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the\r\ncircumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial\r\nsignificance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the\r\nglobe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all\r\nthe region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the\r\nmultisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its\r\ncapacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances\r\nincluding millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow\r\nerosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of\r\nhomothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its\r\nalluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its\r\nimperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of\r\ncolours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular\r\nramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent\r\noceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,\r\ngulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in\r\nseaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,\r\nfreshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,\r\ncataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:\r\nits vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs\r\nand latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric\r\ninstruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at\r\nAshtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of\r\nits composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent\r\npart of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the\r\nDead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,\r\ninadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,\r\nquenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as\r\nparadigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,\r\nsleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms\r\nin loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls\r\nand archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries\r\nand arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its\r\ndocility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric\r\npower stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in\r\ncanals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its\r\npotentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling\r\nfrom level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic,\r\nphotophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the\r\nglobe: its ubiquity as constituting 90\r\n% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine\r\n% marshes,\r\npestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nHaving set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he\r\nreturn to the stillflowing tap?\r\n\r\nTo wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of\r\nBarrington\xe2\x80\x99s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought\r\nthirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh\r\ncold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in\r\na long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.\r\n\r\nWhat reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s offer?\r\n\r\nThat he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by\r\nsubmersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the\r\nmonth of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous\r\nsubstances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWhat impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and\r\nprophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a\r\npreliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with\r\nrapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region\r\nin case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most\r\nsensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?\r\n\r\nThe incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.\r\n\r\nWhat additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?\r\n\r\nDietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric\r\nenergy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the\r\nlastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.\r\n\r\nWhich seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?\r\n\r\nConfidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and\r\nrecuperation.\r\n\r\nWhat concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the\r\nagency of fire?\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of\r\nventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was\r\ncommunicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral\r\nmasses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the\r\nfoliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn\r\nderived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat\r\n(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous\r\nether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion,\r\nwas constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of\r\ncalorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated\r\nthrough the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part\r\nreflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the\r\ntemperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in\r\ntemperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal\r\nunits needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50\xc2\xb0 to 212\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nWhat announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?\r\n\r\nA double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at\r\nboth sides simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFor what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?\r\n\r\nTo shave himself.\r\n\r\nWhat advantages attended shaving by night?\r\n\r\nA softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from\r\nshave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if\r\nunexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at\r\nincustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a\r\ncleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal\r\nnoises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a\r\npostman\xe2\x80\x99s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,\r\nrelathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he\r\nsought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving\r\nand a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected\r\nand applied adhered: which was to be done.\r\n\r\nWhy did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?\r\n\r\nBecause of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine\r\nfeminine passive active hand.\r\n\r\nWhat quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting\r\ninfluence?\r\n\r\nThe operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human\r\nblood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their\r\nnatural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nWhat lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the\r\nkitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?\r\n\r\nOn the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal\r\nbreakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a\r\nmoustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white\r\ngoldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly\r\ncopper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. On the middle shelf a\r\nchipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four\r\nconglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of\r\nPlumtree\xe2\x80\x99s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and\r\ncontaining one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and\r\nCo\xe2\x80\x99s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink\r\ntissue paper, a packet of Epps\xe2\x80\x99s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne\r\nLynch\xe2\x80\x99s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a\r\ncylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two\r\nonions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish,\r\nbisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model\r\nDairy\xe2\x80\x99s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a\r\nquarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water,\r\nacidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity\r\nsubtracted for Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s and Mrs Fleming\xe2\x80\x99s breakfasts, made one\r\nimperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a\r\nhalfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the\r\nupper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and\r\nproveniences.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?\r\n\r\nFour polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,\r\nnumbered 8 87, 88 6.\r\n\r\nWhat reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?\r\n\r\nReminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,\r\npreindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official\r\nand definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_,\r\nlate pink edition, in the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, at Butt bridge.\r\n\r\nWhere had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,\r\nbeen received by him?\r\n\r\nIn Bernard Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain\r\nstreet: in David Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon\xe2\x80\x99s when a dark man had\r\nplaced in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising\r\nElijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the\r\npremises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when,\r\nwhen Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively\r\nrequested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the\r\n_Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to\r\nthrow away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the\r\noriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street,\r\nwith the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in\r\nhis arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\r\n\r\nWhat qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event\r\nfollowed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the\r\nelectrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by\r\nfailure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding\r\noriginally from a successful interpretation.\r\n\r\nHis mood?\r\n\r\nHe had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he\r\nwas satisfied.\r\n\r\nWhat satisfied him?\r\n\r\nTo have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to\r\nothers. Light to the gentiles.\r\n\r\nHow did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?\r\n\r\nHe poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed\r\non the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the\r\nprescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\nWhat supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his\r\nguest?\r\n\r\nRelinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation\r\nCrown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),\r\nhe substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served\r\nextraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the\r\nviscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion\r\n(Molly).\r\n\r\nWas the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of\r\nhospitality?\r\n\r\nHis attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he\r\naccepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmassproduct, the creature cocoa.\r\n\r\nWere there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,\r\nreserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to\r\ncomplete the act begun?\r\n\r\nThe reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right\r\nside of his guest\xe2\x80\x99s jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWho drank more quickly?\r\n\r\nBloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and\r\ntaking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a\r\nsteady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s one,\r\nsix to two, nine to three.\r\n\r\nWhat cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?\r\n\r\nConcluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was\r\nengaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived\r\nfrom literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself\r\nhad applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the\r\nsolution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.\r\n\r\nHad he found their solution?\r\n\r\nIn spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,\r\naided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,\r\nthe answers not bearing in all points.\r\n\r\nWhat lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,\r\npotential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the\r\noffering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for\r\ncompetition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?\r\n\r\n     An ambition to squint\r\n     At my verses in print\r\n     Makes me hope that for these you\xe2\x80\x99ll find room.\r\n     If you so condescend\r\n     Then please place at the end\r\n     The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.\r\n\r\nDid he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?\r\n\r\nName, age, race, creed.\r\n\r\nWhat anagrams had he made on his name in youth?\r\n\r\nLeopold Bloom\r\nEllpodbomool\r\nMolldopeloob\r\nBollopedoom\r\nOld Ollebo, M. P.\r\n\r\nWhat acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic\r\npoet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?\r\n\r\n     Poets oft have sung in rhyme\r\n     Of music sweet their praise divine.\r\n     Let them hymn it nine times nine.\r\n     Dearer far than song or wine.\r\n     You are mine. The world is mine.\r\n\r\nWhat had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.\r\nJohnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,\r\nentitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_,\r\ncommissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,\r\n49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the\r\nvalley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the\r\ngrand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.\r\nShelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by\r\nGeorge A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan\r\nunder the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie\r\nNoir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist,\r\nprincipal girl?\r\n\r\nFirstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,\r\nthe anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded\r\n1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:\r\nsecondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the\r\nquestions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke\r\nand duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru\r\n(imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and\r\nprofessional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand\r\nLyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:\r\nfourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnon-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance\r\nand concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist\xe2\x80\x99s revelations of white\r\narticles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing\r\nwhile she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the\r\ndifficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous\r\nallusions from _Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in\r\nevery one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,\r\nassociated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new\r\nhigh sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket\r\nBarton.\r\n\r\nWhat relation existed between their ages?\r\n\r\n16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s present age Stephen\r\nwas 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\nage Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54\r\ntheir ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13\r\n1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according\r\nas arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in\r\n1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then\r\n1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen\r\nwould be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when\r\nStephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,\r\nbeing 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have\r\nsurpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of\r\nMethusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until\r\nhe would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been\r\nobliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have\r\nbeen born in the year 81,396 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhat events might nullify these calculations?\r\n\r\nThe cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new\r\nera or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent\r\nextermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.\r\n\r\nHow many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?\r\n\r\nTwo. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s house, Medina\r\nVilla, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his\r\nhand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin\xe2\x80\x99s hotel on\r\na rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather and Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.\r\n\r\nDid Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and\r\nafterwards seconded by the father?\r\n\r\nVery gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative\r\ngratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.\r\n\r\nDid their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a\r\nthird connecting link between them?\r\n\r\nMrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the\r\nhouse of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891\r\nand had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City\r\nArms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during\r\nparts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of\r\nBloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in\r\nthe employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence\r\nof sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nHad he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?\r\n\r\nHe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow\r\nof independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with\r\nslow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North\r\nCircular road opposite Mr Gavin Low\xe2\x80\x99s place of business where she had\r\nremained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular\r\nfieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles\r\nequipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,\r\nprivate and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from\r\nthe city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nWhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?\r\n\r\nBecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of\r\nbossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with\r\ncontinual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,\r\nvelocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round\r\nand round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.\r\n\r\nWhat distinct different memories had each of her now eight years\r\ndeceased?\r\n\r\nThe older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her\r\nsuppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient\r\ncatarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the\r\nstatue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.\r\n\r\nWere there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation\r\nwhich these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the\r\nmore desirable?\r\n\r\nThe indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently\r\nabandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow\xe2\x80\x99s _Physical Strength and How to\r\nObtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in\r\nsedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in\r\nfront of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of\r\nmuscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant\r\nrelaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.\r\n\r\nHad any special agility been his in earlier youth?\r\n\r\nThough ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full\r\ncircle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had\r\nexcelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever\r\nmovement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally\r\ndeveloped abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nDid either openly allude to their racial difference?\r\n\r\nNeither.\r\n\r\nWhat, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\nabout Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about Stephen?\r\n\r\nHe thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he\r\nknew that he knew that he was not.\r\n\r\nWhat, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective\r\nparentages?\r\n\r\nBloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag\r\n(subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan,\r\nLondon and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius\r\nHiggins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest\r\nsurviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin\r\nand of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).\r\n\r\nHad Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or\r\nlayman?\r\n\r\nBloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone,\r\nin the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump\r\nin the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in\r\nthe church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the\r\nreverend Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three\r\nPatrons, Rathgar.\r\n\r\nDid they find their educational careers similar?\r\n\r\nSubstituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively\r\nthrough a dame\xe2\x80\x99s school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for\r\nStephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,\r\njunior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the\r\nmatriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the\r\nroyal university.\r\n\r\nWhy did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the\r\nuniversity of life?\r\n\r\nBecause of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation\r\nhad or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhat two temperaments did they individually represent?\r\n\r\nThe scientific. The artistic.\r\n\r\nWhat proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards\r\napplied, rather than towards pure, science?\r\n\r\nCertain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in\r\na state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his\r\nappreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once\r\nrevolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting\r\ntelescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water\r\nsiphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.\r\n\r\nWere these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of\r\nkindergarten?\r\n\r\nYes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,\r\ncatapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the\r\ntwelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature\r\nmechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to\r\ncorrespond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,\r\nhistorically costumed dolls.\r\n\r\nWhat also stimulated him in his cogitations?\r\n\r\nThe financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,\r\nthe former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George\xe2\x80\x99s street, south, the latter at\r\nhis 6 1/2d shop and world\xe2\x80\x99s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30\r\nHenry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities\r\nhitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in\r\ntriliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility\r\n(divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of\r\nmagnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to\r\nconvince, to decide.\r\n\r\nSuch as?\r\n\r\nK. 11.

Nannetti, M. P.,\r\nRotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and\r\nanniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A\r\nplumtree in a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations.\r\nPeatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat. Plamtroo.\r\n\r\nWhich example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that\r\noriginality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably\r\nconduce to success?\r\n\r\nHis own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn\r\nby a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be\r\nseated engaged in writing.\r\n\r\nWhat suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?\r\n\r\nSolitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark\r\ncorner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She\r\nsits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks.\r\nOn solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs.\r\nWheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He\r\nseizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads.\r\nSolitary.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nIn sloping, upright and backhands: Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel,\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel. Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Ho...\r\n\r\nWhat suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?\r\n\r\nThe Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf\r\nVirag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,\r\nin consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered\r\nin the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite\r\nliniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on\r\nthe morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17\r\nChurch street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of\r\nhaving, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new\r\nboater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence\r\nof having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin\r\naforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main\r\nstreet, Ennis.\r\n\r\nDid he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or\r\nintuition?\r\n\r\nCoincidence.\r\n\r\nDid he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?\r\n\r\nHe preferred himself to see another\xe2\x80\x99s face and listen to another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nDid he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to\r\nhim, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The\r\nParable of the Plums_?\r\n\r\nIt, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by\r\nimplication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms\r\n(e.g. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_)\r\ncomposed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in\r\nconjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of\r\nfinancial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially\r\ncollected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent\r\nmerit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or\r\ncontributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy\r\nor Doctor Dick or Heblon\xe2\x80\x99s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of\r\ncertified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual\r\nstimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of\r\nsuccessful narrative and confidently augurative of successful\r\nachievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following\r\nthe summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday,\r\n21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.\r\n\r\nWhich domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other\r\nfrequently engaged his mind?\r\n\r\nWhat to do with our wives.\r\n\r\nWhat had been his hypothetical singular solutions?\r\n\r\nParlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,\r\nnap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,\r\nchess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the\r\npoliceaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar,\r\npiano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope\r\naddressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial\r\nactivity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress\r\nproprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine\r\nsatisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state\r\ninspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular\r\ninfrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive\r\nsuperintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised\r\nrespectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction\r\nspecially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.\r\n\r\nWhat instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him\r\nin favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?\r\n\r\nIn disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper\r\nwith signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and\r\nHebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals\r\nas to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of\r\na city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political\r\ncomplications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating\r\nthe addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After\r\ncompletion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the\r\nimplement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the\r\ncorrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual\r\npolysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by\r\nfalse analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_\r\n(a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).\r\n\r\nWhat compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and\r\nsuch deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?\r\n\r\nThe false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all\r\nbalances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her\r\nproficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nHow had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?\r\n\r\nVariously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a\r\ncertain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent\r\nknowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nignorant lapse.\r\n\r\nWith what success had he attempted direct instruction?\r\n\r\nShe followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest\r\ncomprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty\r\nremembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated\r\nwith error.\r\n\r\nWhat system had proved more effective?\r\n\r\nIndirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.\r\n\r\nExample?\r\n\r\nShe disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she\r\ndisliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new\r\nhat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.\r\n\r\nAccepting the analogy implied in his guest\xe2\x80\x99s parable which examples of\r\npostexilic eminence did he adduce?\r\n\r\nThree seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,\r\nauthor of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn\r\nof such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn)\r\nthere arose none like Moses (Maimonides).\r\n\r\nWhat statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth\r\nseeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by\r\nStephen?\r\n\r\nThat the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,\r\nname uncertain.\r\n\r\nWere other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a\r\nselected or rejected race mentioned?\r\n\r\nFelix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),\r\nMendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).\r\n\r\nWhat fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish\r\nlanguages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts\r\nby guest to host and by host to guest?\r\n\r\nBy Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_\r\n(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).\r\n\r\nBy Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m\xe2\x80\x99baad l\xe2\x80\x99zamatejch_ (thy temple\r\namid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).\r\n\r\nHow was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages\r\nmade in substantiation of the oral comparison?\r\n\r\nBy juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior\r\nliterary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so\r\nmanipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of\r\nthe table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish\r\ncharacters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn\r\nwrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence\r\nof mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as\r\nordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.\r\n\r\nWas the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the\r\nextinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?\r\n\r\nTheoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence\r\nand syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.\r\n\r\nWhat points of contact existed between these languages and between the\r\npeoples who spoke them?\r\n\r\nThe presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and\r\nservile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been\r\ntaught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the\r\nseminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor\r\nof Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland:\r\ntheir archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical,\r\nhomiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures\r\ncomprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and\r\nGhemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote,\r\nGarland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival\r\nand revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical\r\nrites in ghetto (S. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and\r\njewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the\r\npossibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.\r\n\r\nWhat anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,\r\nethnically irreducible consummation?\r\n\r\n     Kolod balejwaw pnimah\r\n     Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.\r\n\r\nWhy was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?\r\n\r\nIn consequence of defective mnemotechnic.\r\n\r\nHow did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?\r\n\r\nBy a periphrastic version of the general text.\r\n\r\nIn what common study did their mutual reflections merge?\r\n\r\nThe increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic\r\nhieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of\r\nmodern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions\r\n(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).\r\n\r\nDid the guest comply with his host\xe2\x80\x99s request?\r\n\r\nDoubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.\r\n\r\nWhat was Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s auditive sensation?\r\n\r\nHe heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nWhat was Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s visual sensation?\r\n\r\nHe saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhat were Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s and Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s quasisimultaneous volitional\r\nquasisensations of concealed identities?\r\n\r\nVisually, Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by\r\nJohannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as\r\nleucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.\r\n\r\nAuditively, Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nWhat future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with\r\nwhat exemplars?\r\n\r\nIn the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very\r\nreverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of\r\nTrinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:\r\nexemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage,\r\nmodern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian,\r\nOsmond Tearle (\xe2\x80\xa0 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nDid the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a\r\nstrange legend on an allied theme?\r\n\r\nReassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being\r\nsecluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid\r\nresidual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream\r\nplus cocoa, having been consumed.\r\n\r\nRecite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.\r\n\r\n     Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all\r\n     Went out for to play ball.\r\n     And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played\r\n     He drove it o\xe2\x80\x99er the jew\xe2\x80\x99s garden wall.\r\n     And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played\r\n     He broke the jew\xe2\x80\x99s windows all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?\r\n\r\nWith unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw\r\nthe unbroken kitchen window.\r\n\r\nRecite the second part (minor) of the legend.\r\n\r\n     Then out there came the jew\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\n     And she all dressed in green.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCome back, come back, you pretty little boy,\r\n     And play your ball again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n     \r\n     I can\xe2\x80\x99t come back and I won\xe2\x80\x99t come back\r\n     Without my schoolfellows all.\r\n     For if my master he did hear\r\n     He\xe2\x80\x99d make it a sorry ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     She took him by the lilywhite hand\r\n     And led him along the hall\r\n     Until she led him to a room\r\n     Where none could hear him call.\r\n\r\n     She took a penknife out of her pocket\r\n     And cut off his little head.\r\n     And now he\xe2\x80\x99ll play his ball no more\r\n     For he lies among the dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow did the father of Millicent receive this second part?\r\n\r\nWith mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, all dressed in green.\r\n\r\nCondense Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s commentary.\r\n\r\nOne of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by\r\ninadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when\r\nhe is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of\r\nhope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange\r\nhabitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable,\r\nimmolates him, consenting.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?\r\n\r\nHe wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him\r\nshould by him not be told.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (secret infidel) silent?\r\n\r\nHe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the\r\nincitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the\r\npropagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of\r\nopulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of\r\natavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,\r\nhypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\r\n\r\nFrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not\r\ntotally immune?\r\n\r\nFrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his\r\nsleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an\r\nindefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From\r\nsomnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled\r\nin the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its\r\ndestination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nHad this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member\r\nof his family?\r\n\r\nTwice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent\r\n(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an\r\nexclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two\r\nfigures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.\r\n\r\nWhat other infantile memories had he of her?\r\n\r\n15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and\r\nlessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks\r\nher moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,\r\ntlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,\r\nshe had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,\r\nAustrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nWhat endemic characteristics were present?\r\n\r\nConversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line\r\nof lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant\r\nintervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.\r\n\r\nWhat memories had he of her adolescence?\r\n\r\nShe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to\r\nmake and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On\r\nthe South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an\r\nindividual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and\r\nturned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the\r\n15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county\r\nWestmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year\r\nnot stated).\r\n\r\nDid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?\r\n\r\nLess than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.\r\n\r\nWhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,\r\nif differently?\r\n\r\nA temporary departure of his cat.\r\n\r\nWhy similarly, why differently?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male\r\n(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,\r\nbecause of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nIn other respects were their differences similar?\r\n\r\nIn passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in\r\nunexpectedness.\r\n\r\nAs?\r\n\r\nInasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it\r\nfor her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake\r\nin Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented\r\nspit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the\r\nconstancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf\r\nmousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,\r\nissue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a\r\nplait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she\r\ndreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a\r\nhorse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a\r\ntumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf\r\nhearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct\r\nof tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.\r\n\r\nIn what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as\r\nmatrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?\r\n\r\nAs object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous\r\nanimals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of\r\nvision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the\r\npendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation\r\nin terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of\r\nclockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of\r\nthe recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and\r\nthe shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,\r\n_videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical\r\nprogression.\r\n\r\nIn what manners did she reciprocate?\r\n\r\nShe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to\r\nhim a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.\r\nShe provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had\r\nbeen made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his\r\nnecessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural\r\nphenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the\r\nimmediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of\r\nhis science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.\r\n\r\nWhat proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist,\r\nmake to Stephen, noctambulist?\r\n\r\nTo pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and\r\nFriday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately\r\nabove the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of\r\nhis host and hostess.\r\n\r\nWhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a\r\nprolongation of such an extemporisation?\r\n\r\nFor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the\r\nhost: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the\r\nhostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\nWhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a\r\nhostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent\r\neventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter?\r\n\r\nBecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother\r\nthrough daughter.\r\n\r\nTo what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest\r\nreturn a monosyllabic negative answer?\r\n\r\nIf he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at\r\nSydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.\r\n\r\nWhat inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the\r\nhost?\r\n\r\nA statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment\r\nof Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the\r\nanniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).\r\n\r\nWas the proposal of asylum accepted?\r\n\r\nPromptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.\r\n\r\nWhat exchange of money took place between host and guest?\r\n\r\nThe former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (\xc2\xa3\r\n1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nWhat counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,\r\ndeclined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?\r\n\r\nTo inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the\r\nresidence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal\r\ninstruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a\r\nseries of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,\r\nplaces the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident\r\nin the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street\r\n(W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10\r\nKildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles\r\nstreet, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a\r\nconjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection\r\nof a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were\r\nresident in different places).\r\n\r\nWhat rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually\r\nselfexcluding propositions?\r\n\r\nThe irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert\r\nHengler\xe2\x80\x99s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive\r\nparticoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring\r\nto a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had\r\npublicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his\r\n(the clown\xe2\x80\x99s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the\r\nsummer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches\r\non the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and\r\nreceived by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand\r\nCanal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,\r\ncircuitous or direct, return.\r\n\r\nWas the clown Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s son?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHad Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s coin returned?\r\n\r\nNever.\r\n\r\nWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?\r\n\r\nBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to\r\namend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and\r\ninternational animosity.\r\n\r\nHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible,\r\neliminating these conditions?\r\n\r\nThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct\r\nfrom human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of\r\ndestruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of\r\nthe ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and\r\ndeath: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human\r\nfemales extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable\r\naccidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies\r\nand their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital\r\ncriminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make\r\nterror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres\r\nof which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital\r\ngrowth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through\r\nmaturity to decay.\r\n\r\nWhy did he desist from speculation?\r\n\r\nBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other\r\nmore acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena\r\nto be removed.\r\n\r\nDid Stephen participate in his dejection?\r\n\r\nHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding\r\nsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational\r\nreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon\r\nthe incertitude of the void.\r\n\r\nWas this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?\r\n\r\nNot verbally. Substantially.\r\n\r\nWhat comforted his misapprehension?\r\n\r\nThat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from\r\nthe unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\r\n\r\nIn what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the\r\nexodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation\r\neffected?\r\n\r\nLighted Candle in Stick borne by\r\nBLOOM\r\nDiaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by\r\nSTEPHEN\r\n\r\nWith what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?\r\n\r\nThe 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra\xc3\xabl de Egypto: domus Jacob de\r\npopulo barbaro_.\r\n\r\nWhat did each do at the door of egress?\r\n\r\nBloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nFor what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?\r\n\r\nFor a cat.\r\n\r\nWhat spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the\r\nguest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from\r\nthe rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?\r\n\r\nThe heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.\r\n\r\nWith what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his\r\ncompanion of various constellations?\r\n\r\nMeditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in\r\nincipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous\r\nscintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an\r\nobserver placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000\r\nft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of\r\nSirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles)\r\ndistant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of\r\nArcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and\r\nsextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could\r\nbe contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in\r\n1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of\r\nthe parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality\r\nevermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote\r\nfutures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of\r\nallotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.\r\n\r\nWere there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?\r\n\r\nOf the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of\r\nthe earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences\r\nconcealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives\r\nand mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the\r\nincalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible\r\nmolecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single\r\npinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white\r\nbodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other\r\nbodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies\r\nof which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component\r\nbodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division\r\ntill, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?\r\n\r\nBecause some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of\r\nthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a\r\nnumber computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such\r\nmagnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power\r\nof 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes\r\nof 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would\r\nhave to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its\r\nprinted integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of\r\nthousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds\r\nof millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of\r\nevery series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to\r\nthe utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.\r\n\r\nDid he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their\r\nsatellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and\r\nmoral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?\r\n\r\nOf a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,\r\nnormally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when\r\nelevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere\r\nsuffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the\r\nline of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was\r\napproximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,\r\nwhen proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a\r\nworking hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more\r\nadaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might\r\nsubsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,\r\nNeptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an\r\napogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite\r\ndifferences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would\r\nprobably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to\r\nvanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.\r\n\r\nAnd the problem of possible redemption?\r\n\r\nThe minor was proved by the major.\r\n\r\nWhich various features of the constellations were in turn considered?\r\n\r\nThe various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,\r\nyellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:\r\ntheir magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:\r\nthe waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular\r\ncinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the\r\ninterdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous\r\ndiscoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,\r\nGalle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of\r\ndistances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite\r\ncompressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive\r\nand reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin\r\nof meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the\r\nbirth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric\r\nshowers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10\r\nAugust): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon\r\nin her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the\r\nappearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating\r\nby night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and\r\namalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the\r\nperiod of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent\r\nneversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude)\r\nof similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and\r\ndisappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about\r\nthe period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of\r\n(presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably)\r\nappeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about\r\nthe period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the\r\nconstellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph\r\nBloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before\r\nor after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena\r\nof eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of\r\nwind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of\r\nnocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,\r\nobscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.\r\n\r\nHis (Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and\r\nallowing for possible error?\r\n\r\nThat it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not\r\na heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the\r\nknown to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the\r\nsuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and\r\nof different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in\r\nspace, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as\r\na present before its probable spectators had entered actual present\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?\r\n\r\nIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the\r\ndelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection\r\ninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the\r\nsatellite of their planet.\r\n\r\nDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological\r\ninfluences upon sublunary disasters?\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the\r\nnomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to\r\nverifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the\r\nsea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.\r\n\r\nWhat special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and\r\nwoman?\r\n\r\nHer antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian\r\ngenerations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her\r\nluminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and\r\nsetting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced\r\ninvariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to\r\ninaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent\r\nwaters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to\r\nrender insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil\r\ninscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant\r\nimplacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:\r\nthe stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the\r\nadmonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,\r\nwhen visible: her attraction, when invisible.\r\n\r\nWhat visible luminous sign attracted Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s, who attracted Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ngaze?\r\n\r\nIn the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s) house the light of a\r\nparaffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller\r\nblind supplied by Frank O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, window blind, curtain pole and\r\nrevolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.\r\n\r\nHow did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his\r\nwife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?\r\n\r\nWith indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued\r\naffection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nBoth then were silent?\r\n\r\nSilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal\r\nflesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.\r\n\r\nWere they indefinitely inactive?\r\n\r\nAt Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, at Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s instigation both, first Stephen,\r\nthen Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs\r\nof micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual\r\ncircumposition, their gazes, first Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s, then Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s, elevated to\r\nthe projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.\r\n\r\nSimilarly?\r\n\r\nThe trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations\r\nwere dissimilar: Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form\r\nof the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate\r\nyear at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of\r\ngreatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the\r\ninstitution, 210 scholars: Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s higher, more sibilant, who in the\r\nultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic\r\nconsumption an insistent vesical pressure.\r\n\r\nWhat different problems presented themselves to each concerning the\r\ninvisible audible collateral organ of the other?\r\n\r\nTo Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,\r\nreactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.\r\n\r\nTo Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus\r\ncircumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain\r\nfrom unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine\r\nprepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic\r\nchurch, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of\r\nthe fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine\r\nexcrescences as hair and toenails.\r\n\r\nWhat celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?\r\n\r\nA star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament\r\nfrom Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the\r\nTress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.\r\n\r\nHow did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal\r\ndeparter?\r\n\r\nBy inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an\r\nunstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and\r\nturning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its\r\nstaple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and\r\nrevealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.\r\n\r\nHow did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?\r\n\r\nStanding perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its\r\nbase, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and\r\nforming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.\r\n\r\nWhat sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of\r\ntheir (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?\r\n\r\nThe sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the\r\nbells in the church of Saint George.\r\n\r\nWhat echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\r\n\r\nBy Stephen:\r\n\r\n     Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.\r\n     Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.\r\n\r\nBy Bloom:\r\n\r\n     Heigho, heigho,\r\n     Heigho, heigho.\r\n\r\nWhere were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day\r\nat the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south\r\nto Glasnevin in the north?\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in\r\nbed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed),\r\nJohn Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in\r\nbed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).\r\n\r\nAlone, what did Bloom hear?\r\n\r\nThe double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth,\r\nthe double vibration of a jew\xe2\x80\x99s harp in the resonant lane.\r\n\r\nAlone, what did Bloom feel?\r\n\r\nThe cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing\r\npoint or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or R\xc3\xa9aumur: the\r\nincipient intimations of proximate dawn.\r\n\r\nOf what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nOf companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy\r\nApjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,\r\nJervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin\r\nBay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart\r\n(phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy,\r\nSandymount).\r\n\r\nWhat prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?\r\n\r\nThe disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the\r\napparition of a new solar disk.\r\n\r\nHad he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?\r\n\r\nOnce, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house\r\nof Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of\r\nthe diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the\r\ndirection of Mizrach, the east.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the initial paraphenomena?\r\n\r\nMore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at\r\nvarious points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,\r\nthe visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the\r\nfirst golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.\r\n\r\nDid he remain?\r\n\r\nWith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering\r\nthe passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed\r\nthe candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front\r\nroom, hallfloor, and reentered.\r\n\r\nWhat suddenly arrested his ingress?\r\n\r\nThe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into\r\ncontact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible\r\nfraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in\r\nconsequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.\r\n\r\nDescribe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nA sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite\r\nthe door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an\r\nalteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and\r\nwhite checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the\r\ndoor in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard\r\n(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had\r\nbeen moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but\r\nmore perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved\r\nfrom right and left of the ingleside to the position originally\r\noccupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.\r\n\r\nDescribe them.\r\n\r\nOne: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back\r\nslanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an\r\nirregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply\r\nupholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing\r\ndiscolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane\r\ncurves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat\r\nand from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a\r\nbright circle of white plaited rush.\r\n\r\nWhat significances attached to these two chairs?\r\n\r\nSignificances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of\r\ncircumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.\r\n\r\nWhat occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?\r\n\r\nA vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin\r\nsupporting a pair of long yellow ladies\xe2\x80\x99 gloves and an emerald ashtray\r\ncontaining four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two\r\ndiscoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in\r\nthe key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love\xe2\x80\x99s Old Sweet Song_\r\n(words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam\r\nAntoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications\r\n_ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_,\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nWith what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?\r\n\r\nWith strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right\r\ntemple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a\r\nlarge dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,\r\nbending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,\r\nremembering Dr Malachi Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s scheme of colour containing the\r\ngradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent\r\nact and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the\r\nconsequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual\r\ndiscolouration.\r\n\r\nHis next proceeding?\r\n\r\nFrom an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black\r\ndiminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on\r\na small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the\r\nmantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus\r\n(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it\r\nsuperficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the\r\ncandleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the\r\nlatter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin\r\nof the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to\r\nfacilitate total combustion.\r\n\r\nWhat followed this operation?\r\n\r\nThe truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a\r\nvertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.\r\n\r\nWhat homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the\r\nmantelpiece?\r\n\r\nA timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46\r\na.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf\r\ntree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial\r\ngift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of\r\nAlderman John Hooper.\r\n\r\nWhat interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and\r\nBloom?\r\n\r\nIn the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the\r\ndwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the\r\nmirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear\r\nmelancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom\r\nwhile Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated\r\ngaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.\r\n\r\nWhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his\r\nattention?\r\n\r\nThe image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.\r\n\r\nWhy solitary (ipsorelative)?\r\n\r\n     Brothers and sisters had he none.\r\n     Yet that man\xe2\x80\x99s father was his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\nWhy mutable (aliorelative)?\r\n\r\nFrom infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.\r\nFrom maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal\r\nprocreator.\r\n\r\nWhat final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?\r\n\r\nThe optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged\r\nand not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles\r\non the two bookshelves opposite.\r\n\r\nCatalogue these books.\r\n\r\n_Thom\xe2\x80\x99s Dublin Post Office Directory_, 1886.\r\n\r\nDenis Florence M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy\xe2\x80\x99s _Poetical Works_ (copper beechleaf bookmark\r\nat p. 5).\r\n\r\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s _Works_ (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled).\r\n\r\n_The Useful Ready Reckoner_ (brown cloth).\r\n\r\n_The Secret History of the Court of Charles II_ (red cloth, tooled\r\nbinding).\r\n\r\n_The Child\xe2\x80\x99s Guide_ (blue cloth).\r\n\r\n_The Beauties of Killarney_ (wrappers).\r\n\r\n_When We Were Boys_ by William O\xe2\x80\x99Brien M.

A. Wren, 9 Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Walk.\r\n\r\nWhat caused him irritation in his sitting posture?\r\n\r\nInhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two\r\narticles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and\r\ninelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.\r\n\r\nHow was the irritation allayed?\r\n\r\nHe removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible\r\nstud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He\r\nunbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers,\r\nshirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black\r\nhairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over\r\nthe circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the\r\nmedial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral\r\nvertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in\r\ncircles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the\r\nsummits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of\r\nsix minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nWhat involuntary actions followed?\r\n\r\nHe compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice\r\nin the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a\r\nsting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.\r\nHe scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of\r\nprurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly\r\nabluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of\r\nhis waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),\r\nplaced there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the\r\ninterment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.\r\n\r\nCompile the budget for 16 June 1904.\r\n\r\n     Debit\r\n                                        \xc2\xa3. s. d.\r\n     1 Pork kidney                      0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x943\r\n     1 Copy Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal           0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Bath and Gratification           0\xe2\x80\x941\xe2\x80\x946\r\n     Tramfare                           0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 In Memoriam Patrick Dignam       0\xe2\x80\x945\xe2\x80\x940\r\n     2 Banbury cakes                    0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Lunch                            0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x947\r\n     1 Renewal fee for book             0\xe2\x80\x941\xe2\x80\x940\r\n     1 Packet Notepaper and Envelopes   0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x942\r\n     1 Dinner and Gratification         0\xe2\x80\x942\xe2\x80\x940\r\n     1 Postal Order and Stamp           0\xe2\x80\x942\xe2\x80\x948\r\n     Tramfare                           0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Pig\xe2\x80\x99s Foot                       0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x944\r\n     1 Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Trotter                  0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x943\r\n     1 Cake Fry\xe2\x80\x99s Plain Chocolate       0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Square Soda Bread                0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x944\r\n     1 Coffee and Bun                   0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x944\r\n     Loan (Stephen Dedalus) refunded    1\xe2\x80\x947\xe2\x80\x940\r\n        BALANCE                         0\xe2\x80\x9416\xe2\x80\x946\r\n                                        \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n                                        2\xe2\x80\x9419\xe2\x80\x943\r\n     Credit\r\n                                        \xc2\xa3. s. d.\r\n     Cash in hand                       0\xe2\x80\x944\xe2\x80\x949\r\n     Commission recd.

of divestiture continue?\r\n\r\nSensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended\r\nhis foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and\r\nsalient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking\r\nrepeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded\r\nthe laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his\r\ntwo boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right\r\nsock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again\r\neffracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic\r\nsock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right\r\nfoot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently\r\nlacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part\r\nlacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then,\r\nwith satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.\r\n\r\nWhy with satisfaction?\r\n\r\nBecause the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other\r\nungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs\r\nEllis\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile

P., P. C.,\r\nK. P., L. L. D. (_honoris causa_), Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned\r\nin court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have\r\nleft Kingstown for England).\r\n\r\nWhat course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?\r\n\r\nA course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the\r\ndispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,\r\nincessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social\r\ninequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered\r\nwith mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the\r\nuttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to\r\nthe crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated\r\nby an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance\r\nof public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all\r\nsimultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a\r\npreliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution),\r\nthe upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law\r\nmerchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in\r\ncontravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass\r\nand petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by\r\ndesuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all\r\nperpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of\r\ndomestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic\r\nconnubiality.\r\n\r\nProve that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.\r\n\r\nTo Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his\r\ndisbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his\r\nfather Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the\r\nIsraelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting\r\nChristianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of\r\nRoman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in\r\n1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile\r\nfriendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he\r\nhad advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of\r\ncolonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of\r\nCharles Darwin, expounded in _The Descent of Man_ and _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the\r\ncollective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan\r\nLalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien and others,\r\nthe agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of\r\nCharles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace,\r\nretrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for\r\nMidlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had\r\nclimbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on\r\nNorthumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the\r\ncapital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000\r\ntorchbearers, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches\r\nin escort of the marquess of Ripon and (honest) John Morley.\r\n\r\nHow much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?\r\n\r\nAs per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised\r\nFriendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of\r\n\xc2\xa3 60 per annum, being 1/6 of an assured income, derived from giltedged\r\nsecurities, representing at 5 % simple interest on capital of \xc2\xa3 1200\r\n(estimate of price at 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 purchase), of which 1/3 to be paid on\r\nacquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. \xc2\xa3 800 plus\r\n2 1/2 % interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual\r\ninstalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for\r\npurchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of\r\n\xc2\xa3 64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the\r\nlender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale,\r\nforeclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure\r\nto pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the\r\nabsolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of\r\nyears stipulated.\r\n\r\nWhat rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate\r\npurchase?\r\n\r\nA private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash\r\nsystem the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase)\r\nof 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1\r\nat 3 hr 8 m p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time), the message being received\r\nand available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink\r\ntime).

A\r\nSpanish prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s donation of a distant treasure of valuables or\r\nspecie or bullion lodged with a solvent banking corporation 100 years\r\npreviously at 5% compound interest of the collective worth of \xc2\xa3\r\n5,000,000 stg (five million pounds sterling).

(mixed\r\nanimal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035, the total\r\npopulation of Ireland according to census returns of 1901.\r\n\r\nWere there schemes of wider scope?\r\n\r\nA scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour\r\ncommissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power),\r\nobtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at\r\nhead of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main\r\nstreams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity.\r\nA scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at\r\nDollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links\r\nand rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting\r\ngalleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for\r\nmixed bathing. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the\r\ndelivery of early morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish\r\ntourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled\r\nriverboats, plying in the fluvial fairway between Island bridge and\r\nRingsend, charabancs, narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure\r\nsteamers for coastwise navigation (10/- per person per day, guide\r\n(trilingual) included). A scheme for the repristination of passenger\r\nand goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed from weedbeds. A\r\nscheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market (North Circular road\r\nand Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff street, lower, and East\r\nWall), parallel with the Link line railway laid (in conjunction with\r\nthe Great Southern and Western railway line) between the cattle park,\r\nLiffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western Railway 43 to 45\r\nNorth Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of\r\nGreat Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam\r\nPacket Company, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and\r\nGlasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow, Dublin and Londonderry Steam\r\nPacket Company (Laird line), British and Irish Steam Packet Company,\r\nDublin and Morecambe Steamers, London and North Western Railway\r\nCompany, Dublin Port and Docks Board Landing Sheds and transit sheds of\r\nPalgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers\r\nfrom Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and\r\nfor Liverpool Underwriters\xe2\x80\x99 Association, the cost of acquired rolling\r\nstock for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the\r\nDublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfees.\r\n\r\nPositing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes\r\nbecome a natural and necessary apodosis?\r\n\r\nGiven a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift\r\nand transfer vouchers during donor\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime or by bequest after\r\ndonor\xe2\x80\x99s painless extinction, of eminent financiers (Blum Pasha,\r\nRothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller)\r\npossessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and\r\njoining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.\r\n\r\nWhat eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?\r\n\r\nThe independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.\r\n\r\nFor what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?\r\n\r\nIt was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic\r\nrelation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil\r\nrecollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for\r\nthe night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and\r\nrenovated vitality.\r\n\r\nHis justifications?\r\n\r\nAs a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human\r\nlife at least 2/7, viz. 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher\r\nhe knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an\r\ninfinitesimal part of any person\xe2\x80\x99s desires has been realised. As a\r\nphysiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant\r\nagencies chiefly operative during somnolence.\r\n\r\nWhat did he fear?\r\n\r\nThe committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of\r\nthe light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence\r\nsituated in the cerebral convolutions.\r\n\r\nWhat were habitually his final meditations?\r\n\r\nOf some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in\r\nwonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded,\r\nreduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span\r\nof casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.\r\n\r\nWhat did the first drawer unlocked contain?\r\n\r\nA Vere Foster\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting copybook, property of Milly (Millicent)\r\nBloom, certain pages of which bore diagram drawings, marked _Papli_,\r\nwhich showed a large globular head with 5 hairs erect, 2 eyes in\r\nprofile, the trunk full front with 3 large buttons, 1 triangular foot:\r\n2 fading photographs of queen Alexandra of England and of Maud\r\nBranscombe, actress and professional beauty: a Yuletide card, bearing\r\non it a pictorial representation of a parasitic plant, the legend\r\n_Mizpah_, the date Xmas 1892, the name of the senders: from Mr + Mrs M.\r\nComerford, the versicle: _May this Yuletide bring to thee, Joy and\r\npeace and welcome glee_: a butt of red partly liquefied sealing wax,\r\nobtained from the stores department of Messrs Hely\xe2\x80\x99s, Ltd., 89, 90, and\r\n91 Dame street: a box containing the remainder of a gross of gilt \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npennibs, obtained from same department of same firm: an old sandglass\r\nwhich rolled containing sand which rolled: a sealed prophecy (never\r\nunsealed) written by Leopold Bloom in 1886 concerning the consequences\r\nof the passing into law of William Ewart Gladstone\xe2\x80\x99s Home Rule bill of\r\n1886 (never passed into law): a bazaar ticket, No 2004, of S.

B.)\r\nfrom Martha Clifford (find M. C.).\r\n\r\nWhat pleasant reflection accompanied this action?\r\n\r\nThe reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his magnetic\r\nface, form and address had been favourably received during the course\r\nof the preceding day by a wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie\r\nPowell), a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian name unknown), a maid,\r\nGertrude (Gerty, family name unknown).\r\n\r\nWhat possibility suggested itself?\r\n\r\nThe possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not\r\nimmediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in\r\nthe company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately\r\nmercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.\r\n\r\nWhat did the 2nd drawer contain?\r\n\r\nDocuments: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment\r\nassurance policy of \xc2\xa3 500 in the Scottish Widows\xe2\x80\x99 Assurance Society,\r\nintestated Millicent (Milly) Bloom, coming into force at 25 years as\r\nwith profit policy of \xc2\xa3 430, \xc2\xa3 462-10-0 and \xc2\xa3 500 at 60 years or death,\r\n65 years or death and death, respectively, or with profit policy\r\n(paidup) of \xc2\xa3 299-10-0 together with cash payment of \xc2\xa3 133-10-0, at\r\noption: a bank passbook issued by the Ulster Bank, College Green branch\r\nshowing statement of a/c for halfyear ending 31 December 1903, balance\r\nin depositor\xe2\x80\x99s favour: \xc2\xa3 18-14-6 (eighteen pounds, fourteen shillings\r\nand sixpence, sterling), net personalty: certificate of possession of \xc2\xa3\r\n900, Canadian 4% (inscribed) government stock (free of stamp duty):\r\ndockets of the Catholic Cemeteries\xe2\x80\x99 (Glasnevin) Committee, relative to\r\na graveplot purchased: a local press cutting concerning change of name\r\nby deedpoll.\r\n\r\nQuote the textual terms of this notice.\r\n\r\nI, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,\r\nformerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice\r\nthat I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all\r\ntimes to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.\r\n\r\nWhat other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the\r\n2nd drawer?\r\n\r\nAn indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolf Virag and his father Leopold\r\nVirag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their\r\n(respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar,\r\nHungary. An ancient haggadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex\r\nspectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual\r\nprayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel,\r\nEnnis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: _To My Dear\r\nSon Leopold_.\r\n\r\nWhat fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words\r\nevoke?\r\n\r\nTomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be\r\n... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her... all\r\nfor me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son... always...\r\nof me... _das Herz... Gott... dein_...\r\n\r\nWhat reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive\r\nmelancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?\r\n\r\nAn old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,\r\nsighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses\r\nof grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the\r\nface in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.\r\n\r\nWhy did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?\r\n\r\nBecause in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain\r\nbeliefs and practices.\r\n\r\nAs?\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the\r\nhebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete\r\nmercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male\r\ninfants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the\r\nineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.\r\n\r\nHow did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?\r\n\r\nNot more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than\r\nother beliefs and practices now appeared.\r\n\r\nWhat first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?\r\n\r\nRudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a\r\nretrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between\r\nDublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with\r\nstatements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,\r\nempress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having\r\ntaken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).\r\nLeopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant\r\nconsultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by\r\nsuggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in\r\nthe various centres mentioned.\r\n\r\nHad time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these\r\nmigrations in narrator and listener?\r\n\r\nIn narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of\r\nnarcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence\r\nof the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.\r\n\r\nWhat idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of\r\namnesia?\r\n\r\nOccasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.\r\nOccasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an\r\ninclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of\r\nfood by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nWhat two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?\r\n\r\nThe myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon\r\nrepletion.\r\n\r\nWhat object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?\r\n\r\nThe endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the\r\npossession of scrip.\r\n\r\nReduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which\r\nthese supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values\r\nto a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.\r\n\r\nSuccessively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor\r\nhawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and\r\ndoubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy:\r\nthat of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in\r\nthe \xc2\xa3, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,\r\ninsinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated\r\nbailiff\xe2\x80\x99s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric\r\npublic laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded\r\nperforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man\xe2\x80\x99s House (Royal\r\nHospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital for reduced but\r\nrespectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of\r\nmisery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic\r\npauper.\r\n\r\nWith which attendant indignities?\r\n\r\nThe unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the\r\ncontempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the\r\nsimulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of\r\nillegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of\r\ndecomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less\r\nthan nothing.\r\n\r\nBy what could such a situation be precluded?\r\n\r\nBy decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).\r\n\r\nWhich preferably?\r\n\r\nThe latter, by the line of least resistance.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?\r\n\r\nConstant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.\r\nThe habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The\r\nnecessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of\r\narrest.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure not irrational?\r\n\r\nThe parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which\r\nbeing done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if\r\nnot disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,\r\nwhich was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting\r\nparties, which was impossible.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure desirable?\r\n\r\nThe attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,\r\nas represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in\r\nspecial ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and\r\nhachures.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland?\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with\r\nsubmerged petrified city, the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort\r\nCarlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the\r\npastures of royal Meath, Brigid\xe2\x80\x99s elm in Kildare, the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Island\r\nshipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.\r\n\r\nAbroad?\r\n\r\nCeylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for\r\nPulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame\r\nstreet, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate\r\nof Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique\r\nbirthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude\r\nGrecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled\r\ninternational finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no\r\nhuman being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters\r\nof soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller\r\nreturns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nUnder what guidance, following what signs?\r\n\r\nAt sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of\r\nintersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior\r\nproduced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the\r\nrightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the\r\nline alpha delta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical\r\nmoon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the\r\nposterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose\r\nnegligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.\r\n\r\nWhat public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the\r\ndeparted?\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa3 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,\r\nmissing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy),\r\nheight 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since\r\ngrown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will\r\nbe paid for information leading to his discovery.\r\n\r\nWhat universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and\r\nnonentity?\r\n\r\nAssumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.\r\n\r\nWhat tributes his?\r\n\r\nHonour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph\r\nimmortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.\r\n\r\nWould the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?\r\n\r\nEver he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his\r\ncometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic\r\nplanets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of\r\nspace, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere\r\nimperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey\r\nthe summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of\r\nthe Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the\r\nconstellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of\r\nperegrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on\r\nmalefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial\r\nresources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver\r\nking.\r\n\r\nWhat would render such return irrational?\r\n\r\nAn unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through\r\nreversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhat play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?\r\n\r\nThe lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of\r\nthe night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,\r\nrendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the\r\nproximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of\r\nwarmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and\r\nrendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,\r\ndesired desire.\r\n\r\nWhat advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an\r\nunoccupied bed?\r\n\r\nThe removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human\r\n(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation\r\nof matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in\r\nthe case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between\r\nthe spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit\r\nsection).\r\n\r\nWhat past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of\r\naccumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?\r\n\r\nThe preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion\r\nand premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John):\r\nthe funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes\r\n(Urim and Thummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the\r\nvisit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along\r\nBedford row, Merchants\xe2\x80\x99 Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the\r\nmusic in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a\r\ntruculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s premises (holocaust): a blank\r\nperiod of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a\r\nleavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine\r\nexhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina\r\nPurefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs\r\nBella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance\r\nmedley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and\r\nfrom the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).\r\n\r\nWhat selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to\r\nconclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?\r\n\r\nThe cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by\r\nthe insentient material of a strainveined timber table.\r\n\r\nWhat selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering\r\nmulticoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily\r\napprehending, not comprehend?\r\n\r\nWho was M\xe2\x80\x99Intosh?\r\n\r\nWhat selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30\r\nyears did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the\r\nextinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?\r\n\r\nWhere was Moses when the candle went out?\r\n\r\nWhat imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with\r\ncollected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel,\r\nsilently, successively, enumerate?\r\n\r\nA provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain\r\na certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,\r\nRobertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.\r\nC.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in\r\nthe case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous\r\nor paid) to the performance of _Leah_ by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the\r\nGaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.\r\n\r\nWhat impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?\r\n\r\nThe face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal\r\nDublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn.\r\n\r\nWhat recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?\r\n\r\nRetreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens\r\nstreet, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines\r\nmeeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from\r\ninfinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the\r\nGreat Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.\r\n\r\nWhat miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were\r\nperceived by him?\r\n\r\nA pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies\xe2\x80\x99 hose, a pair of new\r\nviolet garters, a pair of outsize ladies\xe2\x80\x99 drawers of India mull, cut on\r\ngenerous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti\xe2\x80\x99s Turkish\r\ncigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded\r\ncurvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion\r\nunderskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed\r\nirregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,\r\nhaving capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its\r\nfore side in white lettering B.

(Brian Cooper Tweedy).\r\n\r\nWhat impersonal objects were perceived?\r\n\r\nA commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne\r\ncutting, apple design, on which rested a lady\xe2\x80\x99s black straw hat.\r\nOrangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware\r\nand ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed\r\nirregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin,\r\nsoapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night\r\narticle (on the floor, separate).\r\n\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s acts?\r\n\r\nHe deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining\r\narticles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the\r\nbed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the\r\nproper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to\r\nthe foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nWith circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or\r\nnot his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress\r\nbeing old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous\r\nunder stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of\r\nlust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of\r\nconception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of\r\nmarriage, of sleep and of death.\r\n\r\nWhat did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?\r\n\r\nNew clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,\r\nfemale, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,\r\nsome flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.\r\n\r\nIf he had smiled why would he have smiled?\r\n\r\nTo reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to\r\nenter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if\r\nthe first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,\r\nlast, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor\r\nalone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.\r\n\r\nWhat preceding series?\r\n\r\nAssuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father\r\nBernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society\xe2\x80\x99s Horse Show,\r\nMaggot O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of\r\nDublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an\r\nunknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon\r\nDedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman\r\nJohn Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a\r\nbootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so\r\neach and so on to no last term.\r\n\r\nWhat were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and\r\nlate occupant of the bed?\r\n\r\nReflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a\r\nbillsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a\r\nboaster).\r\n\r\nWhy for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal\r\nproportion and commercial ability?\r\n\r\nBecause he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding\r\nmembers of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably\r\ntransmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with\r\ndesire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene\r\ncomprehension and apprehension.\r\n\r\nWith what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections\r\naffected?\r\n\r\nEnvy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.\r\n\r\nEnvy?\r\n\r\nOf a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the\r\nsuperincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic\r\npiston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of\r\na constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental\r\nfemale organism, passive but not obtuse.\r\n\r\nJealousy?\r\n\r\nBecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately\r\nthe agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between\r\nagent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion\r\nof increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial\r\nreentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of\r\nattraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.\r\n\r\nAbnegation?\r\n\r\nIn virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the\r\nestablishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden\r\nQuay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and\r\nreappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of\r\nambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)\r\nextraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial\r\nprerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current\r\nexpenses, net proceeds divided.\r\n\r\nEquanimity?\r\n\r\nAs as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or\r\nunderstood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in\r\naccordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar\r\nsimilarity. As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the\r\nplanet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less\r\nreprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and\r\nanimals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement,\r\nmisappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,\r\nmalingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail,\r\ncontempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas,\r\ntrespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion\r\nfrom armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence\r\nwith the king\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter,\r\nwilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other\r\nparallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence,\r\nresulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and\r\nits attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits,\r\nindulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable,\r\nirreparable.\r\n\r\nWhy more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?\r\n\r\nFrom outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but\r\noutrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially\r\nviolated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the\r\nadulterously violated.\r\n\r\nWhat retribution, if any?\r\n\r\nAssassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by\r\ncombat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice\r\n(automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses),\r\nnot yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault\r\nwith evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.\r\nHushmoney by moral influence, possibly. If any, positively, connivance,\r\nintroduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of\r\npublicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation,\r\nalienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from\r\nthe other, protecting the separator from both.\r\n\r\nBy what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of\r\nincertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?\r\n\r\nThe preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed\r\nintangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion\r\nbetween the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and\r\nthe selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously\r\ninferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the\r\nvariations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by\r\ninversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite\r\nproposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic\r\ntransitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into\r\nits correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine\r\nsubject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past\r\nparticiple with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice:\r\nthe continued product of seminators by generation: the continual\r\nproduction of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest\r\nor vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of\r\nnescient matter: the apathy of the stars.\r\n\r\nIn what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and\r\nreflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?\r\n\r\nSatisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial\r\nhemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored\r\n(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of\r\nGreece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female\r\nhemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and\r\nseminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,\r\ninsusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,\r\nexpressive of mute immutable mature animality.\r\n\r\nThe visible signs of antesatisfaction?\r\n\r\nAn approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a\r\ntentative revelation: a silent contemplation.\r\n\r\nThen?\r\n\r\nHe kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each\r\nplump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure\r\nprolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.\r\n\r\nThe visible signs of postsatisfaction?\r\n\r\nA silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a\r\nsolicitous aversion: a proximate erection.\r\n\r\nWhat followed this silent action?\r\n\r\nSomnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,\r\ncatechetical interrogation.\r\n\r\nWith what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?\r\n\r\nNegative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between\r\nMartha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in\r\nthe vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,\r\nLimited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and\r\nresponse thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),\r\nsurname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs\r\nBandmann Palmer of _Leah_ at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South\r\nKing street, an invitation to supper at Wynn\xe2\x80\x99s (Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s) Hotel, 35, 36\r\nand 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical\r\ntendency entituled _Sweets of Sin_, anonymous author a gentleman of\r\nfashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement\r\nin the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since\r\ncompletely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author,\r\neldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an\r\naeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a\r\nwitness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of\r\ndecision and gymnastic flexibility.\r\n\r\nWas the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\nWhich event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?\r\n\r\nStephen Dedalus, professor and author.\r\n\r\nWhat limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were\r\nperceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the\r\ncourse of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?\r\n\r\nBy the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been\r\ncelebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8\r\nSeptember 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with\r\nfemale issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated\r\non the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,\r\nwith ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last\r\ntaken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29\r\nDecember 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,\r\naged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days\r\nduring which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without\r\nejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a\r\nlimitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete\r\nmental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place\r\nsince the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage,\r\nof the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there\r\nremained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of\r\na preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the\r\nconsummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of\r\naction had been circumscribed.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nBy various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine\r\ndestination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration\r\nfor which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,\r\nprojected or effected.\r\n\r\nWhat moved visibly above the listener\xe2\x80\x99s and the narrator\xe2\x80\x99s invisible\r\nthoughts?\r\n\r\nThe upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of\r\nconcentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.\r\n\r\nIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\r\n\r\nListener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of\r\nlatitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45\xc2\xb0 to\r\nthe terrestrial equator.\r\n\r\nIn what state of rest or motion?\r\n\r\nAt rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being\r\neach and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by\r\nthe proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of\r\nneverchanging space.\r\n\r\nIn what posture?\r\n\r\nListener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg\r\nextended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the\r\nattitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator:\r\nreclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index\r\nfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose,\r\nin the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn,\r\nthe childman weary, the manchild in the womb.\r\n\r\nWomb? Weary?\r\n\r\nHe rests. He has travelled.\r\n\r\nWith?\r\n\r\nSinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and\r\nWhinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and\r\nBinbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and\r\nHinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and\r\nVinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.\r\n\r\nWhen?\r\n\r\nGoing to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nauk\xe2\x80\x99s egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of\r\nDarkinbad the Brightdayler.\r\n\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 18 ]\r\n\r\n\r\nYes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his\r\nbreakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when\r\nhe used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his\r\nhighness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan\r\nthat he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing\r\nall for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was\r\nactually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all\r\nher ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and\r\nearthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God\r\nhelp the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and\r\nlownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was\r\npious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like\r\nher a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a\r\nwelleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here\r\nand Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her\r\ndog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats\r\nespecially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that\r\nand waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always\r\nif ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much\r\nbetter for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I\r\nsuppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have\r\na hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till\r\nthey throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as\r\nmuch a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre\r\nsick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was\r\nO tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he\r\nsprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day\r\nI wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones\r\nshe could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into\r\na mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying\r\non account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more\r\nlike a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same\r\nbesides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor\r\nparing his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I\r\nwas sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it\r\nnot to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by\r\nhis appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her\r\nso either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was\r\nreally and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it\r\nplanning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember\r\nMenton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he\r\nnot long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and\r\nturned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what\r\nharm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to\r\nhim mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever\r\nmet and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle\r\nin bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in\r\nwith somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as\r\nI do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a\r\nletter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the\r\npaper as if something told me and he covered it up with the\r\nblottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably\r\nthat was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all\r\nmen get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is\r\nnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old\r\nfool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I\r\ncare two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though\r\nId like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my\r\nnose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace\r\npadding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell\r\nof those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by\r\ngetting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat\r\nwithout that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was\r\ndrinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of\r\ncourse ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table\r\non Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing\r\nmy potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if\r\nyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on\r\nwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you\r\nhave no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters\r\nbut I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be\r\nalone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I\r\nfound in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a\r\nlittle bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave\r\nher her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do\r\nout the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out\r\nthe dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I\r\ncouldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar\r\nand sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the\r\nplace in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because\r\nhe couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere\r\nand the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan\r\ngave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there\r\nsteals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb\r\nto squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he\r\nhas an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out\r\nand going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the\r\nsatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be\r\nalways and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking\r\nboy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id\r\nconfuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my\r\ngarters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I\r\nknow what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging\r\ndrawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this\r\nthat and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would\r\nbecause I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in\r\nthe jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a\r\nstranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and\r\nhe tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he\r\nis who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it\r\ntell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine\r\nIm him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what\r\nhe never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply\r\nruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it\r\ntill he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your\r\nlips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the\r\nworld about it people make its only the first time after that its just\r\nthe ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man\r\nwithout going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when\r\nyou feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish\r\nsome man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in\r\nhis arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul\r\nalmost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to\r\nFather Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and\r\nI said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my\r\nchild on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where\r\nyou sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done\r\nwith it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put\r\nit I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he\r\nwant to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat\r\nhand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he\r\nId say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in\r\nthe box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never\r\nturn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost\r\nfor a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them\r\nId like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense\r\noff him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre\r\nmarried hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the\r\npope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt\r\nlike his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though\r\nI laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of\r\nhis fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it\r\nwho gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of\r\ndrink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they\r\nstick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking\r\ngreen and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with\r\nthe opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American\r\nthat had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do\r\nto keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took\r\nthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt\r\nlovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I\r\npopped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful\r\nto us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when\r\nI blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in\r\nGibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and\r\ntell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing\r\nabout nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that\r\nevening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it\r\nbrought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to\r\nchurch mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only\r\ngrey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I\r\nlit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that\r\ntremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or\r\nwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is\r\nnot so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my\r\nhours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a\r\nthick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think\r\na few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life\r\nfelt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must\r\nhave eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with\r\na big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into\r\nyou because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious\r\nlook in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a\r\ntremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on\r\nme considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt\r\nwashed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice\r\ninvention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if\r\nsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went\r\nthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina\r\nPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up\r\nwith a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a\r\nsmell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like\r\na nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the\r\nlast time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and\r\nbawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied\r\ntill they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what\r\nsupposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was\r\nmarried Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has\r\nmore spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting\r\nJosie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him\r\noff well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I\r\nknow they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing\r\nand sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming\r\nand then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not\r\nliking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over\r\npolitics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a\r\ncarpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive\r\nabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for\r\nI knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he\r\nannoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot\r\nof mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often\r\nwanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family\r\nphysician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was\r\ncrowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with\r\nher over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever\r\nhe asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me\r\nthe present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that\r\nfinished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I\r\nknow how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out\r\nto see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know\r\nplenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch\r\nhim with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them\r\nall spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of\r\ncourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him\r\nthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love\r\nhim and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might\r\nimagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of\r\na manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it\r\nout of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and\r\nwasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the\r\nnight in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I\r\nwant to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper\r\nwith my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too\r\nmuch the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know\r\nmore than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie\r\nwhenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I\r\nsaid I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash\r\npossible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick\r\nwhen hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the\r\nindifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\r\nspoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at\r\nthat time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was\r\ntoo beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged\r\nafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of\r\nlaughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\r\nout one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great\r\nhumour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it\r\nmeant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us\r\nnot all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault\r\nshe didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes\r\ngot like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\r\nface beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she\r\nmust have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment\r\nshe was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk\r\nabout him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes\r\nhe used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him\r\njust imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might\r\nmurder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes\r\nmad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when\r\nhe comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he\r\nalways takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and\r\nnow hes going about in his slippers to look for \xc2\xa3 10000 for a postcard\r\nU p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff\r\nto extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what\r\ncould you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than\r\nmarry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like\r\nme to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and\r\nhe knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick\r\nthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man\r\nyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and\r\ndo a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating\r\ndrive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask\r\nus to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because\r\nthey cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off\r\nflypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say\r\nits from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have\r\nbeen madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being\r\nhanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do\r\nbesides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they\r\n\r\ntheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he\r\nnoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C\r\nwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both\r\nordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his\r\ntwo old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it\r\nwas what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed\r\nbreeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting\r\nall myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long\r\none I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got\r\nafter some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish\r\ntimes lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to\r\nMrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the\r\nturning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea\r\n2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him\r\nbecause I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he\r\nmeant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that\r\nif I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill\r\nstick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still\r\nI made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of\r\na concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to\r\nmull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my\r\nstockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another\r\ntime it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I\r\ncould find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world\r\nthat I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and\r\nbeat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because\r\nthe stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in\r\nthe Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere\r\nI noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell\r\nDArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on\r\nthe choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting\r\nfor O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown\r\npart he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was\r\nalways raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his\r\nmouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a\r\nplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him\r\nabout that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there\r\nand show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it\r\nor lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an\r\nidea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got\r\nme so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me\r\nto give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming\r\nalong Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had\r\nto take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape\r\nof my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me\r\nwhen I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject\r\nof drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced\r\nthings on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels\r\neven when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one\r\nin the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see\r\nevery atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain\r\nI saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the\r\nHarolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the\r\nZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking\r\nslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they\r\ncan go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on\r\nit and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were\r\nyou where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me\r\nhis eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it\r\nwas getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he\r\npestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he\r\nsaid my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an\r\nexcuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time\r\ntill I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his\r\nwaistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in\r\nthe rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them\r\nand beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the\r\nsunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet\r\nif I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you\r\nnever know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it\r\nif anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers\r\noutside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him\r\nfrom doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he\r\ncircumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do\r\neverything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting\r\nall the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the\r\nbutchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me\r\nthat letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to\r\nany woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we\r\nmet asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw\r\nI wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was\r\nalways breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky\r\nman and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake\r\ndont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it\r\nused to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in\r\nGibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children\r\nseeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice\r\na day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman\r\nwhen he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote\r\nthe night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it\r\nsimply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to\r\nembrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the\r\nsame time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you\r\nthink its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the\r\ndoor of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface\r\nGoodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after\r\ndinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me\r\nprofessor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in\r\nhis way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out\r\nyou have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I\r\nthought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches\r\nfirst and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was\r\ntrying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he\r\nmust have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2\r\nDedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch\r\nhe gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after\r\nwhen I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty\r\nwhen I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even\r\nput on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week\r\nwere to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers\r\nanniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms\r\nat the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new\r\nbed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next\r\nroom or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the\r\nwall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all\r\nvery well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we\r\nnever did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes\r\ngoing where he is besides something always happens with him the time\r\ngoing to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for\r\nthe two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with\r\nthe soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and\r\nthe waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion\r\nfor the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two\r\ngentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was\r\ntoo hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a\r\ngood job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd\r\nhave taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him\r\nO I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I\r\nwonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the\r\ntrain by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots\r\nof men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly\r\nbe that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone\r\nin the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something\r\nabout him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the\r\nwindow all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what\r\nwould they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last\r\nconcert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall\r\nClarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen\r\nKearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my\r\nsinging the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts\r\nwhen I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him\r\nmanaged it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to\r\nsing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead\r\nKindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out\r\nhe was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some\r\nold opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein\r\nlately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and\r\nnonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very\r\nintelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats\r\nall I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I\r\nhate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and\r\nLadysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd\r\nEast Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and\r\njust the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was\r\nlovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty\r\nhe was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the\r\nroad he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could\r\nhave made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of\r\nthe other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of\r\ndragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their\r\nfever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love\r\nto see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish\r\ncavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from\r\nAlgeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham\r\nbattles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the\r\nmarch past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O\r\nthe lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made\r\nhis money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me\r\na nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen\r\nup there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like\r\nI had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going\r\nround with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave\r\nthis ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the\r\nknuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or\r\ntell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go\r\nand smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money\r\nand hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I\r\ncould find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when\r\nI looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the\r\nexpression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with\r\nhis big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat\r\nalways having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from\r\nbehind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the\r\ndogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so\r\nquiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the\r\nway it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish\r\ntie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly\r\nwelloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he\r\nwas like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the\r\nstoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20\r\nquid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for\r\nme on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that\r\nsponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming\r\nback that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor\r\nlooking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first\r\nnoticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I\r\nwished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my\r\nfingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for\r\nI didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers\r\nwere hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have\r\nslipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always\r\nhanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down\r\nyour throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a\r\ngreat compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case\r\nif its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one\r\nthing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I\r\nthink didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them\r\neither naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she\r\ndidnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of\r\nsilkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought\r\nthem back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one\r\nchange them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into\r\nhim and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id\r\nwant advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips\r\nhe saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a\r\ndelightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance\r\nacross the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill\r\nhave to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it\r\nthe last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his\r\nmoney easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a\r\ncottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret\r\nthat he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die\r\nof the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that\r\nantifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the\r\nfashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats\r\nall he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was\r\nthe face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like\r\nnew I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place\r\nand dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to\r\nhim Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to\r\nwash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax\r\nand violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the\r\nskin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger\r\nafter the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry\r\nhandkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world\r\nwithout style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it\r\naround I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea\r\ninto the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues\r\nitself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all\r\nthe brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners\r\n3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the\r\nother the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because\r\nthey know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every\r\nday for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all\r\nIll be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith\r\nshes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys\r\non the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down\r\nto her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham\r\nstreet 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it\r\nas if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the\r\nday before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of\r\nWales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads\r\nonly for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black\r\nmans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny\r\nstory about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster\r\nknife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and\r\nthe prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing\r\nlike that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master\r\nFrancois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her\r\near because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and\r\nher a\xe2\x80\x94e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that\r\npretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody\r\ncan see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that\r\ntwice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs\r\nhim up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a\r\nwoman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out\r\nof her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the\r\ncrib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have\r\na child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of\r\nher side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and\r\nshe a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar\r\nthe year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted\r\nthe tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me\r\ntoo if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to\r\nchuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it\r\nand go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank\r\nwhere they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day\r\nof course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with\r\nhim any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe\r\nlike father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching\r\nabout for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still\r\nonly for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could\r\nhave got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada\r\nonce or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly\r\nMrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I\r\nlost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming\r\ninto fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no\r\ngood by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as\r\nI said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot\r\nof trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me\r\naltogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and\r\ncooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I\r\nwent by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes\r\ntake that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles\r\noff my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my\r\nbackside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in\r\nGrafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as\r\ninsolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were\r\ngiving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of\r\nher yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second\r\ntime he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see\r\nhim looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for\r\nme it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs\r\nBloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him\r\nbeing insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled\r\nI know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely\r\nsorry and Im sure you were\r\n\r\nyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he\r\nmade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one\r\nanyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep\r\nthat up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out\r\nfor him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2\r\nthe same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up\r\nthere like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide\r\nit with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a\r\nman looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down\r\nout of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it\r\nwith a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat\r\nmarket or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the\r\nstatue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was\r\npissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one\r\nside the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved\r\nthem theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed\r\noutside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to\r\ntry some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7\r\nwonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night\r\ncoming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade\r\nto make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting\r\ncold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was\r\na few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see\r\nme squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it\r\nbefore I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not\r\nafraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the\r\nwoman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for\r\na picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the\r\njob in Helys and I was

great\r\nfellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there\r\nfrom before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the\r\nson then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums\r\nrolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with\r\nmesstins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their\r\njellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men\r\nto cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the\r\ngates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about\r\nRorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum\r\nlighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil\r\nwith his grog on the windowsill catch him

switch of false hair on her and vain about her\r\nappearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles\r\nwith all her religion domineering because she never could get over the\r\nAtlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack\r\nflying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took\r\nall the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough\r\nin Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there\r\nwas a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black\r\nblessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on\r\nEaster Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell\r\nbringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an\r\nadmirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him\r\nup when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window\r\nthen he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making\r\nan appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it\r\nup in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill\r\ninstructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps\r\nsinging I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the\r\nold stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under\r\nthe Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what\r\nkissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was\r\nsweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way\r\nwhat did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish\r\nnobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to\r\nbe married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in\r\njest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about\r\nmyself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I\r\nsuppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all\r\nthe flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and\r\nthe perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the\r\nblack water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it\r\nwas May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in\r\nthe spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the\r\nrockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all\r\nabout the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail\r\ncareering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was\r\na regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and\r\nthrow stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that\r\nwhite blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could\r\nwithout too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was\r\ntired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be\r\nthe highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those\r\nfrightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever\r\nthey call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots\r\nIm sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when\r\nthey die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing\r\nyes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever\r\nhe caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I\r\nwas leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness\r\nout of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last\r\nday transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he\r\nwanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was\r\nawfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me\r\nwith a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop\r\neven if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was\r\nafraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once\r\ntook something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered\r\nwith limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of\r\nyoud think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with\r\nyou in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling\r\nthere so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I\r\npulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I\r\nopened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I\r\nhad a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first\r\ntickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt\r\nawokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the\r\nsame I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got\r\nover him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back\r\nthe skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the\r\nmiddle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was\r\nhis name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was\r\nrather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the\r\nwhatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed\r\ncome back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed\r\ndo it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now\r\nflying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20\r\nyears if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put\r\nhis hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young\r\nstill about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is\r\nquite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has\r\nshe little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever\r\ndreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you\r\nmight say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I\r\nwas a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in\r\nfrom Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and\r\npigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle\r\nhill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to\r\nread out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he\r\nhadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he\r\nalways wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso\r\nswinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long\r\npreach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle\r\nand wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and\r\nme more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that\r\nwould be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it\r\nlooked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M\r\nBloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well\r\nits better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with\r\nbottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I\r\nwouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my\r\nmother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows\r\nafter the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along\r\nWilliss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other\r\nside of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like\r\nMillys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down\r\nat them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars\r\npulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was\r\nto write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world\r\nand back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while\r\nthey can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up\r\nWindmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that\r\nwas dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from\r\non board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral\r\nnecklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay\r\nof Tangier white and the

at\r\nthe elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow\r\nfor the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that\r\nGibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on\r\nyou more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me\r\nthat clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south\r\nAfrica where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they\r\nwere well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it\r\nlike an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold\r\nbecause it was very

that\r\nbook he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other\r\nMr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with\r\nhis tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white\r\nshoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather\r\nall blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell\r\nof the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan\r\nbay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the\r\nfishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa\r\nand the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to\r\nclimb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago\r\nbesides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place

brassplate or\r\nBlooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the\r\nway his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he\r\nwas going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely\r\nplaces we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the\r\ngondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of\r\nand mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was\r\ngoing to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry\r\nmy can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the\r\nplans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old\r\nbeggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and\r\nput his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of\r\nthat hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in\r\njail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine\r\nhis poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles\r\naway from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows\r\nto make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a\r\nmadhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute\r\nlike that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed\r\nId cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better\r\nthan nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and\r\nhe went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was\r\nlooking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits\r\nmaking as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit\r\nthere isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling\r\nespecially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl\r\ndown there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather\r\ninstead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not\r\nlike me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the\r\nsame on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way\r\nhe plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the\r\nplace lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming\r\nin without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as\r\nI was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then\r\ndoing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to\r\nlook at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack\r\nstatue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got\r\nthat little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2\r\nshillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right\r\nnot to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at\r\nthe table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to\r\nunderstand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant\r\nsay I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and\r\nhelping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its\r\nme shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on\r\nthe shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now\r\nshes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me\r\nwhistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly\r\ncome out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her\r\nround in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well\r\nhe sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to\r\ngo on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I\r\nsmelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I\r\nsewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I\r\ntell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a\r\nparting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out\r\nno matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your\r\nblouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle\r\nblackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on\r\nshow on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at\r\nher like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you\r\nthen a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the\r\nTheatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me\r\nafraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that\r\ntouching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always\r\ntrying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for\r\nBeerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed\r\nlike that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me\r\nthere and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to\r\nget near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same\r\nlittle game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but\r\nhe didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the\r\nBroadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance\r\non her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands\r\nswollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything\r\ndeep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into\r\nthe wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that\r\nConny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with\r\nsealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he\r\nlooked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and\r\nsupper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man\r\ngives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a\r\nfew men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it\r\nreally happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love\r\nin their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each\r\nother that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit\r\nfoolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and\r\npoison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes\r\nalways making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to\r\nput her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time\r\nenough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes\r\npretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too\r\nbut theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a\r\nfishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we\r\nmet Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to\r\nsee us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough\r\ntill I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that\r\nnow for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me\r\nthat exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because\r\nhow was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night\r\nbefore cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to\r\nleave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as\r\nshe said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was\r\nthe last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself\r\nthey darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the\r\ntwo of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever\r\ngoing to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming\r\nId have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that\r\nold Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the\r\nthings into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course\r\nshes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly\r\ndishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something\r\nand opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends\r\nto entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you\r\nplease that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father\r\nsuch a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the\r\ncricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at\r\nthe other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won\r\nthem in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody\r\nsaw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand\r\nfuneral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody\r\nhawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head\r\nI ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been\r\nhanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the\r\nironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was\r\nsomething else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and\r\nnow shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband\r\ngetting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they\r\nhave to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats\r\nher Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres\r\nsome new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out

something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual\r\nmonthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like\r\nthat the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him\r\nto see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about\r\ninsurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt\r\ngive in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his\r\nglasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul\r\nthats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could\r\nall in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it\r\nout then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry\r\nsupposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery\r\nhissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a\r\nwoman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up\r\nfor it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is\r\nbetter off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience\r\nabove its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me\r\npregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just\r\nput on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn\r\nit and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a\r\nvirgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you\r\ncould be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do\r\nor blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this\r\npooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what\r\nbetween clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too\r\njingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the\r\nother side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor\r\nwith the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think\r\nit is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I\r\nmight look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next\r\ntime he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face\r\nwheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me\r\nafter that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I\r\nmade him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse\r\nand skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be\r\nhe never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits\r\neasy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling\r\nlike a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for\r\na wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning\r\ndont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look\r\nhow white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit\r\nhere how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get\r\nup on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey\r\nlily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore\r\n\r\nwho knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I\r\nsomething growing in me getting that thing like that every week when\r\nwas it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to\r\nthe doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that\r\nwhite thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick\r\nDr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called\r\nit I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting\r\nround those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every\r\nlittle fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of\r\ncourse so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last\r\nman in the world besides theres something queer about their children\r\nalways smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what\r\nI did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one\r\nthing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly\r\nold face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and\r\ncould you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the\r\nrock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by\r\nthe way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I\r\ncan squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and\r\nneedles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by\r\nMillys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the\r\nsame paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and\r\nasking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all\r\nthe words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked\r\nsideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows\r\nwhat else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out\r\nfrowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you\r\nlying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever\r\nenough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad\r\ncrazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious\r\nBody everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and\r\nof joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he\r\nhad me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I\r\nhadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him\r\nup I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited\r\nme I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in\r\nRehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes\r\nas if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking\r\nafter my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half\r\nsloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand\r\nfor a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his\r\nblather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool\r\nof a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O\r\nbeau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and\r\nrigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy\r\nanything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st\r\nopportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom\r\npretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk\r\nand sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I\r\nlaughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight\r\nsitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so\r\nthat a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose\r\nthere isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at\r\nthe way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard\r\nbolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth\r\nbreathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to\r\nshow one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a\r\npinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out\r\nthat he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put\r\ntogether all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody\r\nI suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big\r\nsquare feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway\r\nwheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt\r\ncreak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere\r\nstill she must have given him great value for his money of course he\r\nhas to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll\r\nhave something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God\r\nhelp us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always\r\nreminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often\r\nenough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to\r\nadmire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like\r\nmy bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses\r\nwere we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard\r\nstreet and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on\r\nthe run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the\r\nmen with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse\r\nand worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always\r\nsomebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always\r\nknow who was in there last every time were just getting on right\r\nsomething happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr\r\nCuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old\r\nlottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives\r\nimpudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the\r\nFreeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the\r\nfreemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along\r\nin the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much\r\nconsolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed\r\njudging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres\r\nGeorges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well\r\nthats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody\r\nclimbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that\r\nlittle habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if\r\nhe has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I\r\ndont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their\r\nlies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont\r\nbelieve you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats\r\nMasterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in\r\nreal life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is\r\ndisgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads\r\nand no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about\r\nwith not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow\r\npoison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both\r\nsides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let\r\nhim lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the\r\none thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews\r\nused when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast\r\nor speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough\r\nfor one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his\r\nown pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that\r\nwethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and\r\nlock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder\r\nwas it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too\r\nno hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants\r\nme and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that\r\nforlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some\r\nlittle bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the\r\nCollege races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his\r\nnob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at\r\nthose two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no\r\nuse of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr\r\nPaddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in\r\nthe paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd\r\nbe something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind\r\nin black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that\r\nbit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or\r\nother and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys\r\nhusband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye\r\ntrying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old\r\ngreen dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way\r\nlike dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call\r\nthat friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with\r\ntheir wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping\r\nthat barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be\r\nsick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still\r\nthough hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of\r\nthem well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches\r\nif I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well\r\nwhen he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not

improve her appearance theyre awfully\r\nbecoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at\r\nthe Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he\r\nborrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and\r\nsquashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a\r\nwellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough\r\nthat must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the\r\npreserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and\r\nSimon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the\r\nsecond verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly\r\nsang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying\r\ntoo when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had\r\na delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart\r\n_sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_\r\ngoodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in\r\nit all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we\r\nsang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even\r\ntransposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed\r\nsay or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I\r\nwonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a\r\nuniversity professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he\r\ndriving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have\r\ngot it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look\r\nyoung in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and\r\nme too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge\r\nstation with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago\r\nnow yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for\r\nwhat was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for\r\nme I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted\r\nhed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time\r\nhe was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord\r\nFauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw\r\nhim at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God\r\nyes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out\r\nthe deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met\r\nbefore I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either\r\nbesides

greasy hair hanging into his eyes or\r\nstanding up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only\r\ngetting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry\r\nwhen I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not\r\nan ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I\r\nwonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15\r\nyesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose\r\nhes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not\r\nthat stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting\r\ndown in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of\r\ncourse he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was\r\nout of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not\r\na professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson\r\nthey all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont\r\nfind many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where\r\npoetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully\r\ncoming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point\r\nthe guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back\r\nthere again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that\r\nfor him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly\r\nbright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young\r\nstar itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to\r\ntalk to

hot on for it and not\r\ncare a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of\r\nthose wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near\r\nthe Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only\r\nsent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back\r\nover and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow\r\nwith the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me\r\nup against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do\r\nthemselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up\r\nsomewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us\r\nthe fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course\r\nit was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and\r\nwhen I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after\r\ncoming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his\r\nwife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten\r\nagain with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the\r\nlove of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well\r\nhe may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he\r\nknew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to\r\nsigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for\r\nLord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around\r\ndown in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled\r\nup like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like\r\nto see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I\r\ndont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be\r\ngoverned by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one\r\nanother and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around\r\ndrunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on\r\nhorses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop\r\nsure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know\r\nwhat it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they\r\nall of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I\r\nnever had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away\r\nfrom his books and studies and not living at home on account of the\r\nusual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a\r\nfine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to\r\nmake one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two\r\ndogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that\r\ndisheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in\r\nthat little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some\r\npoor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it\r\nwas we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into\r\nthe glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I\r\nfelt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of\r\nroving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and\r\npickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining\r\nhimself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to\r\nlove coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends\r\nthey can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some\r\nwoman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder\r\nthey treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I\r\nsuppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like\r\nthat he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I\r\nsuppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the\r\nnext room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I\r\nwonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had\r\nthe devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave\r\nme the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and\r\nPisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown\r\nmyself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the\r\nbits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and\r\nCrutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am\r\na harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day\r\nolder than then I wonder could I get my tongue

never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs\r\nRubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the\r\ntwo ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the\r\nSpanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant\r\nwhat a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and\r\nwanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in\r\nbed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad\r\nluck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and\r\nsomething nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might\r\nlike I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the\r\ncriada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you\r\nsee something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself\r\nnot knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend\r\nwe were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is\r\ndos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head\r\nsometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres\r\nthe room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his\r\nwriting and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he\r\ndoes at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes\r\nmaking the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to\r\ntake in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house\r\nlike this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated\r\nperson Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with\r\nthe fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown\r\nthat I badly want or a peachblossom

into me Ive a mind to tell\r\nhim every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right\r\nits all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery\r\nsaid O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of\r\ntears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I\r\nsuppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt\r\nhave

hole as hes\r\nthere my brown part then Ill tell him I want \xc2\xa3 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill\r\ntell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he\r\nwont be too bad I dont want to

till he asked me to say yes and I\r\nwouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was\r\nthinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and\r\nHester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all\r\nbirds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the\r\npier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the

and the devil knows who\r\nelse from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market\r\nall clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half\r\nasleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the\r\nsteps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle\r\nthousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and\r\nturbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop\r\nand Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice\r\nhid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night\r\nand the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the\r\nwatchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown\r\ntorrent O and the sea the sea crimson

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
