Written by a participant of the expedition, Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelation has a greater value than any other narrative of the voyage.\r\nIts great value and the fact that it has never been adequately\r\npresented to the English-speaking public have induced the editors to\r\ninsert this relation in the present series both in the original Italian\r\n(rigidly adhering to and preserving all the peculiarities of the\r\noriginal manuscript) and in English translation. This relation is\r\nespecially valuable for its descriptions of the various peoples,\r\ncountries, and products, of Oriental seas, and for its vocabularies, as\r\nwell as for its account of the first circumnavigation. From its very\r\nnature, the relation has called for an unusual amount of annotation,\r\nwhich has been drawn freely from various sources: chiefly Mosto\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nannotations in his publication of Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s relation in Part V,\r\nvolume iii, of the Raccolta di documenti e studi, published by the\r\nRoyal Columbian Commission of the fourth centenary of the discovery of\r\nAmerica under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction (Roma,\r\n1894); Navarrete\xe2\x80\x99s Col. de viages, iv (Madrid, 1837); various\r\npublications of the Hakluyt Society; and F. H. H. Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Life\r\nof Ferdinand Magellan (New York, 1891). The publication of the original\r\nItalian and the English, page for page, renders it necessary to place\r\nthe annotations at the end of the volume instead of in footnote as\r\nhitherto. The various charts of the Italian manuscript are all\r\npresented in facsimile in the course of the work. In order that the\r\nvarious peculiarities of the manuscript might be preserved, it has been\r\nnecessary to specially design and cast certain characters that appear\r\nin Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s narrative. None of these characters have been\r\nreproduced by Mosto, who also writes out all abbreviations. Throughout\r\nwe have aimed to present the document as it exists in the Biblioteca\r\nAmbrosiana (even to the spacing of words) with the exception that\r\nparagraphs in the manuscript begin with a hanging indention and usually\r\nend with a series of dots and dashes. A brief synopsis of the relation\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief dedication to the grand master of the Hospitaler knights\r\nof Rhodes or Malta, as they were called later, and of which order he is\r\na member, Pigafetta relates that, being at Barcelona in 1519 with the\r\npapal legate, he first hears of the expedition about to set out under\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es. Being desirous of seeing the world, he gains permission to\r\naccompany the expedition, and soon joins the fleet at Seville, whence\r\nit is to depart. Magalh\xc3\xa3es, as a wise commander, issues his\r\ninstructions to the various commanders of the vessels ere port is left,\r\nso that they may keep together in the unknown seas before them, and\r\nthat they may act in harmony.\r\n\r\nSetting sail from Seville on August 10, 1519, the fleet of five small\r\nvessels starts on its long journey amid salvos of artillery. At the\r\nmouth of the Guadalquivir, San Lucar de Barrameda, they anchor until\r\nSeptember 20, when setting sail once more, they make for the Canaries,\r\nwhich are reached September 26. There they reprovision and taking their\r\ndeparture on October 3, coast southward along Africa amid alternating\r\ncalms and violent storms (cheered however by the welcome apparition of\r\nSt. Elmo\xe2\x80\x99s fire, which promises them safety), until they cross the\r\nline. Thereupon taking a general westerly course, the cape of St.\r\nAugustine on the Brazilian coast is soon sighted. The fresh provisions,\r\nso essential to sea voyages, are procured on the coast of Brazil, where\r\noccurs the first communication with the natives, with whom wonderful\r\nbargains are made. Those Indians, cannibals though they be, and whom\r\nPigafetta describes briefly (not failing to inscribe some of their\r\nlanguage) receive the mariners hospitably, and thinking that the latter\r\nare come to remain among them, build them a house. But after a stay of\r\neighteen days, the sails are again trimmed toward the south, and\r\ndescending the coast, Magalh\xc3\xa3es anchors next at the Rio de la Plata\r\nwhich had formerly proved so disastrous to Juan de Solis and his men.\r\nUnable here to hold converse with the anthropophagous natives, who flee\r\nat their approach, the fleet retakes its course, anchoring at two\r\nislands where many sea-wolves and penguins are taken, and thus fresh\r\nfood obtained. The next anchorage is at the famous Bay of St. Julian\r\nalong the desolate Patagonian coast, where for five months they winter.\r\nFor two months not an individual is seen, but one day they gain their\r\nfirst sight of the Patagonians, whose huge bulk strikes all with\r\nsurprise, and who are held as giants. Amicable relations are entered\r\ninto with various of these wandering Indians, and finally Magalh\xc3\xa3es,\r\nwith the taste for the wonderful that characterized his period, as\r\nstrongly, or more strongly than our own, determines to capture two of\r\nthem to take back to Spain as novelties. His ruse is successful, but an\r\nattempt to induce the wife of one of the Indians to go to the ship\r\nfails. Very interesting are these giants to the curious Pigafetta, and\r\nto him is due the earliest description of their manners and customs and\r\nthe earliest specimens of their language. The two captured giants are\r\nplaced in separate vessels, but unfortunately both die ere reaching the\r\nend of the journey, one in the deserting ship \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe other in Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s own ship, the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the five months at that port \xe2\x80\x9cmany things happened there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShortly after entering the port, the most critical moment of all\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s life comes, and one which he has perhaps, dreaded from\r\nthe beginning of the expedition. This is the mutiny headed by Juan de\r\nCartagena, captain of one of the vessels, and other malcontents, who\r\nhate Magalh\xc3\xa3es because he is a Portuguese. The latter, however, proves\r\nequal to the emergency, and by his prompt action and the punishments\r\ntempered by mercy that he inflicts, quiets the trouble. Jo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o,\r\ncaptain of the \xe2\x80\x9cSantiago\xe2\x80\x9d is sent to explore the coast, but is\r\nshipwrecked, although all the crew are saved. Their rescue (not well\r\ntold by Pigafetta) is a thrilling and arduous matter, and calls into\r\nplay the endurance of men already tried by misfortune and buffetings\r\nwith Nature.\r\n\r\nWith the fleet reduced to four vessels, the mariners leave port St.\r\nJulian and proceeding along the coast, anchor at the river of Sardines,\r\nwhere stormy weather threatens a disastrous end to the expedition. A\r\nstay of two months is made, during which the ships are enabled to lay\r\nin a good supply of provisions, wood, and water. Before leaving that\r\nriver, the crews (for Magalh\xc3\xa3es looks after the spiritual welfare of\r\nhis men) confess and take communion. Then resuming the voyage, the\r\ngreat object of the first half of the expedition is attained, namely,\r\nthe discovery of the strait, which occurs October 21, 1520. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nstrait is one hundred and ten leguas ... long, and it is one-half legua\r\nbroad, more or less.\xe2\x80\x9d Its discovery is due to the indomitable energy\r\nand endurance of Magalh\xc3\xa3es, and his certain knowledge (probably\r\noverstated by Pigafetta) of its existence. Continuing, Pigafetta\r\nbriefly narrates the passage through the strait, and the desertion of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio,\xe2\x80\x9d which returns to Spain, after putting the\r\ncaptain, Alvaro de Mesquita, a relative of Magalh\xc3\xa3es, in irons; for\r\nthe pilot, a Portuguese named Esteban Gomez, is jealous of Magalh\xc3\xa3es,\r\nas the latter\xe2\x80\x99s expedition has destroyed ambitious plans of his own.\r\nThe other three ships, leaving letters and signals in the strait, in\r\ncase the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d tries to regain them, proceeds on its way,\r\ndebouching from the strait November 28. Then begins a long voyage over\r\nthe trackless Pacific \xe2\x80\x9cin truth ... very pacific;\xe2\x80\x9d and the three\r\nships sail on steadily for three and two-thirds months without being\r\nable to reprovision. To the horrors of famine are added the sufferings\r\nof the dread scurvy. Pigafetta, whose curiosity is always alert and\r\nactive, and who remains well, diverts himself with talking to the\r\nPatagonian, who is finally baptized, but who is one of those to die. In\r\nthe vast stretch from the strait to the Ladrones (first seen by them of\r\nall Europeans), only two islands, both desert, are sighted, and those,\r\nsince they are unable to find anchorage there, are called the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate Isles.\xe2\x80\x9d Pigafetta mentions the southern constellation\r\nCrux and the star clouds since called after Magalh\xc3\xa3es. His\r\ngeographical information, as one might expect, is not always accurate,\r\nfor he places Cipangu (Japan) in the open Pacific. Thoughts of relief\r\nthat come upon sighting various islands (which they called the Ladrones\r\nbecause of the thievishness of the inhabitants) are quickly dissipated\r\nby the hostility there encountered. So bold are these natives (whose\r\nappearance, life, and customs, Pigafetta describes briefly), that they\r\neven steal the ship\xe2\x80\x99s boat from the stern of the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad,\xe2\x80\x9d thus\r\nnecessitating a raid into one of the islands, where some of the natives\r\nare killed, and some houses burned, but the boat recovered.\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 1521, the first of the Philippines (by them called the\r\narchipelago of San Lazaro) to be seen by Europeans, is sighted. Anchor\r\nis cast at a small desert island called Humunu, (but which the mariners\r\ncall \xe2\x80\x9cThe watering-place of good signs\xe2\x80\x9d because the first traces of\r\ngold are found there), near Samar, where two tents are quickly set up\r\nfor the sick, whom Magalh\xc3\xa3es himself tends with solicitude. March 18,\r\nthey gain their first acquaintance with the natives, who prove\r\nhospitable, and promise fresh provisions. These are brought on the\r\ntwenty-second of March, and the Europeans have their first sight of a\r\ntattooed Visayan chief, who, as well as his men, is decked out in gold\r\nornaments. After a week\xe2\x80\x99s stay, the ships again set sail, Pigafetta\r\nalmost coming to an untimely end by slipping over the side of the\r\nvessel while fishing, but happily saved by the aid of \xe2\x80\x9cthat fount of\r\nmercy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Virgin.\r\n\r\nMarch 28, anchor is cast at the island of Limasaua (Mazava), where\r\nEnrique, the Malaccan slave of Magalh\xc3\xa3es, serves as interpreter.\r\nAmicable relations are speedily entered into and confirmed by the\r\nMalayan rite of blood brotherhood. The king of Limasaua, and his\r\nbrother, the king of certain districts in Mindanao, prove most helpful,\r\nand are completely won over by a judicious presentation of gifts.\r\nGreatly are the natives impressed by the power of the new comers, as\r\nseen in the artillery and armor, and their astonishment is increased\r\nwhen Magalh\xc3\xa3es relates his course to their islands and the discovery\r\nof the strait.\r\n\r\nOn Good Friday, Pigafetta and a companion visit the natives ashore,\r\nwhere they spend the night in the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace, a typical Visayan\r\nhouse raised aloft on supports and thatched with nipa. Here the various\r\nceremonies that he witnesses impress Pigafetta, and his companion, cast\r\nin coarser mould than he, becomes intoxicated. Pigafetta, always\r\ninterested in the language of the new peoples whom he meets, writes\r\ndown certain of their words, whereat they are greatly astonished. He\r\nrecords that he \xe2\x80\x9cate meat on Holy Friday, for I could not help\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d On Easter Sunday, the natives are deeply impressed by the\r\nmass that is celebrated ashore, and the cross which is planted in the\r\nhighest part of the island, and which they promise to adore.\r\n\r\nThe limited amount of food in Limasaua, which is used only as a place\r\nof recreation by the two kings, who go there to visit one another and\r\nhunt, leads Magalh\xc3\xa3es to seek a more abundant harbor. Among the places\r\npointed out where food is abundant is the island of Ceb\xc3\xba, and there\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es determines to go, \xe2\x80\x9cfor so did his unhappy fate will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter a seven days\xe2\x80\x99 stay at Limasaua, the course is laid to Ceb\xc3\xba\r\nunder the pilotage of the king of Limasaua, who is finally taken aboard\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad\xe2\x80\x9d as his vessel is unable to keep up with the\r\nswifter-moving European vessels. Entering the port of Ceb\xc3\xba on April 7,\r\namid the thunder of their guns, the settlement is thrown into\r\nconsternation, but the Malaccan being sent ashore reassures them of his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s good intentions, whom he proclaims to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccaptain of the\r\ngreatest king and prince in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cwas going to discover\r\nMalucho,\xe2\x80\x9d but hearing of the great fame of the king of Ceb\xc3\xba, wishes\r\ntrade with him. The king of Ceb\xc3\xba is willing to accord friendship to\r\nthe Europeans, but asks a tribute, as it is the custom for all visitors\r\nto pay it to him. But no tribute will be paid him, asserts Enrique, and\r\nthe king, at the advice of a Moro merchant who has heard of the deeds\r\nof the Portuguese along Malacca and the Indian coast, and confuses the\r\nstrangers with them, until undeceived by Enrique (who declares them to\r\nbe much greater than the Portuguese), expresses his willingness to make\r\nfriendship with Magalh\xc3\xa3es. With the help of the friendly king of\r\nLimasaua, peace is made according to Malay rites, and gifts exchanged.\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es, deeply religious, in common with many of his age, early\r\nseeks to lure the natives of Ceb\xc3\xba to holy baptism, by presenting to\r\nthem its most attractive side, and promising the king if he becomes a\r\nChristian, a suit of armor; but they must become willing converts, and\r\nnot for the hope of gain or for fear. The peace is more firmly cemented\r\nby the visit of Pigafetta and a companion to the king, where they\r\nwitness ceremonies similar to those of Limasaua, and where gifts are\r\nbestowed upon the king and some others. They also visit the house of\r\nthe prince apparent, where they hear their first concert of Visayan\r\nmusic and see a native dance. On the following Wednesday two of the\r\ncrew are buried ashore on consecrated ground with as much pomp as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nTrading is instituted by carrying a quantity of merchandise ashore, the\r\nsafety of which is assured by the king. Those people are found to have\r\nweights and measures for their trading; and besides their gongs, a\r\nflute-like instrument. Their houses are entered by ladders. On Friday\r\nbegins the trading, gold being given for metals and large articles, and\r\nfood for the smaller wares. The good bargains obtained by the\r\nEuropeans, would have been materially less and the trade spoiled\r\nforever had it not been for Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s watchfulness, for so eager\r\nare the men at the sight of the gold, that they would have given almost\r\nanything for it. On the following Sunday, the king and his chief men,\r\nand the queen and many women, are baptized and given European names,\r\nand ere the week closes all the Cebuans have become Christians, as well\r\nas some from neighboring islands. The queen at her earnest request, is\r\ngiven a small image of the Christ child, the same afterward recovered\r\nby Legazpi, and still held in the greatest of reverence at Ceb\xc3\xba. The\r\nopposition of certain chiefs to the king of Ceb\xc3\xba is satisfactorily\r\nended by the inducements and threats of Magalh\xc3\xa3es. The latter swears\r\nto be faithful in his friendship with the natives, who likewise swear\r\nallegiance to the king of Spain. However, the natives are loath to\r\ndestroy their idols, according to their promise, and Magalh\xc3\xa3es finds\r\nthem still sacrificing to them for the cure of sickness. Substituting\r\ntherefore the assurance that the new faith will work a cure, in lieu of\r\nwhich he offers his head, the sick man (who is the prince\xe2\x80\x99s brother\r\nand the bravest and wisest man in the island) is miraculously cured.\r\nThereupon many idols are burned amid great demonstrations. Vivid\r\ndescriptions are given of the people and their customs and ceremonies,\r\nespecially those of sacrifice and mourning.\r\n\r\nApril 20, a chief from the neighboring island of Mactan sends a small\r\npresent to Magalh\xc3\xa3es, with the request to aid him with a boat load of\r\nmen against the chief Cilapulapu, who refuses allegiance to Spain.\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es in his ardor, and notwithstanding the remonstrances of his\r\nfriends, leads three boat loads of men (sixty in all) to the island,\r\nwhere having ordered the king of Ceb\xc3\xba to be a witness of the battle\r\nonly, he engages the natives. Disastrous indeed does that day prove,\r\nfor beset by multitudes of foes, the Europeans are compelled to\r\nretreat, and the retreat becomes a rout, the personal bravery of\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es and a few of his closest friends only saving the men from\r\nalmost complete massacre. Recognizing the leader, the natives make\r\ntheir greatest efforts against him, and finally he is killed while knee\r\ndeep in the water, but after all the others are saved. Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlament is tragic and sorrowful; they \xe2\x80\x9ckilled our mirror, our light,\r\nour comfort, and our true guide.\xe2\x80\x9d Insolent in their victory, the\r\nnatives refuse to give up the body of the slain leader at the request\r\nof the king of Ceb\xc3\xba. The Europeans stunned by the loss of their\r\nleader, withdraw their merchandise and guards to the ship, and make\r\npreparations for departure. Duarte Barbosa and Jo\xc3\xa3o de Serr\xc3\xa3o are\r\nchosen leaders. The second act in the drama follows speedily. The slave\r\nEnrique, enraged at a severe reprimand and threats by Barbosa,\r\nconspires with the king of Ceb\xc3\xba; with the result that twenty-six men,\r\nincluding both of the leaders, are murdered at a banquet on May 1, to\r\nwhich the king invites them. Jo\xc3\xa3o Carvalho, deaf to the entreaties of\r\nJo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o, his comrade, and anxious to become leader, sails away\r\nleaving him to his death. Pigafetta names the products of Ceb\xc3\xba, and\r\ngives a valuable vocabulary of Visayan words, most of which are still\r\nin use by those people.\r\n\r\nBy mutual consent, the three vessels proceed to Bohol, where the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConcepcion\xe2\x80\x9d is burned, as there are too few men left to work all\r\nthree ships; although its supplies and all else possible are\r\ntransferred to the \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, cruising\r\nalong, they put in at Mindanao where Pigafetta goes ashore alone, after\r\nthe king has made blood friendship at the ships. There they hear of\r\nLuz\xc3\xb3n, where the Chinese trade annually. Departing from Mindanao, they\r\nanchor at Cagayan Sulu, a penal settlement for Borneo, where the\r\nblowpipe and poisoned arrows are used, and the daggers adorned with\r\ngold. The next anchorage is at Paragua, although before reaching that\r\nisland, the men have been tempted to abandon the ships because of\r\nhunger. There the rice is cooked under the fire in bamboos and is\r\nbetter than that cooked in earthen pots. Those people raise fighting\r\ncocks and bet on their favorite birds. Ten leagues from Paragua is the\r\ngreat island of Borneo, whither the ships next go, and anchor at the\r\ncity of Brunei, which is built over the water, and contains twenty-five\r\nthousand fires. Hospitably received by eight chiefs who visit the\r\nships, they enter into relations with the Borneans. Seven men go as\r\nambassadors to visit the king, and bear presents to him and the chief\r\nmen. Here some of the grandeurs of an oriental court are spread before\r\ntheir eyes, which Pigafetta briefly describes. The strangers are\r\ngraciously given permission to take on fresh supplies of food, water,\r\nand wood, and to trade at pleasure. Later actions of the Borneans cause\r\nthe men of the ships to fear treachery, and forestalling any action by\r\nthat people, they attack a number of junks near them, and capture four.\r\nAmong the captives is the son of the king of Luz\xc3\xb3n, who is the chief\r\ncaptain in Borneo, and whom Carvalho allows to escape, without\r\nconsulting the others, for a large sum of gold. His action in so doing\r\nreacts on himself, for the king refuses to allow two men who were\r\nashore and Carvalho\xe2\x80\x99s own son (born of a native woman in Brazil) to\r\nreturn to the ships, and they are left behind. The Borneans and their\r\njunks are described. They use porcelain dishes which are made from a\r\nfine white clay that is buried under ground for fifty years in order to\r\nrefine it, and inherited from father to son. Camphor is obtained there,\r\nand the island is so large that it can be circumnavigated by a prau\r\nonly in three months\xe2\x80\x99 time.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Borneo, a number of prisoners from the captured junks are\r\nkept, among them three women whom Carvalho ostensibly retains as\r\npresents for the queen of Spain, but in reality for himself. Happily\r\nescaping from the point on which one of the ships has become grounded,\r\nand the fear of explosion from a candle which is snuffed into a barrel\r\nof powder, the ships anchor at a point of Borneo, where for forty-two\r\ndays, the men are busied in repairing, calking, and furnishing the\r\nvessels. The journey is resumed back toward Paragua, the governor of a\r\ndistrict of that island being captured on the way; with whom, however,\r\nthey enter into friendly relations. Thence the ships cruise along\r\nbetween Cagayan, Jol\xc3\xb3, and Mindanao, capturing a native boat from\r\nMaingdanao of the latter island, from the captive occupants of which\r\nthey learn news of the Moluccas. Pushing on amid stormy weather, they\r\nanchor at the island of Sarangani, just south of Mindanao; and thence\r\nproceed in a generally southerly direction amid many islands until the\r\nMoluccas are reached, and they enter the harbor of Tidore on Friday,\r\nNovember 8, 1521, after twenty-seven months, less two days, since their\r\ndeparture from Spain.\r\n\r\nAt Tidore a warm welcome awaits them from the king, who is a powerful\r\nastrologer and has been expecting their arrival. He promises them as\r\nmany cloves as they wish, even offering to go outside his island,\r\ncontrary to the practice of kings, to provide them the sooner; in\r\nreturn for his services hoping for their aid in his designs for power\r\nin the Moluccas, especially against the king of Ternate. There they\r\nlearn that Francisco Serr\xc3\xa3o, the great friend of Magalh\xc3\xa3es, has\r\nperished some eight months previously from poison administered by the\r\nking of Tidore, whom he had visited, because he had aided the king of\r\nTernate against Tidore. This Serr\xc3\xa3o, says Pigafetta, was the cause of\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es undertaking his expedition, and he had been in the Moluccas\r\nfor ten years, for so long ago had Portugal discovered those islands.\r\nThe efforts of the Ternatans to gain the new strangers fail, for they\r\nare already pledged to the king of Tidore. On November 12, a house is\r\nbuilt ashore and on the thirteenth the merchandise is carried there,\r\namong it being that captured with the various junks at and near Borneo.\r\nThe sailors are somewhat careless of their bargains for they are in\r\nhaste to return to Spain. The king continues his kindness, and to humor\r\nhim, as he is a Mahometan, all the swine in the boats are killed. This\r\nrelation will be concluded in Vol. XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Editors\r\n\r\n    December, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMO VIAGGIO INTORNO AL MONDO\r\n\r\nBy Antonio Pigafetta.

[4]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as, most illustrious and excellent Lord, there are many\r\ncurious persons who not only take pleasure in knowing and hearing the\r\ngreat and wonderful things which God has permitted me to see and suffer\r\nduring my long and dangerous voyage, hereto appended, but who also wish\r\nto know the means and manners and paths that I have taken in making\r\nthat voyage [literally: \xe2\x80\x9cin going thither\xe2\x80\x9d]; and who do not lend\r\nthat entire faith to the end unless they have a perfect assurance of\r\nthe beginning: therefore, your most illustrious Lordship must know\r\nthat, finding myself, in the year of the nativity of our Savior\r\nMCCCCCXIX in Spagnia, in the court of the most serene king of the\r\nRomans, [5] with the reverend Monsignor, Francesco Chieregato, then\r\napostolic protonotary and nuncio of Pope Leo X of holy memory (and who\r\nhas since become bishop of Aprutino and prince of Teramo), [6] and\r\nhaving learned many things from many books that I had read, as well as\r\nfrom various persons, [7] who discussed the great and marvelous things\r\nof the Ocean Sea with his Lordship, I determined, by the good favor of\r\nhis C\xc3\xa6sarean Majesty, and of his Lordship abovesaid, to experience and\r\nto go to see those things for myself, so that I might be able thereby\r\nto satisfy myself somewhat, and so that I might be able to gain some\r\nrenown for later posterity. [8] Having heard that a fleet composed of\r\nfive vessels had been fitted out in the city of Siviglia for the\r\npurpose of going to discover the spicery in the islands of Maluco,\r\nunder command of Captain-general Fernando de Magaglianes, [9] a\r\nPortuguese gentleman, comendador of the [Order of] Santo Jacobo de la\r\nSpada [i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cSt. James of the Sword\xe2\x80\x9d], [10] [who] had many times\r\ntraversed the Ocean Sea in various directions, whence he had acquired\r\ngreat praise, I set out from the city of Barsalonna, where his Majesty\r\nwas then residing, bearing many letters in my favor. I went by ship as\r\nfar as Malega, where, taking the highroad, I went overland to Siviglia.\r\nHaving been there about three full months, waiting for the said fleet\r\nto be set in order for the departure, [11] finally, as your most\r\nexcellent Lordship will learn below, we commenced our voyage under most\r\nhappy auspices. And inasmuch as when I was in Ytalia and going to see\r\nhis Holiness, Pope Clement, [12] you by your grace showed yourself very\r\nkind and good to me at Monteroso, and told me that you would be greatly\r\npleased if I would write down for you all those things which I had seen\r\nand suffered during my voyage; and although I have had little\r\nopportunity, yet I have tried to satisfy your desire according to my\r\npoor ability; therefore, I offer you, in this little book of mine, all\r\nmy vigils, hardships, and wanderings, begging you, although you are\r\nbusied with continual Rhodian cares, to deign to skim through it, by\r\nwhich I shall be enabled to receive a not slight remuneration from your\r\nmost illustrious Lordship, to whose good favor I consign and commend\r\nmyself. [13]\r\n\r\nThe captain-general having resolved to make so long a voyage through\r\nthe Ocean Sea, where furious winds and great storms are always\r\nreigning, but not desiring to make known to any of his men the voyage\r\nthat he was about to make, so that they might not be cast down at the\r\nthought of doing so great and extraordinary a deed, as he did\r\naccomplish with the aid of God (the captains who accompanied him, hated\r\nhim exceedingly, I know not why, unless because he was a Portuguese,\r\nand they Spaniards), with the desire to conclude what he promised under\r\noath to the emperor, Don Carlo, king of Spagnia, prescribed the\r\nfollowing orders and gave them to all the pilots and masters of his\r\nships, so that the ships might not become separated from one another\r\nduring the storms and night. [14] These were [to the effect] that he\r\nwould always precede the other ships at night, and they were to follow\r\nhis ship which would have a large torch of wood, which they call farol.\r\n[15] He always carried that farol set at the poop of his ship as a\r\nsignal so that they might always follow him. Another light was made by\r\nmeans of a lantern or by means of a piece of wicking made from a rush\r\nand called sparto rope [16] which is well beaten in the water, and then\r\ndried in the sun or in the smoke\xe2\x80\x94a most excellent material for such\r\nuse. They were to answer him so that he might know by that signal\r\nwhether all of the ships were coming together. If he showed two lights\r\nbesides that of the farol, they were to veer or take another tack,\r\n[doing this] when the wind was not favorable or suitable for us to\r\ncontinue on our way, or when he wished to sail slowly. If he showed\r\nthree lights, they were to lower away the bonnet-sail, which is a part\r\nof the sail that is fastened below the mainsail, when the weather is\r\nsuitable for making better time. It is lowered so that it may be easier\r\nto furl the mainsail when it is struck hastily during a sudden squall.\r\n[17] If he showed four lights, they were to strike all the sails; [18]\r\nafter which he showed a signal by one light, [which meant] that he was\r\nstanding still. If he showed a greater number of lights, or fired a\r\nmortar, it was a signal of land or of shoals. [19] Then he showed four\r\nlights when he wished to have the sails set full, so that they might\r\nalways sail in his wake by the torch on the poop. When he desired to\r\nset the bonnet-sail, he showed three lights. [20] When he desired to\r\nalter his course, he showed two; [21] and then if he wished to\r\nascertain whether all the ships were following and whether they were\r\ncoming together, he showed one light, so that each one of the ships\r\nmight do the same and reply to him. Three watches were set nightly: the\r\nfirst at the beginning of the night; the second, which is called the\r\nmidnight, [22] and the third at the end [of the night]. All of the men\r\nin the ships were divided into three parts: the first was the division\r\nof the captain or boatswain, those two alternating nightly; the second,\r\nof either the pilot or boatswain\xe2\x80\x99s mate; and the third, of the\r\nmaster. [23] Thus did the captain-general order that all the ships\r\nobserve the above signals and watches, so that their voyage might be\r\nmore propitious. [24]\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, August x, St. Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s day, in the year\r\nabovesaid, the fleet, having been supplied with all the things\r\nnecessary for the sea, [25] (and counting those of every nationality,\r\nwe were two hundred and thirty-seven men), made ready to leave the\r\nharbor of Siviglia. [26] Discharging many pieces of artillery, the\r\nships held their forestaysails to the wind, and descended the river\r\nBetis, at present called Gadalcavir, passing by a village called Gioan\r\ndal Farax, once a large Moorish settlement. In the midst of it was once\r\na bridge that crossed the said river, and led to Siviglia. Two columns\r\nof that bridge have remained even to this day at the bottom of the\r\nwater, and when ships sail by there, they need men who know the\r\nlocation of the columns thoroughly, so that the ships may not strike\r\nagainst them. They must also be passed when the river is highest with\r\nthe tide; as must also many other villages along the river, which has\r\nnot sufficient depth [of itself] for ships that are laden and which are\r\nnot very large to pass. Then the ships reached another village called\r\nCoria, and passed by many other villages along the river, until they\r\ncame to a castle of the duke of Medina Cidonia, called San Lucar, which\r\nis a port by which to enter the Ocean Sea. [27] It is in an east and\r\nwest direction with the cape of Sanct Vincent, which lies in 37 degrees\r\nof latitude, and x leguas from the said port. [28] From Siviglia to\r\nthis point [i.e., San Lucar], it is 17 or 20 leguas by river. [29] Some\r\ndays after, the captain-general, with his other captains, descended the\r\nriver in the small boats belonging to their ships. We remained there\r\nfor a considerable number of days in order to finish [30] [providing]\r\nthe fleet with some things that it needed. Every day we went ashore to\r\nhear mass in a village called Nostra Dona de Baremeda [our Lady of\r\nBarrameda], near San Lucar. Before the departure, the captain-general\r\nwished all the men to confess, and would not allow any [31] woman to\r\nsail in the fleet for the best of considerations.\r\n\r\nWe left that village, by name San Luchar, on Tuesday, September xx of\r\nthe same year, and took a southwest course. [32] On the 26th [33] of\r\nthe said month, we reached an island of the Great Canaria, called\r\nTeneriphe, which lies in a latitude of 28 degrees, [landing there] in\r\norder to get flesh, water, and wood. [34] We stayed there for three and\r\none-half days in order to furnish the fleet with the said supplies.\r\nThen we went to a port of the same island called Monte Rosso [35] to\r\nget pitch, [36] staying [there] two days. Your most illustrious\r\nLordship must know that there is a particular one of the islands of the\r\nGreat Canaria, where one can not find a single drop of water which\r\ngushes up [from a spring]; [37] but that at noontide a cloud descends\r\nfrom the sky and encircles a large tree which grows in the said island,\r\nthe leaves and branches of which distil a quantity of water. At the\r\nfoot of the said tree runs a trench which resembles a spring, where all\r\nthe water falls, and from which the people living there, and the\r\nanimals, both domestic and wild, fully satisfy themselves daily with\r\nthis water and no other. [38]\r\n\r\nAt midnight of Monday, October three, the sails were trimmed toward the\r\nsouth, [39] and we took to the open Ocean Sea, passing between Cape\r\nVerde and its islands in 14 and one-half degrees. Thus for many days\r\ndid we sail along the coast of Ghinea, or Ethiopia, where there is a\r\nmountain called Siera Leona, which lies in 8 degrees of latitude, with\r\ncontrary winds, calms, and rains without wind, until we reached the\r\nequinoctial line, having sixty days of continual rain. [40] Contrary to\r\nthe opinion of the ancients, [41] before we reached the line many\r\nfurious squalls of wind, and currents of water struck us head on in 14\r\ndegrees. As we could not advance, and in order that the ships might not\r\nbe wrecked, [42] all the sails were struck; and in this manner did we\r\nwander hither and yon on the sea, waiting for the tempest to cease, for\r\nit was very furious. [43] When it rained there was no wind. When the\r\nsun shone, it was calm. Certain large fishes called tiburoni [i.e.,\r\nsharks] came to the side of the ships. They have terrible teeth, and\r\nwhenever they find men in the sea they devour them. We caught many of\r\nthem with iron hooks, [44] although they are not good to eat unless\r\nthey are small, and even then they are not very good. During those\r\nstorms the holy body, that is to say St. Elmo, appeared to us many\r\ntimes, in light\xe2\x80\x94among other times on an exceedingly dark night, [45]\r\nwith the brightness of a blazing torch, on the maintop, where he stayed\r\nfor about two hours or more, to our consolation, for we were weeping.\r\nWhen that blessed light was about to leave us, so dazzling was the\r\nbrightness that it cast into our eyes, that we all remained for more\r\nthan an eighth of an hour [46] blinded and calling for mercy. And truly\r\nwhen we thought that we were dead men, the sea suddenly grew calm. [47]\r\n\r\nI saw many kinds of birds, among them one that had no anus; and\r\nanother, [which] when the female wishes to lay its eggs, it does so on\r\nthe back of the male and there they are hatched. The latter bird has no\r\nfeet, and always lives in the sea. [There is] another kind which live\r\non the ordure of the other birds, and in no other manner; for I often\r\nsaw this bird, which is called Cagassela, fly behind the other birds,\r\nuntil they are constrained to drop their ordure, which the former\r\nseizes immediately and abandons the latter bird. I also saw many flying\r\nfish, and many others collected together, so that they resembled an\r\nisland. [48]\r\n\r\nAfter we had passed the equinoctial line going south, we lost the north\r\nstar, and hence we sailed south south-west [49] until [we reached] a\r\nland called the land of Verzin [50] which lies in 23\xc2\xbd degrees of the\r\nAntarctic Pole [i.e., south latitude]. It is the land extending from\r\nthe cape of Santo Augustino, which lies in 8 degrees of the same pole.\r\nThere we got a plentiful refreshment of fowls, potatoes [batate], many\r\nsweet pine-apples\xe2\x80\x94in truth the most delicious fruit that can be\r\nfound\xe2\x80\x94the flesh of the anta, [51] which resembles beef, sugarcane,\r\nand innumerable other things, which I shall not mention in order not to\r\nbe prolix. For one fishhook or one knife, those people gave 5 or 6\r\nchickens; for one comb, a brace of geese; for one mirror or one pair of\r\nscissors, as many fish as would be sufficient for x men; for a bell or\r\none leather lace, one basketful of potatoes [batate]. These potatoes\r\nresemble chestnuts in taste, and are as long as turnips. [52] For a\r\nking of diamonds [danari], [53] which is a playing card, they gave me 6\r\n[54] fowls and thought that they had even cheated me. We entered that\r\nport on St. Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s day, and on that day had the sun on the zenith;\r\n[55] and we were subjected to greater heat on that day and on the other\r\ndays when we had the sun on the zenith, than when we were under the\r\nequinoctial line. [56]\r\n\r\nThat land of Verzin is wealthier and larger than Spagnia, Fransa, and\r\nItalia, [57] put together, and belongs to the king of Portugalo. The\r\npeople of that land are not Christians, and have no manner of worship.\r\nThey live according to the dictates of nature, [58] and reach an age of\r\none hundred and twenty-five and one hundred and forty years. [59] They\r\ngo naked, both men and women. They live in certain long houses which\r\nthey call boii [60] and sleep in cotton hammocks called amache, which\r\nare fastened in those houses by each end to large beams. A fire is\r\nbuilt on the ground under those hammocks. In each one of those boii,\r\nthere are one hundred men with their wives and children, [61] and they\r\nmake a great racket. They have boats called canoes made of one single\r\nhuge tree, [62] hollowed out by the use of stone hatchets. Those people\r\nemploy stones as we do iron, as they have no iron. Thirty or forty men\r\noccupy one of those boats. They paddle with blades like the shovels of\r\na furnace, and thus, black, naked, and shaven, they resemble, when\r\npaddling, the inhabitants of the Stygian marsh. [63] Men and women are\r\nas well proportioned as we. They eat the human flesh of their enemies,\r\nnot because it is good, but because it is a certain established custom.\r\nThat custom, which is mutual, was begun by an old woman, [64] who had\r\nbut one son who was killed by his enemies. In return some days later,\r\nthat old woman\xe2\x80\x99s friends captured one of the company who had killed\r\nher son, and brought him to the place of her abode. She seeing him, and\r\nremembering her son, ran upon him like an infuriated bitch, and bit him\r\non one shoulder. Shortly afterward he escaped to his own people, whom\r\nhe told that they had tried to eat him, showing them [in proof] the\r\nmarks on his shoulder. Whomever the latter captured afterward at any\r\ntime from the former they ate, and the former did the same to the\r\nlatter, so that such a custom has sprung up in this way. They do not\r\neat the bodies all at once, but every one cuts off a piece, and carries\r\nit to his house, where he smokes it. Then every week, [65] he cuts off\r\na small bit, which he eats thus smoked with his other food to remind\r\nhim of his enemies. The above was told me by the pilot, Johane\r\nCarnagio, [66] who came with us, and who had lived in that land for\r\nfour years. Those people paint the whole body and the face in a\r\nwonderful manner with fire in various fashions, as do the women also.\r\nThe men are [are: doublet in original manuscript] smooth shaven and\r\nhave no beard, for they pull it out. They clothe themselves in a dress\r\nmade of parrot feathers, with large round arrangements at their\r\nbuttocks made from the largest feathers, and it is a ridiculous sight.\r\nAlmost all the people, except the women and children, [67] have three\r\nholes pierced in the lower lip, where they carry round stones, one\r\nfinger or thereabouts in length and hanging down outside. Those people\r\nare not entirely black, but of a dark brown color. They keep the\r\nprivies uncovered, and the body is without hair, [68] while both men\r\nand women always go naked. Their king is called cacich [i.e., cacique].\r\nThey have an infinite number of parrots, and gave us 8 or 10 for one\r\nmirror: and little monkeys that look like lions, only [they are]\r\nyellow, and very beautiful. [69] They make round white [loaves of]\r\nbread from the marrowy substance of trees, which is not very good, and\r\nis found between the wood and the bark and resembles buttermilk curds.\r\n[70] They have swine which have their navels [lombelico] on their\r\nbacks, [71] and large birds with beaks like spoons and no tongues. [72]\r\nThe men gave us one or two of their young daughters as slaves for one\r\nhatchet or one large knife, but they would not give us their wives in\r\nexchange for anything at all. The women will not shame their husbands\r\nunder any considerations whatever, and as was told us, refuse to\r\nconsent to their husbands by day, but only by night. [73] The women\r\ncultivate the fields, and carry all their food from the mountains in\r\npanniers or baskets on the head or fastened to the head. [74] But they\r\nare always accompanied by their husbands, who are armed only with a bow\r\nof brazil-wood or of black palm-wood, and a bundle of cane arrows,\r\ndoing this because they are jealous [of their wives]. The women carry\r\ntheir children hanging in a cotton net from their necks. I omit other\r\nparticulars, in order not to be tedious. Mass was said twice on shore,\r\nduring which those people remained on their knees with so great\r\ncontrition and with clasped hands raised aloft, that it was an\r\nexceeding great pleasure [75] to behold them. They built us a house as\r\nthey thought that we were going to stay with them for some time, and at\r\nour departure they cut a great quantity of brazil-wood [verzin] to give\r\nus. [76] It had been about two months since it had rained in that land,\r\nand when we reached that port, it happened to rain, whereupon they said\r\nthat we came from the sky and that we had brought the rain with us.\r\n[77] Those people could be converted easily to the faith of Jesus\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nAt first those people thought that the small boats were the children of\r\nthe ships, and that the latter gave birth to them when they were\r\nlowered into the sea from the ships, and when they were lying so\r\nalongside the ships (as is the custom), they believed that the ships\r\nwere nursing them. [78] One day a beautiful young woman came to the\r\nflagship, where I was, for no other purpose than to seek what chance\r\nmight offer. While there and waiting, she cast her eyes upon the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s room, and saw a nail longer than one\xe2\x80\x99s finger. Picking it\r\nup very delightedly and neatly, she thrust it through the lips of her\r\nvagina [natura], and bending down low immediately departed, the\r\ncaptain-general and I having seen that action. [79]\r\n\r\nSome words of those people of Verzin [80]\r\n\r\n\r\n             For Millet     maiz\r\n             for Flour      hui\r\n             for Fishhook   pinda\r\n             for Knife      tacse\r\n             for Comb       chigap\r\n             for Scissors   pirame\r\n             for Bell       itanmaraca\r\n             Good, better   tum maragathum\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remained in that land for 13 days. Then proceeding, on our way, we\r\nwent as far as 34 and one-third degrees [81] toward the Antarctic Pole,\r\nwhere we found people at a freshwater river, called Canibali [i.e.,\r\ncannibals], who eat human flesh. One of them, in stature almost a\r\ngiant, came to the flagship in order to assure [the safety of] the\r\nothers his friends. [82] He had a voice like a bull. While he was in\r\nthe ship, the others carried away their possessions from the place\r\nwhere they were living into the interior, for fear of us. Seeing that,\r\nwe landed one hundred men in order to have speech and converse with\r\nthem, or to capture one of them by force. They fled, and in fleeing\r\nthey took so large a step that we although running could not gain on\r\ntheir steps. There are seven islands in that river, in the largest of\r\nwhich precious gems are found. That place is called the cape of Santa\r\nMaria, and it was formerly thought that one passed thence to the sea of\r\nSur, that is to say the South Sea, but nothing further was ever\r\ndiscovered. Now the name is not [given to] a cape, but [to] a river,\r\nwith a mouth 17 leguas in width. [83] A Spanish captain, called Johan\r\nde Solis and sixty men, who were going to discover lands like us, were\r\nformerly eaten at that river by those cannibals because of too great\r\nconfidence. [84]\r\n\r\nThen proceeding on the same course toward the Antarctic Pole, coasting\r\nalong the land, we came to anchor at two islands full of geese and\r\nsea-wolves. [85] Truly, the great number of those geese cannot be\r\nreckoned; in one hour we loaded the five ships [with them]. Those geese\r\nare black and have all their feathers alike both on body and wings.\r\nThey do not fly, and live on fish. They were so fat that it was not\r\nnecessary to pluck them but to skin them. Their beak is like that of a\r\ncrow. Those sea-wolves are of various colors, and as large as a calf,\r\nwith a head like that of a calf, ears small and round, and large teeth.\r\nThey have no legs but only feet with small nails attached to the body,\r\nwhich resemble our hands, and between their fingers the same kind of\r\nskin as the geese. They would be very fierce if they could run. They\r\nswim, and live on fish. At that place the ships suffered a very great\r\nstorm, during which the three holy bodies appeared to us many times,\r\nthat is to say, St. Elmo, St. Nicholas, and St. Clara, whereupon the\r\nstorm quickly ceased.\r\n\r\nLeaving that place, we finally reached 49 and one-half degrees toward\r\nthe Antarctic Pole. As it was winter, the ships entered a safe port to\r\nwinter. [86] We passed two months in that place without seeing anyone.\r\nOne day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the shore of\r\nthe port, dancing, [87] singing, and throwing dust on his head. The\r\ncaptain-general sent one of our men to the giant so that he might\r\nperform the same, actions as a sign of peace. Having done that, the man\r\nled the giant to an islet into the presence of the captain-general.\r\nWhen the giant was in the captain-general\xe2\x80\x99s and our presence, he\r\nmarveled greatly, [88] and made signs with one finger raised upward,\r\nbelieving that we had come from the sky. He was so tall that we reached\r\nonly to his waist, and he was well proportioned. His face was large and\r\npainted red all over while about his eyes he was painted yellow; and he\r\nhad two hearts painted on the middle of his cheeks. His scanty hair was\r\npainted white. [89] He was dressed in the skins of animals skilfully\r\nsewn together. That animal has a head and ears as large as those of a\r\nmule, a neck and body like those of a camel, the legs of a deer, and\r\nthe tail of a horse, like which it neighs, and that land has very many\r\nof them. [90] His feet were shod with the same kind of skins which\r\ncovered his feet in the manner of shoes. [91] In his hand he carried a\r\nshort, heavy bow, with a cord somewhat thicker than those of the lute,\r\n[92] and made from the intestines of the same animal, and a bundle of\r\nrather short cane arrows feathered like ours, and with points of white\r\nand black flint stones in the manner of Turkish arrows, instead of\r\niron. Those points were fashioned by means of another stone. [93] The\r\ncaptain-general had the giant given something to eat and drink, and\r\namong other things which were shown to him was a large steel mirror.\r\nWhen he saw his face, he was greatly terrified, and jumped back\r\nthrowing three or four [94] of our men to the ground. After that he was\r\ngiven some bells, a mirror, a comb, and certain Pater Nosters. The\r\ncaptain-general sent him ashore with 4 armed men. When one of his\r\ncompanions, who would never come to the ships, saw him coming with our\r\nmen, he ran to the place where the others were, who came [down to the\r\nshore] all naked one after the other. When our men reached them, they\r\nbegan to dance and to sing, lifting one finger to the sky. They showed\r\nour men some white powder made from the roots of an herb, which they\r\nkept in earthen pots, and which they ate because they had nothing else.\r\nOur men made signs inviting them to the ships, and that they would help\r\nthem carry their possessions. Thereupon, those men quickly took only\r\ntheir bows, while their women laden like asses carried everything. The\r\nlatter are not so tall as the men but are very much fatter. When we saw\r\nthem we were greatly surprised. Their breasts are one-half braza long,\r\nand they are painted and clothed like their husbands, except that\r\nbefore their privies [natura] they have a small skin which covers them.\r\nThey led four of those young animals, fastened with thongs like a\r\nhalter. When those people wish to catch some of those animals, they tie\r\none of these young ones to a thornbush. Thereupon, the large ones come\r\nto play with the little ones; and those people kill them with their\r\narrows from their place of concealment. Our men led eighteen of those\r\npeople, counting men and women, to the ships, and they were distributed\r\non the two sides of the port so that they might catch some of the said\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nSix days after the above, a giant painted [95] and clothed in the same\r\nmanner was seen by some [of our men] who were cutting wood. He had a\r\nbow and arrows in his hand. When our men approached him, he first\r\ntouched his head, face, [96] and body, and then did the same to our\r\nmen, afterward lifting his hands toward the sky. When the\r\ncaptain-general was informed of it, he ordered him to be brought in the\r\nsmall boat. He was taken to that island in the port where our men had\r\nbuilt a house for the smiths [97] and for the storage of some things\r\nfrom the ships. That man was even taller and better built than the\r\nothers and as tractable and amiable. Jumping up and down, he danced,\r\nand when he danced, at every leap, his feet sank a palmo into the\r\nearth. He remained with us for a considerable number of days, so long\r\nthat we baptized him, calling him Johanni. He uttered [the words]\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesu,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPater Noster,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAve Maria\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cJovani\xe2\x80\x9d [i.e.,\r\nJohn97 as distinctly as we, but with an exceedingly loud voice. Then\r\nthe captain-general gave him a shirt, a woolen jerkin [camisota de\r\npanno], cloth breeches, a cap, a mirror, a comb, bells, and other\r\nthings, and sent him away like his companions. He left us very joyous\r\nand happy. The following day he brought one of those large animals to\r\nthe captain-general, in return for which many things were given to him,\r\nso that he might bring some more to us; but we did not see him again.\r\nWe thought that his companions had killed him because he had conversed\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later we saw four of those giants without their arms for\r\nthey had hidden them in certain bushes as the two whom we captured\r\nshowed us. Each one was painted differently. The captain-general kept\r\ntwo of them\xe2\x80\x94the youngest and best proportioned\xe2\x80\x94by means of a very\r\ncunning trick, in order to take them to Spagnia. [98] Had he used any\r\nother means [than those he employed], they could easily have killed\r\nsome of us. [99] The trick that he employed in keeping them was as\r\nfollows. He gave them many knives, scissors, mirrors, bells, and glass\r\nbeads; and those two having their hands filled with the said articles,\r\nthe captain-general had two pairs of iron manacles brought, such as are\r\nfastened on the feet. [100] He made motions that he would give them to\r\nthe giants, whereat they were very pleased since those manacles were of\r\niron, but they did not know how to carry them. They were grieved at\r\nleaving them behind, but they had no place to put those gifts; for they\r\nhad to hold the skin wrapped about them with their hands. [101] The\r\nother two giants wished to help them, but the captain refused. Seeing\r\nthat they were loth to leave those manacles behind, the captain made\r\nthem a sign that he would put them on their feet, and that they could\r\ncarry them away. They nodded assent with the head. Immediately, the\r\ncaptain had the manacles put on both of them at the same time. When our\r\nmen were driving home the cross bolt, the giants began to suspect\r\nsomething, but the captain assuring them, however, they stood still.\r\nWhen they saw later that they were tricked, they raged like bulls,\r\ncalling loudly for Setebos [102] to aid them. With difficulty could we\r\nbind the hands of the other two, whom we sent ashore with nine of our\r\nmen, in order that the giants might guide them to the place where the\r\nwife of one of the two whom we had captured [103] was; for the latter\r\nexpressed his great grief at leaving her by signs so that we understood\r\n[that he meant] her. While they were on their way, one of the giants\r\nfreed his hands, and took to his heels with such swiftness that our men\r\nlost sight of him. He went to the place where his associates were, but\r\nhe did not find [there] one of his companions, who had remained behind\r\nwith the women, and who had gone hunting. He immediately went in search\r\nof the latter, and told him all that had happened. [104] The other\r\ngiant endeavored so hard to free himself from his bonds, that our men\r\nstruck him, wounding him slightly on the head, whereat he raging led\r\nthem to where the women were. Gioan Cavagio, the pilot and commander of\r\nthose men, refused to bring back the woman [105] that night, but\r\ndetermined to sleep there, for night was approaching. The other two\r\ngiants came, and seeing their companion wounded, hesitated, [106] but\r\nsaid nothing then. But with the dawn, they spoke [107] to the women,\r\n[whereupon] they immediately ran away (and the smaller ones ran faster\r\nthan the taller), leaving all their possessions behind them. Two of\r\nthem turned aside to shoot their arrows at our men. The other was\r\nleading away those small animals of theirs in order to hunt. [108] Thus\r\nfighting, one of them pierced the thigh of one of our men with an\r\narrow, and the latter died immediately. When the giants saw that, they\r\nran away quickly. Our men had muskets and crossbows, but they could\r\nnever hit any of the giants, [for] when the latter fought, they never\r\nstood still, but leaped hither and thither. Our men buried their dead\r\ncompanion, and burned all the possessions left behind by the giants. Of\r\na truth those giants run swifter than horses and are exceedingly\r\njealous of their wives.\r\n\r\nWhen those people feel sick at the stomach, instead of purging\r\nthemselves, [109] they thrust an arrow down their throat for two palmos\r\nor more [110] and vomit [substance of a] green color mixed with blood,\r\nfor they eat a certain kind of thistle. When they have a headache, they\r\ncut themselves across the forehead; and they do the same on the arms or\r\non the legs and in any part of the body, letting a quantity of blood.\r\nOne of those whom we had captured, and whom we kept in our ship, said\r\nthat the blood refused to stay there [i.e., in the place of the pain],\r\nand consequently causes them suffering. They wear their hair cut with\r\nthe tonsure, like friars, but it is left longer; [111] and they have a\r\ncotton cord wrapped about the head, to which they fasten their arrows\r\nwhen they go hunting. They bind their privies close to their bodies\r\nbecause of the exceeding great cold. [112] When one of those people\r\ndie, x or twelve demons all painted appear to them and dance very\r\njoyfully about the corpse. They notice that one of those demons is much\r\ntaller than the others, and he cries out and rejoices more. [113] They\r\npaint themselves exactly in the same manner as the demon appears to\r\nthem painted. They call the larger demon Setebos, [114] and the others\r\nCheleulle. That giant also told us by signs that he had seen the demons\r\nwith two horns on their heads, and long hair which hung to the feet\r\nbelching forth fire from mouth and buttocks. The captain-general called\r\nthose people Patagoni. [115] They all clothe themselves in the skins of\r\nthat animal above mentioned; and they have no houses except those made\r\nfrom the skin of the same animal, and they wander hither and thither\r\nwith those houses just as the Cingani [116] do. They live on raw flesh\r\nand on a sweet root which they call chapae. [117] Each of the two whom\r\nwe captured ate a basketful of biscuit, and drank one-half pailful of\r\nwater at a gulp. They also ate rats without skinning them.\r\n\r\nIn that port which we called the port of Santo Julianno, we remained\r\nabout five months. [118] Many things happened there. In order that your\r\nmost illustrious Lordship may know some of them, it happened that as\r\nsoon as we had entered the port, the captains of the other four ships\r\nplotted treason in order that they might kill the captain-general.\r\nThose conspirators consisted of the overseer of the fleet, one Johan de\r\nCartagena, the treasurer, Alouise de Mendosa, the accountant, Anthonio\r\nCocha, and Gaspar de Cazada. The overseer of the men having been\r\nquartered, the treasurer was killed by dagger blows, for the treason\r\nwas discovered. Some days after that, Gaspar de Casada, was banished\r\nwith a priest in that land of Patagonia. The captain-general did not\r\nwish to have him killed, because the emperor, Don Carlo, had appointed\r\nhim captain. [119] A ship called \xe2\x80\x9cSancto Jacobo\xe2\x80\x9d was wrecked in an\r\nexpedition made to explore the coast. All the men were saved as by a\r\nmiracle, not even getting wet. Two of them came to the ships after\r\nsuffering great hardships, and reported the whole occurrence to us.\r\nConsequently, the captain-general sent some men with bags full of\r\nbiscuits [sufficient to last] for two months. It was necessary for us\r\nto carry them the food, for daily pieces of the ship [that was wrecked]\r\nwere found. The way thither was long, [being] 24 leguas, [120] or one\r\nhundred millas, and the path was very rough and full of thorns. The men\r\nwere 4 days on the road, sleeping at night in the bushes. They found no\r\ndrinking water, but only ice, which caused them the greatest hardship.\r\n[121] There were very many long shellfish which are called missiglioni\r\n[122] in that port [of Santo Julianno]. They have pearls, although\r\nsmall ones in the middle, but could not be eaten. Incense, ostriches,\r\n[123] foxes, sparrows, and rabbits much smaller than ours were also\r\nfound. We erected a cross on the top of the highest summit there, as a\r\nsign in that land that it belonged to the king of Spagnia; and we\r\ncalled that summit Monte de Christo [i.e., Mount of Christ].\r\n\r\nLeaving that place, we found, in 51 degrees less one-third [124]\r\ndegree, toward the Antarctic Pole, a river of fresh water. There the\r\nships almost perished because of the furious winds; but God and the\r\nholy bodies [125] aided them. We stayed about two months in that river\r\nin order to supply the ships with water, wood, and fish, [the latter\r\nbeing] one braccio in length and more, and covered with scales. They\r\nwere very good although small. [126] Before leaving that river, the\r\ncaptain-general and all of us confessed and received communion as true\r\nChristians. [127]\r\n\r\nThen going to fifty-two degrees toward the same pole, [128] we found a\r\nstrait on the day of the [feast of the] [129] eleven thousand virgins\r\n[i.e. October 21], whose head is called Capo de le Undici Millia\r\nVergine [i.e., cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins] because of that\r\nvery great miracle. That strait is one hundred and ten leguas or 440\r\nmillas long, and it is one-half legua broad, more or less. [130] It\r\nleads to another sea called the Pacific Sea, and is surrounded by very\r\nlofty mountains laden with snow. There it was impossible to find bottom\r\n[for anchoring], but [it was necessary to fasten] the moorings [131] on\r\nland 25 or 30 brazas away. Had it not been for the captain-general, we\r\nwould not have found that strait, for we all thought and said that it\r\nwas closed on all sides. But the captain-general who knew where to sail\r\nto find a well-hidden strait, which he saw depicted on a map in the\r\ntreasury of the king of Portugal, which was made by that excellent man,\r\nMartin de Boemia, sent two ships, the \xe2\x80\x9cSanto Anthonio\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConceptione\xe2\x80\x9d (for thus they were called), to discover what was\r\ninside the cape de la Baia [i.e., of the Bay]. [132] We, with the other\r\ntwo ships, [namely], the flagship, called \xe2\x80\x9cTrinitade,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nother the \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria,\xe2\x80\x9d stayed inside the bay to await them. [133] A\r\ngreat storm struck us that night, which lasted until the middle of next\r\nday, which necessitated our lifting anchor, and letting ourselves drift\r\nhither and thither about the bay. The other two ships suffered a\r\nheadwind and could not double a cape [134] formed by the bay almost at\r\nits end, as they were trying to return to join us; so that they thought\r\nthat they would have to run aground. But on approaching the end of the\r\nbay, and thinking that they were lost, they saw a small opening which\r\ndid not [exceed: crossed out in original MS.] appear to be an opening,\r\nbut a sharp turn [cantone]. [135] Like desperate men they hauled into\r\nit, and thus they discovered the strait by chance. Seeing that it was\r\nnot a sharp turn, but a strait with land, they proceeded farther, and\r\nfound a bay. [136] And then farther on they found another strait and\r\nanother bay larger than the first two. [137] Very joyful they\r\nimmediately turned back to inform the captain-general. We thought that\r\nthey had been wrecked, first, by reason of the violent storm, and\r\nsecond, because two days had passed and they had not appeared, and also\r\nbecause of certain [signals with] smoke made by two of their men who\r\nhad been sent ashore to advise us. [138] And so, while in suspense, we\r\nsaw the two ships with sails full and banners flying to the wind,\r\ncoming toward us. When they neared us in this manner, they suddenly\r\ndischarged a number of mortars, and burst into cheers. [139] Then all\r\ntogether thanking God and the Virgin Mary, we went to seek [the strait]\r\nfarther on.\r\n\r\nAfter entering that strait, we found two openings, one to the\r\nsoutheast, and the other to the southwest. [140] The captain-general\r\nsent the ship \xe2\x80\x9cSancto Anthonio\xe2\x80\x9d together with the \xe2\x80\x9cConcitione\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto ascertain whether that opening which was toward the southeast had an\r\nexit into the Pacific Sea. The ship \xe2\x80\x9cSancto Anthonio\xe2\x80\x9d would not\r\nawait the \xe2\x80\x9cConceptione,\xe2\x80\x9d because it intended to flee and return to\r\nSpagnia\xe2\x80\x94which it did. The pilot of that ship was one Stefan Gomes,\r\n[141] and he hated the captain-general exceedingly, because before that\r\nfleet was fitted out, the emperor had ordered that he be given some\r\ncaravels with which to discover lands, but his Majesty did not give\r\nthem to him because of the coming of the captain-general. On that\r\naccount he conspired with certain Spaniards, and next night they\r\ncaptured the captain of their ship, a cousin [142] of the\r\ncaptain-general, one Alvaro de Meschita, whom they wounded and put in\r\nirons, and in this condition took to Spagnia. The other giant whom we\r\nhad captured was in that ship, but he died when the heat came on. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConceptione,\xe2\x80\x9d as it could not follow that ship, waited for it,\r\nsailing about hither and thither. The \xe2\x80\x9cSancto Anthonio\xe2\x80\x9d turned back\r\nat night and fled along the same [port: crossed out in original MS.]\r\nstrait. [143] We had gone to explore the other opening toward the\r\nsouthwest. Finding, however, the same [port: crossed out in original\r\nMS.] strait continuously, we came upon a river which we called the\r\nriver of Sardine [i.e., Sardines], because there were many sardines\r\nnear it. [144] So we stayed there for four days in order to await the\r\ntwo ships. During that period we sent a well-equipped boat to explore\r\nthe cape of the other sea. The men returned within three days, and\r\nreported that they had seen the cape and the open sea. The\r\ncaptain-general wept for joy, and called that cape, Cape Dezeado [i.e.,\r\nDesire], [145] for we had been desiring it for a long time. We turned\r\nback to look for the two ships, [146] but we found only the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConceptione.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon asking them where the other one was, Johan\r\nSeranno, [147] who was captain and pilot of the former ship (and also\r\nof that ship that had been wrecked) replied that he did not know, and\r\nthat he had never seen it after it had entered the opening. We sought\r\nit in all parts of the strait, as far as that opening whence it had\r\nfled, and the captain-general sent the ship \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria\xe2\x80\x9d back to the\r\nentrance of the strait to ascertain whether the ship was there. Orders\r\nwere given them, if they did not find it, to plant a banner on the\r\nsummit of some small hill with a letter in an earthen pot buried in the\r\nearth near the banner, so that if the banner were seen the letter might\r\nbe found, and the ship might learn the course that we were sailing. For\r\nthis was the arrangement made between us in case that we went astray\r\none from the other. [148] Two banners were planted with their\r\nletters\xe2\x80\x94one on a little eminence in the first bay, and the other in\r\nan islet in the third bay [149] where there were many sea-wolves and\r\nlarge birds. The captain-general waited for the ship with his other\r\nship near he river of Isleo, [150] and he had a cross set up in an\r\nislet near that river, which flowed between high mountains covered with\r\nsnow and emptied into the sea near the river of Sardine. Had we not\r\ndiscovered that strait, the captain-general had determined to go as far\r\nas seventy-five degrees toward the Antarctic Pole. There in that\r\nlatitude, during the summer season, there is no night, or if there is\r\nany night it is but short, and so in the winter with the day. In order\r\nthat your most illustrious Lordship may believe it, when we were in\r\nthat strait, the nights were only three hours long, and it was then the\r\nmonth of October. [151] The land on the left-hand side of that strait\r\nturned toward the southeast [152] and was low. We called that strait\r\nthe strait of Patagonia. One finds the safest of ports every half legua\r\nin it, [153] water, the finest of wood (but not of cedar), fish,\r\nsardines, and missiglioni, while smallage, [154] a sweet herb (although\r\nthere is also some that is bitter) grows around the springs. We ate of\r\nit for many days as we had nothing else. I believe that there is not a\r\nmore beautiful or better strait in the world than that one. [155] In\r\nthat Ocean Sea one sees a very amusing fish hunt. The fish [that hunt]\r\nare of three sorts, and are one braza and more in length, and are\r\ncalled dorado, albicore, and bonito. [156] Those fish follow the flying\r\nfish called colondrini, [157] which are one palmo and more [158] in\r\nlength and very good to eat. When the above three kinds [of fish] find\r\nany of those flying fish, the latter immediately leap from the water\r\nand fly as long as their wings are wet\xe2\x80\x94more than a crossbow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflight. While they are flying, the others run along back of them under\r\nthe water following the shadow of the flying fish. The latter have no\r\nsooner fallen into the water than the others immediately seize and eat\r\nthem. It is in fine a very amusing thing to watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Words of the Patagonian giants\r\n\r\n     For Head                    her\r\n     for Eye                     other\r\n     for Nose                    or\r\n     for Eyebrows                occhechel\r\n     for Eyelids                 sechechiel\r\n     for Nostrils                oresche\r\n     for Mouth                   xiam\r\n     for Lips                    schiahame\r\n     for Teeth                   phor\r\n     for Tongue                  schial\r\n     for Chin                    sechen\r\n     for Hair                    archiz\r\n     for Face                    cogechel\r\n     for Throat                  ohumez\r\n     for Occiput                 schialeschin [159]\r\n     for Shoulders               pelles\r\n     for Elbow                   cotel\r\n     for Hand                    chene\r\n     for Palm of the hand        caimeghin\r\n     for Finger                  cori\r\n     for Ears                    sane\r\n     Armpit                      salischin\r\n     for Teat                    othen\r\n     for Bosom                   ochij\r\n     for Body                    gechel\r\n     for Penis                   sachet\r\n     for Testicles               sacancas\r\n     for Vagina [160]            isse\r\n     for Communication with\r\n       women                     jo hoi\r\n     for Thighs                  chiane\r\n     for Knee                    tepin\r\n     for Rump                    schiaguen\r\n     for Buttocks                hoij\r\n     for Arm                     maz\r\n     for Pulse                   holion\r\n     for Legs                    coss\r\n     for Foot                    thee\r\n     for Heel                    tere\r\n     for Ankle                   perchi\r\n     for Sole of the foot        caotscheni\r\n     for Fingernails             colim\r\n     for Heart                   thol\r\n     for to Scratch              gechare\r\n     for Cross-eyed man          calischen\r\n     for Young man               calemi\r\n     for Water                   holi\r\n     for Fire                    ghialeme\r\n     for Smoke                   giaiche\r\n     for No                      ehen\r\n     for Yes                     rey\r\n     for Gold                    pelpeli\r\n     for Lapis lazuli            secheg\r\n     for Sun                     calexcheni\r\n     for Stars                   settere\r\n     for Sea                     aro\r\n     for Wind                    oni\r\n     for Storm                   ohone\r\n     for Fish                    hoi\r\n     for to Eat                  mechiere\r\n     for Bowl                    elo\r\n     for Pot                     aschanie\r\n     for to Ask                  ghelhe\r\n     Come here                   hai si\r\n     for to Look                 chonne\r\n     for to Walk                 rey\r\n     for to Fight                oamaghce\r\n     for Arrows                  sethe\r\n     for Dog                     holl\r\n     for Wolf                    ani\r\n     for to Go a long distance   schien\r\n     for Guide                   anti\r\n     for Snow                    theu\r\n     for to Cover                hiani\r\n     for Ostrich, a bird         hoihoi\r\n     for its Eggs                jani\r\n     for the powder of the herb\r\n       which they eat            capac\r\n     for to Smell                os\r\n     for Parrot                  cheche\r\n     for Birdcage                cleo\r\n     for Misiglioni              siameni\r\n     for Red Cloth               terechae\r\n     for Cap                     aichel\r\n     for Black                   ainel\r\n     for Red                     taiche\r\n     for Yellow                  peperi\r\n     for to Cook                 yrocoles\r\n     for Belt                    catechin\r\n     for Goose                   cache\r\n     for their big Devil         Setebos\r\n     for their small Devils      Cheleule\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the above words are pronounced in the throat, for such is their\r\nmethod of pronunciation. [161]\r\n\r\nThat giant whom we had in our ship told me those words; for when he,\r\nupon asking me for capac, [162] that is to say, bread, as they call\r\nthat root which they use as bread, and oli, that is to say, water, saw\r\nme write those words quickly, and afterward when I, with pen in hand,\r\nasked him for other words, he understood me. Once I made the sign of\r\nthe cross, and, showing it to him, kissed it. He immediately cried out\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSetebos,\xe2\x80\x9d and made me a sign that if I made the sign of the cross\r\nagain, Setebos would enter into my body and cause it to burst. When\r\nthat giant was sick, he asked for the cross, and embracing it and\r\nkissing it many times, desired to become a Christian before his death.\r\nWe called him Paulo. When those people wish to make a fire, they rub a\r\nsharpened piece of wood against another piece until the fire catches in\r\nthe pith of a certain tree, which is placed between those two sticks.\r\n[163]\r\n\r\nWednesday, November 28, 1520, we debouched from that strait, engulfing\r\nourselves in the Pacific Sea. [164] We were three months and twenty\r\ndays without getting any kind of fresh food. We ate biscuit, which was\r\nno longer biscuit, but powder of biscuits swarming with worms, for they\r\nhad eaten the good. It stank strongly of the urine of rats. [165] We\r\ndrank yellow water that had been putrid for many days. We also ate some\r\nox hides that covered the top of the mainyard to prevent the yard from\r\nchafing the shrouds, and which had become exceedingly hard because of\r\nthe sun, rain, and wind. [166] We left them in the sea for four or five\r\ndays, and then placed them for a few moments on top of the embers, and\r\nso ate them; and often we ate sawdust from boards. Rats were sold for\r\none-half ducado apiece, and even then we could not get them. [167] But\r\nabove all the other misfortunes the following was the worst. The gums\r\nof both the lower and upper teeth of some of our men swelled, so that\r\nthey could not eat under any circumstances and therefore died. [168]\r\nNineteen men died from that sickness, and the giant together with an\r\nIndian from the country of Verzin. Twenty-five or thirty men fell sick\r\n[during that time], in the arms, legs, or in another place, so that but\r\nfew remained well. However, I, by the grace of God, suffered no\r\nsickness. We sailed about four thousand leguas during those three\r\nmonths and twenty days through an open stretch in that Pacific Sea.\r\n[169] In truth it is very pacific, [170] for during that time we did\r\nnot suffer any storm. We saw no land except two desert islets, where we\r\nfound nothing but birds and trees, for which we called them the Ysolle\r\nInfortunate [i.e., the Unfortunate Isles]. They are two hundred leguas\r\napart. We found no anchorage, [but] near them saw many sharks. [171]\r\nThe first islet lies in fifteen degrees of south latitude, and the\r\nother in nine. Daily we made runs of fifty, sixty, or seventy leguas at\r\nthe catena or at the stern. [172] Had not God and His blessed mother\r\ngiven us so good weather we would all have died of hunger in that\r\nexceeding vast sea. Of a verity I believe no such voyage will ever be\r\nmade [again].\r\n\r\nWhen we left that strait, if we had sailed continuously westward we\r\nwould have circumnavigated the world without finding other land than\r\nthe cape of the xi thousand Virgins. [173] The latter is a cape of that\r\nstrait at the Ocean Sea, straight east and west with Cape Deseado of\r\nthe Pacific Sea. Both of those capes lie in a latitude of exactly\r\nfifty-two degrees toward the Antarctic Pole.\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Pole is not so starry as the Arctic. Many small stars\r\nclustered together are seen, which have the appearance of two clouds of\r\nmist. There is but little distance between them, and they are somewhat\r\ndim. In the midst of them are two large and not very luminous stars,\r\nwhich move only slightly. Those two stars are the Antarctic Pole. Our\r\nloadstone, although it moved hither and thither, always pointed toward\r\nits own Arctic Pole, although it did not have so much strength as on\r\nits own side. And on that account when we were in that open expanse,\r\nthe captain-general, asking all the pilots whether they were always\r\nsailing forward in the course which we had laid down on the maps, all\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cBy your course exactly as laid down.\xe2\x80\x9d He answered them\r\nthat they were pointing wrongly\xe2\x80\x94which was a fact\xe2\x80\x94and that it would\r\nbe fitting to adjust the needle of navigation, for it was not receiving\r\nso much force from its side. When we were in the midst of that open\r\nexpanse, we saw a cross with five extremely bright stars straight\r\ntoward the west, those stars being exactly placed with regard to one\r\nanother. [174]\r\n\r\nDuring those days [175] we sailed west northwest, northwest by west,\r\nand northwest, until we reached the equinoctial line at the distance of\r\none hundred and twenty-two degrees from the line of demarcation. The\r\nline of demarcation is thirty degrees from the meridian, and the\r\nmeridian is three degrees eastward from Capo Verde. [176] We passed\r\nwhile on that course, a short distance from two exceedingly rich\r\nislands, one in twenty degrees of the latitude of the Antarctic Pole,\r\nby name Cipangu, and the other in fifteen degrees, by name Sumbdit\r\nPradit. [177] After we had passed the equinoctial line we sailed west\r\nnorthwest, and west by north, and then for two hundred leguas toward\r\nthe west, changing our course to west by south until we reached\r\nthirteen degrees toward the Arctic Pole in order that we might approach\r\nnearer to the land of cape Gaticara. That cape (with the pardon of\r\ncosmographers, for they have not seen it), is not found where it is\r\nimagined to be, but to the north in twelve degrees or thereabouts.\r\n[178]\r\n\r\nAbout seventy [179] leguas on the above course, and lying in twelve\r\ndegrees of latitude and 146 in longitude, we discovered on Wednesday,\r\nMarch 6, a small island to the northwest, and two others toward the\r\nsouthwest, one of which was higher and larger than the other two. The\r\ncaptain-general wished to stop at the large island and get some fresh\r\nfood, but he was unable to do so because the inhabitants of that island\r\nentered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on, so\r\nthat we could not protect ourselves. The men were about to strike the\r\nsails so that we could go ashore, but the natives very deftly stole\r\nfrom us the small boat [180] that was fastened to the poop of the\r\nflagship. Thereupon, the captain-general in wrath went ashore with\r\nforty armed men, who burned some forty or fifty houses together with\r\nmany boats, and killed seven men. [181] He recovered the small boat,\r\nand we departed immediately pursuing the same course. Before we landed,\r\nsome of our sick men begged us if we should kill any man or woman to\r\nbring the entrails to them, as they would recover immediately. [182]\r\n\r\nWhen we wounded any of those people with our crossbow-shafts, which\r\npassed completely through their loins from one side to the other, they,\r\nlooking at it, pulled on the shaft now on this and now on that side,\r\n[183] and then drew it out, with great astonishment, and so died.\r\nOthers who were wounded in the breast did the same, which moved us to\r\ngreat compassion. Those people seeing us departing followed us with\r\nmore than one hundred [184] boats for more than one legua. They\r\napproached the ships showing us fish, feigning that they would give\r\nthem to us; but then threw stones at us and fled. And although the\r\nships were under full sail, they passed between them and the small\r\nboats [fastened astern], very adroitly in those small boats of theirs.\r\nWe saw some women in their boats who were crying out and tearing their\r\nhair, for love, I believe, of those whom we had killed. [185]\r\n\r\nEach one of those people lives according to his own will, for they have\r\nno seignior. [186] They go naked, and some are bearded and have black\r\nhair that reaches to the waist. They wear small palmleaf hats, as do\r\nthe Albanians. They are as tall as we, and well built. They have no\r\nworship. They are tawny, but are born white. Their teeth are red and\r\nblack, for they think that is most beautiful. The women go naked except\r\nthat they wear a narrow strip of bark as thin as paper, which grows\r\nbetween the tree and the bark of the palm, before their privies. They\r\nare goodlooking and delicately formed, and lighter complexioned than\r\nthe men; and wear their hair which is exceedingly black, loose and\r\nhanging quite down to the ground. The women do not work in the fields\r\nbut stay in the house, weaving mats, [187] baskets [casse: literally\r\nboxes], and other things needed in their houses, from palm leaves. They\r\neat cocoanuts, camotes [batate], [188] birds, figs one palmo in length\r\n[i.e., bananas], sugarcane, and flying fish, besides other things. They\r\n[189] anoint the body and the hair with cocoanut and beneseed oil.\r\nTheir houses are all built of wood covered with planks and thatched\r\nwith leaves of the fig-tree [i.e., banana-tree] two brazas long; and\r\nthey have floors and windows. The rooms and the beds are all furnished\r\nwith the most beautiful palmleaf mats. [190] They sleep on palm straw\r\nwhich is very soft and fine. They use no weapons, except a kind of a\r\nspear pointed with a fishbone at the end. Those people are poor, but\r\ningenious and very thievish, on account of which we called those three\r\nislands the islands of Ladroni [i.e., of thieves]. [191] Their\r\namusement, men and women, is to plough the seas with those small boats\r\nof theirs. [192] Those boats resemble fucelere, [193] but are narrower,\r\nand some are black, [some] white, and others red. At the side opposite\r\nthe sail, they have a large piece of wood pointed at the top, with\r\npoles laid across it and resting on the water, in order that the boats\r\nmay sail more safely. The sail is made from palmleaves sewn together\r\nand is shaped like a lateen sail. For rudders they use a certain blade\r\nresembling a hearth shovel which have a piece of wood at the end. They\r\ncan change stern and bow at will [literally: they make the stern, bow,\r\nand the bow, stern], [194] and those boats resemble the dolphins which\r\nleap in the water from wave to wave. Those Ladroni [i.e., robbers]\r\nthought, according to the signs which they made, that there were no\r\nother people in the world but themselves. [195]\r\n\r\nAt dawn on Saturday, March sixteen, [196] 1521, we came upon a high\r\nland at a distance of three hundred leguas from the islands of\r\nLatroni\xe2\x80\x94an island named Zamal [i.e., Samar]. The following day, the\r\ncaptain-general desired to land on another island which was uninhabited\r\nand lay to the right of the abovementioned island, in order to be more\r\nsecure, and to get water and have some rest. He had two tents set up on\r\nthe shore for the sick and had a sow killed for them. On Monday\r\nafternoon, March 18, we saw a boat coming toward us with nine men in\r\nit. Therefore, the captain-general ordered that no one should move or\r\nsay a word without his permission. When those men reached the shore,\r\ntheir chief went immediately to the captain-general, giving signs of\r\njoy because of our arrival. Five of the most ornately adorned of them\r\nremained with us, while the rest went to get some others who were\r\nfishing, and so they all came. The captain-general seeing that they\r\nwere reasonable men, ordered food to be set before them, and gave them\r\nred caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory, bocasine, [197] and other\r\nthings. When they saw the captain\xe2\x80\x99s courtesy, they presented fish, a\r\njar of palm wine, which they call uraca [i.e., arrack], figs more than\r\none palmo long [i.e., bananas], [198] and others which were smaller and\r\nmore delicate, and two cocoanuts. They had nothing else then, but made\r\nus signs with their hands that they would bring umay or rice, [199] and\r\ncocoanuts and many other articles of food within four days.\r\n\r\nCocoanuts are the fruit of the palmtree. [200] Just as we have bread,\r\nwine, oil, and milk, so those people get everything from that tree.\r\nThey get wine in the following manner. They bore a hole into the heart\r\nof the said palm at the top called palmito [i.e., stalk], from which\r\ndistils a liquor [201] which resembles white must. That liquor is sweet\r\nbut somewhat tart, and [is gathered] in canes [of bamboo] as thick as\r\nthe leg and thicker. They fasten the bamboo to the tree at evening for\r\nthe morning, and in the morning for the evening. That palm bears a\r\nfruit, namely, the cocoanut, which is as large as the head or\r\nthereabouts. Its outside husk is green and thicker than two fingers.\r\nCertain filaments are found in that husk, whence is made cord for\r\nbinding together their boats. Under that husk there is a hard shell,\r\nmuch thicker than the shell of the walnut, which they burn and make\r\ntherefrom a powder that is useful to them. [202] Under that shell there\r\nis a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness, which they eat\r\nfresh with meat and fish as we do bread; and it has a taste resembling\r\nthe almond. It could be dried and made into bread. There is a clear,\r\nsweet water in the middle of that marrowy substance which is very\r\nrefreshing. When that water stands for a while after having been\r\ncollected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. When the natives wish\r\nto make oil, they take that cocoanut, and allow the marrowy substance\r\nand the water to putrefy. Then they boil it and it becomes oil like\r\nbutter. When they wish to make vinegar, they allow only the water to\r\nputrefy, and then place it in the sun, and a vinegar results like [that\r\nmade from] white wine. Milk can also be made from it for we made some.\r\nWe scraped that marrowy substance and then mixed the scrapings with its\r\nown water which we strained through a cloth, and so obtained milk like\r\ngoat\xe2\x80\x99s milk. Those palms resemble date-palms, but although not smooth\r\nthey are less knotty than the latter. A family of x persons can be\r\nsupported on two trees, by utilizing them week about for the wine; for\r\nif they did otherwise, the trees would dry up. They last a century.\r\n[203]\r\n\r\nThose people became very familiar with us. They told us many things,\r\ntheir names and those of some of the islands that could be seen from\r\nthat place. Their own island was called Zuluan and it is not very\r\nlarge. [204] We took great pleasure with them, for they were very\r\npleasant and conversable. In order to show them greater honor, the\r\ncaptain-general [205] took them to his ship and showed them all his\r\nmerchandise\xe2\x80\x94cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, gold, and\r\nall the things in the ship. He had some mortars fired for them, whereat\r\nthey exhibited great fear, and tried to jump out of the ship. [206]\r\nThey made signs to us that the abovesaid articles grew in that place\r\nwhere we were going. When they were about to retire they took their\r\nleave very gracefully and neatly, saying that they would return\r\naccording to their promise. The island where we were is called Humunu;\r\nbut inasmuch as we found two springs there of the clearest water, we\r\ncalled it Acquada da li buoni Segnialli [i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cthe Watering-place of\r\ngood Signs\xe2\x80\x9d], for there were the first signs of gold which we found\r\nin those districts. [207] We found a great quantity of white coral\r\nthere, and large trees with fruit a trifle smaller than the almond and\r\nresembling pine seeds. There are also many palms, some of them good and\r\nothers bad. There are many islands in that district, and therefore we\r\ncalled them the archipelago of San Lazaro, as they were discovered on\r\nthe Sabbath of St. Lazurus. [208] They lie in x degrees of latitude\r\ntoward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-one\r\ndegrees from the line of demarcation.\r\n\r\nAt noon on Friday, March 22, those men came as they had promised us in\r\ntwo boats with cocoanuts, sweet oranges, a jar of palm-wine, and a\r\ncock, [209] in order to show us that there were fowls in that district.\r\nThey exhibited great signs of pleasure at seeing us. [210] We purchased\r\nall those articles from them. Their seignior was an old man who was\r\npainted [i.e., tattooed]. He wore two gold earrings [schione] in his\r\nears, [211] and the others many gold armlets on their arms and\r\nkerchiefs about their heads. We stayed there one week, and during that\r\ntime our captain went ashore daily to visit the sick, and [212] every\r\nmorning gave them cocoanut water from his own hand, which comforted\r\nthem greatly. There are people living near that island [213] who have\r\nholes in their ears so large that they can pass their arms through\r\nthem. Those people are caphri, [214] that is to say, heathen. They go\r\nnaked, with a cloth woven from the bark of a tree about their privies,\r\nexcept some of the chiefs who wear cotton cloth embroidered with silk\r\nat the ends by means of a needle. They are dark, fat, and painted. They\r\nanoint themselves with cocoanut and with beneseed oil, as a protection\r\nagainst sun and wind. They have very black hair that falls to the\r\nwaist, and use daggers, knives, and spears [215] ornamented with gold,\r\nlarge shields, fascines, [216] javelins, and fishing nets that resemble\r\nrizali; [217] and their boats are like ours.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of holy Monday, the day of our Lady, March\r\ntwenty-five, while we were on the point of weighing anchor, I went to\r\nthe side of the ship to fish, and putting my feet upon a yard leading\r\ndown into the storeroom, they slipped, for it was rainy, and\r\nconsequently I fell into the sea, so that no one saw me. When I was all\r\nbut under, my left hand happened to catch hold of the clew-garnet of\r\nthe mainsail, which was dangling [ascosa] in the water. I held on\r\ntightly, and began to cry out so lustily that I was rescued by the\r\nsmall boat. I was aided, not, I believe, indeed, through my merits, but\r\nthrough the mercy of that font of charity [i.e., of the Virgin]. That\r\nsame day we shaped our course toward the west southwest between four\r\nsmall islands, namely, Cenalo, Hiunanghan, [218] Ibusson, and Abarien.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning, March twenty-eight, as we had seen a fire on an\r\nisland the night before, we anchored near it. [219] We saw a small boat\r\nwhich the natives call boloto with eight men in it, approaching the\r\nflagship. A slave belonging to the captain-general, who was a native of\r\nZamatra [i.e., Sumatra], which was formerly called Traprobana, spoke to\r\nthem. They immediately understood him, came alongside the ship,\r\nunwilling to enter but taking a position at some little distance. [220]\r\nThe captain seeing that they would not trust us, threw them out a red\r\ncap and other things tied to a bit of wood. They received them very\r\ngladly, and went away quickly to advise their king. About two hours\r\nlater we saw two balanghai coming. They are large boats and are so\r\ncalled [by those people]. They were full of men, and their king was in\r\nthe larger of them, being seated under an awning of mats. When the king\r\ncame near the flagship, the slave spoke to him. The king understood\r\nhim, for in those districts the kings know more languages than the\r\nother people. He ordered some of his men to enter the ships, but he\r\nalways remained in his balanghai, at some little distance from the ship\r\nuntil his own men returned; and as soon as they returned he departed.\r\nThe captain-general showed great honor to the men who entered the ship,\r\nand gave them some presents, for which the king wished before his\r\ndeparture to give the captain a large bar [221] of gold and a basketful\r\nof ginger. The latter, however, thanked the king heartily but would not\r\naccept it. In the afternoon we went in the ships [and anchored] near\r\nthe dwellings of the king.\r\n\r\nNext day, holy Friday, the captain-general sent his slave, who acted as\r\nour interpreter, ashore in a small boat to ask the king if he had any\r\nfood to have it carried to the ships; [222] and to say that they would\r\nbe well satisfied with us, for he [and his men] had come to the island\r\nas friends and not as enemies. The king came with six or eight men\r\n[223] in the same boat and entered the ship. He embraced the\r\ncaptain-general to whom he gave three porcelain jars covered with\r\nleaves and full of raw rice, two very large orade, [224] and other\r\nthings. The captain-general gave the king a garment of red and yellow\r\ncloth made in the Turkish fashion, and a fine red cap; and to the\r\nothers (the king\xe2\x80\x99s men), to some knives and to others mirrors. Then\r\nthe captain-general had a collation spread for them, and had the king\r\ntold through the slave that he desired to be casi casi [225] with him,\r\nthat is to say, brother. The king replied that he also wished to enter\r\nthe same relations with the captain-general. Then the captain showed\r\nhim cloth of various colors, linen, coral [ornaments], and many other\r\narticles of merchandise, and all the artillery, some of which he had\r\ndischarged for him, whereat the natives were greatly frightened. Then\r\nthe captain-general had a man armed as a soldier, [226] and placed him\r\nin the midst of three men armed with swords and daggers, who struck him\r\non all parts of the body. Thereby was the king rendered almost\r\nspeechless. The captain-general told him through the slave that one of\r\nthose armed men was worth one hundred of his own men. The king answered\r\nthat that was a fact. The captain-general said that he had two hundred\r\nmen in each ship who were armed in that manner. [227] He showed the\r\nking cuirasses, swords, and bucklers, and had a review made for him.\r\n[228] Then he led the king to the deck of the ship, that is located\r\nabove at the stern; and had his sea-chart and compass brought. [229] He\r\ntold the king through the interpreter how he had found the strait in\r\norder to voyage thither, and how many moons he had been without seeing\r\nland, whereat the king was astonished. Lastly, he told the king that he\r\nwould like, if it were pleasing to him, to send two of his men with him\r\nso that he might show them some of his things. The king replied that he\r\nwas agreeable, and I went in company with one of the other men. [230]\r\n\r\nWhen I reached shore, the king raised his hands toward the sky and then\r\nturned toward us two. We did the same toward him [231] as did all the\r\nothers. The king took me by the hand; one of his chiefs took my\r\ncompanion; and thus they led us under a bamboo covering, where there\r\nwas a balanghai, [232] as long as eighty of my palm lengths, and\r\nresembling a fusta. We sat down upon the stern of that balanghai,\r\nconstantly conversing with signs. The king\xe2\x80\x99s men stood about us in a\r\ncircle with swords, daggers, spears, and bucklers. [233] The king had a\r\nplate of pork brought in and a large jar filled with wine. At every\r\nmouthful, we drank a cup of wine. The wine that was left [in the cup]\r\nat any time, although that happened but rarely, was put into a jar by\r\nitself. The king\xe2\x80\x99s cup was always kept covered and no one else drank\r\nfrom it but he and I. Before the king took the cup to drink, he raised\r\nhis clasped hands toward the sky, and then toward me; and when he was\r\nabout to drink, he extended the fist of his left hand toward me (at\r\nfirst I thought that he was about to strike me) and then drank. I did\r\nthe same toward the king. They all make those signs one toward another\r\nwhen they drink. We ate with such ceremonies and with other signs of\r\nfriendship. I ate meat on holy Friday, for I could not help myself.\r\nBefore the supper hour I gave the king many things which I had brought.\r\nI wrote down the names of many things in their language. When the king\r\nand the others saw me writing, and when I told them their words, they\r\nwere all astonished. [234] While engaged in that the supper hour was\r\nannounced. Two large porcelain dishes were brought in, one full of rice\r\nand the other of pork with its gravy. We ate with the same signs and\r\nceremonies, after which we went to the palace of the king which was\r\nbuilt like a hayloft and was thatched with fig [i.e., banana] and palm\r\nleaves. It was built up high from the ground on huge posts of wood and\r\nit was necessary to ascend to it by means of ladders. [235] The king\r\nmade us sit down there on a bamboo mat with our feet drawn up like\r\ntailors. After a half-hour a platter of roast fish cut in pieces was\r\nbrought in, and ginger freshly gathered, and wine. The king\xe2\x80\x99s eldest\r\nson, who was the prince, came over to us, whereupon the king told him\r\nto sit down near us, and he accordingly did so. Then two platters were\r\nbrought in (one with fish and its sauce, and the other with rice), so\r\nthat we might eat with the prince. My companion became intoxicated as a\r\nconsequence of so much drinking and eating. They used the gum of a tree\r\ncalled anime wrapped in palm or fig [i.e., banana] leaves for lights.\r\nThe king made us a sign that he was going to go to sleep. He left the\r\nprince with us, and we slept with the latter on a bamboo mat with\r\npillows made of leaves. When day dawned the king came and took me by\r\nthe hand, and in that manner we went to where we had had supper, in\r\norder to partake of refreshments, but the boat came to get us. Before\r\nwe left, the king kissed our hands with great joy, and we his. One of\r\nhis brothers, the king of another island, and three men came with us.\r\nThe captain-general kept him to dine with us, and gave him many things.\r\n[236]\r\n\r\nPieces of gold, of the size of walnuts and eggs are found by sifting\r\nthe earth in the island of that king who came to our ships. All the\r\ndishes of that king are of gold and also some portion of his house, as\r\nwe were told by that king himself. According to their customs he was\r\nvery grandly decked out [molto in ordine], [237] and the finest looking\r\nman that we saw among those people. His hair was exceedingly black, and\r\nhung to his shoulders. He had a covering of silk oh his head, and wore\r\ntwo large golden earrings fastened in his ears. He wore a cotton cloth\r\nall embroidered with silk, which covered him from the waist to the\r\nknees. At his side hung a dagger, the haft of which was somewhat long\r\nand all of gold, and its scabbard of carved wood. He had three spots of\r\ngold on every tooth, and his teeth appeared as if bound with gold.\r\n[238] He was perfumed with storax and benzoin. He was tawny and painted\r\n[i.e., tattooed] all over. That island of his was called Butuan and\r\nCalagan. [239] When those kings wished to see one another, they both\r\nwent to hunt in that island where we were. The name of the first king\r\nis Raia Colambu, and the second Raia Siaui. [240]\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of Sunday, the last of March, and Easter-day, the\r\ncaptain-general sent the priest with some men to prepare the place\r\nwhere mass was to be said; [241] together with the interpreter to tell\r\nthe king that we were not going to land in order to dine with him, but\r\nto say mass. Therefore the king sent us two swine that he had had\r\nkilled. When the hour for mass arrived, we landed with about fifty men,\r\nwithout our body armor, but carrying our other arms, and dressed in our\r\nbest clothes. [242] Before we reached the shore with our boats, six\r\npieces were discharged as a sign of peace. We landed; the two kings\r\nembraced the captain-general, and placed him between them. We went in\r\nmarching order to the place consecrated, which was not far from the\r\nshore. Before the commencement of mass, the captain sprinkled the\r\nentire bodies of the two kings with musk water.\xe2\x80\x9d [243] The mass was\r\noffered up. The kings went forward to kiss the cross as we did, but\r\nthey did not offer the sacrifice. [244] When the body of our Lord was\r\nelevated, they remained on their knees and worshiped Him with clasped\r\nhands. The ships fired all their artillery at once when the body of\r\nChrist was elevated, the signal having been given from the shore with\r\nmuskets. After the conclusion of mass, some of our men took communion.\r\n[245] The captain-general arranged a fencing tournament, [246] at which\r\nthe kings were greatly pleased. Then he had a cross carried in and the\r\nnails and a crown, to which immediate reverence was made. [247] He told\r\nthe kings through the interpreter that they were the standards given to\r\nhim by the emperor his sovereign, so that wherever he might go he might\r\nset up those his tokens. [He said] that he wished to set it up in that\r\nplace for their benefit, for whenever any of our ships came, [248] they\r\nwould know that we had been there by that cross, and would do nothing\r\nto displease them or harm their property [property: doublet in original\r\nMS.]. If any of their men were captured, they would be set free\r\nimmediately on that sign being shown. It was necessary to set that\r\ncross on the summit of the highest mountain, so that on seeing it every\r\nmorning, they might adore it; and if they did that, neither thunder,\r\nlightning, nor storms would harm them in the least. They thanked him\r\nheartily and [said] that they would do everything willingly. The\r\ncaptain-general also had them asked whether they were Moros or heathen,\r\nor what was their belief. They replied that they worshiped nothing, but\r\nthat they raised their clasped hands and their face to the sky; and\r\nthat they called their god \xe2\x80\x9cAbba.\xe2\x80\x9d [249] Thereat the captain was\r\nvery glad, and seeing that, the first king raised his hands to the sky,\r\nand said that he wished that it were possible for him to make the\r\ncaptain see his love for him. The interpreter asked the king why there\r\nwas so little to eat there. The latter replied that he did not live in\r\nthat place except when he went hunting and to see his brother, but that\r\nhe lived in another island where all his family were. The\r\ncaptain-general had him asked to declare whether he had any enemies, so\r\nthat he might go with his ships to destroy them and to render them\r\nobedient to him. [250] The king thanked him and said that he did indeed\r\nhave two islands hostile to him, but that it was not then the season to\r\ngo there. The captain told him that if God would again allow him to\r\nreturn to those districts, he would bring so many men that he would\r\nmake the king\xe2\x80\x99s enemies subject to him by force. He said that he was\r\nabout to go to dinner, and that he would return afterward to have the\r\ncross set up on the summit of the mountain. They replied that they were\r\nsatisfied, and then forming in battalion and firing the muskets, and\r\nthe captain having embraced the two kings, we took our leave.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we all returned clad in our doublets, and that afternoon\r\n[251] went together with the two kings to the summit of the highest\r\nmountain there. When we reached the summit, the captain-general told\r\nthem that he esteemed highly having sweated for them, for since the\r\ncross was there, it could not but be of great use to them. On asking\r\nthem which port was the best to get food, they replied that there were\r\nthree, namely, Ceylon, Zubu, and Calaghann, but that Zubu was the\r\nlargest and the one with most trade. They offered of their own accord\r\nto give us pilots to show us the way. The captain-general thanked them,\r\nand determined to go there, for so did his unhappy fate will. After the\r\ncross was erected in position, each of us repeated a Pater Noster and\r\nan Ave Maria, and adored the cross; and the kings did the same. Then we\r\ndescended through their cultivated fields, and went to the place where\r\nthe balanghai was. [252] The kings had some cocoanuts brought in so\r\nthat we might refresh ourselves. The captain asked the kings for the\r\npilots for he intended to depart the following morning, and [said] that\r\nhe would treat them as if they were the kings themselves, and would\r\nleave one of us as hostage. The kings replied that every hour he wished\r\nthe pilots were at his command, but that night the first king changed\r\nhis mind, and in the morning when we were about to depart, sent word to\r\nthe captain-general, asking him for love of him to wait two days until\r\nhe should have his rice harvested, and other trifles attended to. He\r\nasked the captain-general to send him some men to help him, so that it\r\nmight be done sooner; and said that he intended to act as our pilot\r\nhimself. The captain sent him some men, but the kings ate and drank so\r\nmuch that they slept all the day. Some said to excuse them that they\r\nwere slightly sick. Our men did nothing on that day, but they worked\r\nthe next two days. [253]\r\n\r\nOne of those people brought us about a porringer full of rice and also\r\neight or ten figs [i.e., bananas] fastened together to barter them for\r\na knife which at the most was worth three catrini. [254] The captain\r\nseeing that that native cared for nothing but a knife, called him to\r\nlook at other things. He put his hand in his purse and wished to give\r\nhim one real for those things, but the native refused it. The captain\r\nshowed him a ducado but he would not accept that either. Finally the\r\ncaptain tried to give him a doppione [255] worth two ducados, but he\r\nwould take nothing but a knife; and accordingly the captain had one\r\ngiven to him. When one of our men went ashore for water, one of those\r\npeople wanted to give him a pointed crown of massy gold, of the size of\r\na colona [256] for six strings of glass beads, but the captain refused\r\nto let him barter, so that the natives should learn at the very\r\nbeginning that we prized our merchandise more than their gold. [257]\r\n\r\nThose people are heathens, [258] and go naked and painted. They wear a\r\npiece of cloth woven from a tree about their privies. [259] They are\r\nvery heavy drinkers. [260] Their women are clad in tree cloth from\r\ntheir waist down, and their hair is black and reaches to the ground.\r\nThey have holes pierced in their ears which are filled with gold. Those\r\npeople are constantly chewing a fruit which they call areca, and which\r\nresembles a pear. They cut that fruit into four parts, and then wrap it\r\nin the leaves of their tree which they call betre [i.e., betel]. Those\r\nleaves resemble the leaves of the mulberry. They mix it with a little\r\nlime, and when they have chewed it thoroughly, they spit it out. [261]\r\nIt makes the mouth exceedingly red. All the people in those parts of\r\nthe world use it, for it is very cooling to the heart, and if they\r\nceased to use it they would die. There are dogs, cats, swine, fowls,\r\ngoats, rice, ginger, cocoanuts, figs [i.e., bananas], oranges, lemons,\r\nmillet, panicum, sorgo, [262] wax, and a quantity of gold in that\r\nisland. It lies in a latitude of nine and two-thirds degrees toward the\r\nArctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-two degrees\r\nfrom the line of demarcation. It is twenty-five from the Acquada, and\r\nis called Mazaua. [263]\r\n\r\nWe remained there seven days, after which we laid our course toward the\r\nnorthwest, passing among [264] five islands, namely, Ceylon, Bohol,\r\nCanighan, Baybai, and Gatighan. [265] In the last-named island of\r\nGatigan, there are bats as large as eagles. As it was late we killed\r\none of them, [266] which resembled chicken in taste. There are doves,\r\nturtledoves, [267] parrots, and certain black birds as large as\r\ndomestic chickens, which have a long tail. The last mentioned birds lay\r\neggs as large as the goose, and bury them under the sand, through the\r\ngreat heat of which they hatch out. When the chicks are born, they push\r\nup the sand, and come out. Those eggs are good to eat. There is a\r\ndistance of twenty leguas from Mazaua to Gatighan. We set out westward\r\nfrom Gatighan, but the king of Mazaua could not follow us [closely],\r\nand consequently, we awaited him near three islands, namely, Polo,\r\nTicobon, and Pozon. [268] When he caught up with us he was greatly\r\nastonished at the rapidity with which we sailed. The captain-general\r\nhad him come into his ship with several of his chiefs at which they\r\nwere pleased. Thus did we go to Zubu from Gatighan, the distance to\r\nZubu being fifteen leguas. [269]\r\n\r\nAt noon on Sunday, April seven, we entered the port of Zubu, passing by\r\nmany villages, where we saw many houses built upon logs. On approaching\r\nthe city, the captain-general ordered the ships to fling their banners.\r\nThe sails were lowered and arranged as if for battle, and all the\r\nartillery was fired, an action which caused great fear to those people.\r\nThe captain sent a foster-son of his as ambassador to the king of Zubo\r\nwith the interpreter. When they reached the city, they found a vast\r\ncrowd of people together with the king, all of whom had been frightened\r\nby the mortars. The interpreter told them [270] that that was our\r\ncustom when entering into such places, as a sign of peace and\r\nfriendship, and that we had discharged all our mortars to honor the\r\nking of the village. The king and all of his men were reassured, and\r\nthe king had us asked by his governor what we wanted. The interpreter\r\nreplied that his master was a captain of the greatest king and prince\r\nin the world, and that he was going to discover Malucho; [271] but that\r\nhe had come solely to visit the king because of the good report which\r\nhe had heard of him from the king of Mazaua, and to buy food with his\r\nmerchandise. The king told him that he was welcome [literally: he had\r\ncome at a good time], but that it was their custom for all ships that\r\nentered their ports to pay tribute, and that it was but four days since\r\na junk from Ciama [i.e., Siam] laden with gold and slaves had paid him\r\ntribute. As proof of his statement the king pointed out to the\r\ninterpreter a merchant from Ciama, who had remained to trade the gold\r\nand slaves. The interpreter told the king that, since his master was\r\nthe captain of so great a king, he did not pay tribute to any seignior\r\nin the world, and that if the king wished peace he would have peace,\r\nbut if war instead, war. Thereupon, the Moro merchant said to the king\r\nCata raia chita that is to say, [272] \xe2\x80\x9cLook well, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nmen are the same who have conquered Calicut, Malaca, and all India\r\nMagiore [i.e., India Major]. [273] If they are treated well, they will\r\ngive good treatment, but if they are treated evil, evil and worse\r\ntreatment, as they have done to Calicut and Malaca.\xe2\x80\x9d The interpreter\r\nunderstood it all and told the king that his master\xe2\x80\x99s king was more\r\npowerful in men and ships than the king of Portogalo, that he was the\r\nking of Spagnia and emperor of all the Christians, and that if the king\r\ndid not care to be his friend [274] he would next time send so many men\r\nthat they would destroy him. The Moro related everything to the king,\r\n[275] who said thereupon that he would deliberate with his men, and\r\nwould answer the captain on the following day. Then he had refreshments\r\nof many dishes, all made from meat and contained in porcelain platters,\r\nbesides many jars of wine brought in. After our men had refreshed\r\nthemselves, they returned and told us everything. The king of Mazaua,\r\n[276] who was the most influential after that king and the seignior of\r\na number of islands, went ashore to speak to the king of the great\r\ncourtesy of our captain-general.\r\n\r\nMonday morning, our notary, together with the interpreter, went to\r\nZubu. The king, accompanied by his chiefs, came to the open square\r\nwhere he had our men sit down near him. He asked the notary whether\r\nthere were more than one captain in that company, and whether that\r\ncaptain wished him to pay tribute to the emperor his master. The notary\r\nreplied in the negative, but that the captain wished only to trade with\r\nhim and with no others. The king said that he was satisfied, and that\r\nif the captain wished to become his friend, he should send him a drop\r\nof blood from his right arm, and he himself would do the same [to him]\r\nas a sign of the most sincere friendship. [277] The notary answered\r\nthat the captain would do it. Thereupon, the king told him that all the\r\ncaptains who came to that place, were wont to give presents one to the\r\nother [i.e., mutual presents between the king and the captain], and\r\nasked whether our captain or he ought to commence. [278] The\r\ninterpreter told the king that since he desired to maintain the custom,\r\nhe should commence, and so he did. [279]\r\n\r\nTuesday morning the king of Mazaua came to the ships with the Moro. He\r\nsaluted the captain-general in behalf of the king [of Zubu], and said\r\nthat the king of Zubu was collecting as much food as possible to give\r\nto him, and that after dinner he would send one of his nephews and two\r\nothers of his chief men to make peace. The captain-general had one of\r\nhis men armed with his own arms, and had the Moro told that we all\r\nfought in that manner. The Moro was greatly frightened, but the captain\r\ntold him not to be frightened for our arms were soft toward our friends\r\nand harsh toward our enemies; and as handkerchiefs wipe off the sweat\r\nso did our arms overthrow and destroy all our adversaries, and those\r\nwho hate our faith. [280] The captain did that so that the Moro who\r\nseemed more intelligent than the others, might tell it to the king.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the king\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, who was the prince, came to the ships\r\nwith the king of Mazaua, the Moro, the governor, the chief constable,\r\nand eight chiefs, to make peace with us. The captain-general was seated\r\nin a red velvet chair, the principal men [281] on leather chairs, and\r\nthe others on mats upon the floor. The captain-general asked them\r\nthrough the interpreter whether it were their custom to speak in secret\r\nor in public, and whether that prince and the king of Mazaua had\r\nauthority to make peace. [282] They answered that they spoke in public,\r\nand that they were empowered to make peace. The captain-general said\r\nmany things concerning peace, and that he prayed God to confirm it in\r\nheaven. They said that they had never heard any one speak such words,\r\nbut that they took great pleasure in hearing them. The captain seeing\r\nthat they listened and answered willingly, began to advance arguments\r\nto induce them to accept the faith. Asking them who would succeed to\r\nthe seigniory after the death of the king, he was answered that the\r\nking had no sons but only daughters, the eldest of whom was the wife of\r\nthat nephew of his, who therefore was the prince. [They said that] when\r\nthe fathers and mothers grew old, they received no further honor, but\r\ntheir children commanded them. The captain told them that God made the\r\nsky, the earth, the sea, and everything else, and that He had commanded\r\nus to honor our fathers and mothers, and that whoever did otherwise was\r\ncondemned to eternal fire; that we are all descended from Adam and Eva,\r\nour first parents; that we have an immortal spirit; [283] and many\r\nother things pertaining to the faith. All joyfully entreated the\r\ncaptain to leave them two men, or at least one, [284] to instruct them\r\nin the faith, and [said] that they would show them great honor. The\r\ncaptain replied to them that he could not leave them any men then, but\r\nthat if they wished to become Christians, our priest would baptize\r\nthem, and that he would next time bring priests and friars who would\r\ninstruct them in our faith. They answered that they would first speak\r\nto their king, and that then they would become Christians, [whereat] we\r\nall wept with great joy. The captain-general told them that they should\r\nnot become Christians for fear or to please us, but of their own free\r\nwills; [285] and that he would not cause any displeasure to those who\r\nwished to live according to their own law, but that the Christians\r\nwould be better regarded and treated than the others. All cried out\r\nwith one voice that they were not becoming Christians through fear or\r\nto please us, but of their own free will. Then the captain told them\r\nthat if they became Christians, he would leave a suit of armor, [286]\r\nfor so had his king commanded him; that we could not have intercourse\r\nwith their women without committing a very great, sin, since they were\r\npagans; and that he assured them that if they became Christians, the\r\ndevil would no longer appear to them except in the last moment at their\r\ndeath. [287] They said that they could not answer the beautiful words\r\nof the captain, but that they placed themselves in his hands, and that\r\nhe should treat them as his most faithful servants. The captain\r\nembraced them weeping, and clasping one of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s hands and one\r\nof the king\xe2\x80\x99s between his own, said to them that, by his faith in God\r\nand to his sovereign, the emperor, and by the habit which he wore,\r\n[288] he promised them that he would give them perpetual peace with the\r\nking of Spagnia. They answered that they promised the same. After the\r\nconclusion of the peace, the captain had refreshments served to them.\r\nThen the prince and the king [of Mazaua] presented some baskets of\r\nrice, swine, goats, and fowls to the captain-general on behalf of their\r\nking, and asked him to pardon them, for such things were but little [to\r\ngive] to one such as he. The captain gave the prince a white cloth of\r\nthe finest linen, a red cap, some strings of glass beads, and a gilded\r\nglass drinking cup. Those glasses are greatly appreciated in those\r\ndistricts. He did not give any present to the king of Mazaua, for he\r\nhad already given him a robe of Cambaya, besides other articles. [289]\r\nTo the others he gave now one thing and now another. Then he sent to\r\nthe king of Zubu through me and one other a yellow and violet silk\r\nrobe, made in Turkish style, a fine red cap, some strings of glass\r\nbeads, all in a silver dish, and two gilt drinking cups in our hands.\r\n[290] When we reached the city we found the king in his palace\r\nsurrounded by many people. He was seated on a palm mat on the ground,\r\nwith only a cotton cloth before his privies, and a scarf embroidered\r\nwith the needle about his head, a necklace of great value hanging from\r\nhis neck, and two large gold earrings fastened in his ears set round\r\nwith precious gems. He was fat and short, and tattooed with fire [291]\r\nin various designs. From another mat on the ground he was eating turtle\r\neggs which were in two porcelain dishes, and he had four jars full of\r\npalm wine in front of him covered with sweet-smelling herbs and\r\narranged with four small reeds in each jar by means of which he drank.\r\n[292] Having duly made reverence to him, the interpreter told the king\r\nthat his master thanked him very warmly for his present, and that he\r\nsent this present not in return for his present but for the intrinsic\r\nlove which he bore him. [293] We dressed him in the robe, placed the\r\ncap on his head, and gave him the other things; then kissing the beads\r\nand putting them upon his head, I presented them to him. He doing the\r\nsame [i.e., kissing them] accepted them. Then the king had us eat some\r\nof those eggs and drink through those slender reeds. The others, his\r\nmen, told him in that place, the words of the captain concerning peace\r\nand his exhortation to them to become Christians. The king wished to\r\nhave us stay to supper with him, but we told him that we could not stay\r\nthen. Having taken our leave of him, the prince took us with him to his\r\nhouse, where four young girls were playing [instruments]\xe2\x80\x94one, on a\r\ndrum like ours, but resting on the ground; the second was striking two\r\nsuspended gongs alternately with a stick wrapped somewhat thickly at\r\nthe end with palm cloth; the third, one large gong in the same manner;\r\nand the last, two small gongs held in her hand, by striking one against\r\nthe other, which gave forth a sweet sound. They played so harmoniously\r\nthat one would believe they possessed good musical sense. Those girls\r\nwere very beautiful and almost as white as our girls and as large. They\r\nwere naked except for tree cloth hanging from the waist and reaching to\r\nthe knees. Some were quite naked and had large holes in their ears with\r\na small round piece of wood in the hole, which keeps the hole round and\r\nlarge. They have long black hair, and wear a short cloth about the\r\nhead, and are always barefoot. The prince had three quite naked girls\r\ndance for us. We took refreshments and then went to the ships. Those\r\ngongs are made of brass [metalo] and are manufactured in the regions\r\nabout the Signio Magno [294] which is called China. They are used in\r\nthose regions as we use bells and are called aghon. [295]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, as one of our men had died during the previous\r\nnight, the interpreter and I [296] went to ask the king where we could\r\nbury him. We found the king surrounded by many men, of whom, after the\r\ndue reverence was made, I asked it. [297] He replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I and my\r\nvassals all belong to your sovereign, how much more ought the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI told the king that we would like to consecrate the place, [298] and\r\nto set up a cross there. He replied that he was quite satisfied, and\r\nthat he wished to adore the cross as did we. The deceased was buried in\r\nthe square with as much pomp as possible, in order to furnish a good\r\nexample. Then we consecrated the place, and in the evening buried\r\nanother man. We carried a quantity of merchandise ashore which we\r\nstored in a house. The king took it under his care as well as four men\r\nwho were left to trade the goods by wholesale. [299] Those people live\r\nin accordance with justice, and have weights and measures. They love\r\npeace, ease, and quiet. They have wooden balances, the bar of which has\r\na cord in the middle by which it is held. At one end is a bit of lead,\r\nand at the other marks like quarter-libras, third-libras, and libras.\r\nWhen they wish to weigh they take the scales which has three wires like\r\nours, and place it above the marks, and so weigh accurately. [300] They\r\nhave very large measures without any bottom. [301] The youth play on\r\npipes made like ours which they call subin. Their houses are\r\nconstructed of wood, and are built of planks and bamboo, raised high\r\nfrom the ground on large logs, and one must enter them by means of\r\nladders. They have rooms like ours; and under the house they keep their\r\nswine, goats, and fowls. Large sea snails [corniolli], beautiful to the\r\nsight, are found there which kill whales. For the whale swallows them\r\nalive, and when they are in the whale\xe2\x80\x99s body, they come out of their\r\nshells and eat the whale\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Those people afterward find them\r\nalive near the dead whale\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Those creatures have black teeth\r\nand skin and a white shell, and the flesh is good to eat. They are\r\ncalled laghan. [302]\r\n\r\nOn Friday we showed those people a shop full of our merchandise, [303]\r\nat which they were very much surprised. For metals, iron, and other\r\nlarge merchandise they gave us gold. For the other smaller articles\r\nthey gave us rice, swine, goats, and other food. Those people gave us x\r\npieces of gold for xiiii libras of iron [304] (one piece being worth\r\nabout one and one-half ducados). The captain-general did not wish to\r\ntake too much gold, for there would have been some sailors who would\r\nhave given all that they owned for a small amount of gold, and would\r\nhave spoiled the trade for ever. [305] On Saturday, as the captain had\r\npromised the king to make him a Christian on Sunday, a platform was\r\nbuilt in the consecrated square, which was adorned with hangings and\r\npalm branches for his baptism. The captain-general sent men to tell the\r\nking not to be afraid of the pieces that would be discharged in the\r\nmorning, for it was our custom to discharge them at our greatest feasts\r\nwithout loading with stones. [306]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, April fourteen, forty men of us went ashore, two of\r\nwhom were completely armed and preceded the royal banner. [307] When we\r\nreached land all the artillery was fired. [308] Those people followed\r\nus hither and thither. The captain and the king embraced. The captain\r\ntold the king that the royal banner was not taken ashore except with\r\nfifty men armed as were those two, and with fifty musketeers; but so\r\ngreat was his love for him that he had thus brought the banner. [309]\r\nThen we all approached the platform joyfully. The captain and the king\r\nsat down in chairs of red and violet velvet, [310] the chiefs on\r\ncushions, and the others on mats. [311] The captain told the king\r\nthrough the interpreter that he thanked God for inspiring him to became\r\na Christian; and that [now] he would more easily conquer his enemies\r\nthan before. The king replied that he wished to become a Christian, but\r\nthat some of his chiefs did not wish to obey, because they said that\r\nthey were as good men as he. Then our captain had all the chiefs of the\r\nking called, and told them that, unless they obeyed the king as their\r\nking, he would have them killed, and would give their possessions to\r\nthe king. They replied that they would obey him. The captain told the\r\nking that he was going to Spagnia, but that he would return again with\r\nso many forces that he would make him the greatest king of those\r\nregions, as he had been the first to express a determination to become\r\na Christian. The king, lifting his hands to the sky, thanked the\r\ncaptain, and requested him to let some of his men remain [with him], so\r\nthat he and his people might be better instructed in the faith. The\r\ncaptain replied that he would leave two men to satisfy him, but that he\r\nwould like to take two of the children of the chiefs with him, so that\r\nthey might learn our language, who afterward on their return would be\r\nable to tell the others the wonders [cose] of Spagnia. A large cross\r\nwas set up in the middle of the square. The captain told them that if\r\nthey wished to become Christians as they had declared on the previous\r\ndays, that they must burn all their idols and set up a cross in their\r\nplace. They were to adore that cross daily with clasped hands, and\r\nevery morning after their [i.e., the Spaniards\xe2\x80\x99] custom, they were to\r\nmake the sign of the cross (which the captain showed them how to make);\r\nand they ought to come hourly, at least in the morning, to that cross,\r\nand adore it kneeling. The intention that they had already declared,\r\nthey were to confirm with good works. The king and all the others\r\nwished to confirm it thoroughly. The captain-general told the king that\r\nhe was clad all in white to demonstrate his sincere love toward them.\r\nThey replied that they could not respond to his sweet words. The\r\ncaptain led the king by the hand to the platform while speaking these\r\ngood words in order to baptize him. He told the king that he would call\r\nhim Don Carlo, after his sovereign the emperor; the prince, Don\r\nFernando, after the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s brother; the king of Mazaua, Johanni; a\r\nchief, Fernando, after our chief, that is to say, the captain; the\r\nMoro, Christoforo; and then the others, now one name, and now another.\r\nFive hundred men were baptized before mass. After the conclusion of\r\nmass, the captain invited the king and some of the other chiefs to\r\ndinner, but they refused, accompanying us, however, to the shore. The\r\nships discharged all the mortars; and embracing, the king and chiefs\r\nand the captain took leave of one another. [312]\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the priest and some of the others went ashore to baptize\r\nthe queen, who came with forty women. We conducted her to the platform,\r\nand she was made to sit down upon a cushion, and the other women near\r\nher, until the priest should be ready. She was shown an image of our\r\nLady, a very beautiful wooden child Jesus, and a cross. Thereupon, she\r\nwas overcome with contrition, and asked for baptism amid her tears.\r\n[313] We named her Johanna, after the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s mother; her daughter,\r\nthe wife of the prince, Catherina; the queen of Mazaua, Lisabeta; and\r\nthe others, each their [distinctive] name. Counting men, women, and\r\nchildren, we baptized eight hundred souls. [314] The queen was young\r\nand beautiful, and was entirely covered with a white and black cloth.\r\nHer mouth and nails were very red, while on her head she wore a large\r\nhat of palm leaves in the manner of a parasol, [315] with a crown about\r\nit of the same leaves, like the tiara of the pope; and she never goes\r\nany place without such a one. [316] She asked us to give her the little\r\nchild Jesus to keep in place of her idols; [317] and then she went\r\naway. In the afternoon, [318] the king and queen, accompanied by\r\nnumerous persons, came to the shore. Thereupon, the captain had many\r\ntrombs of fire and large mortars discharged, by which they were most\r\nhighly delighted. [319] The captain and the king called one another\r\nbrothers. That king\xe2\x80\x99s name was Raia Humabon. Before that week had\r\ngone, all the persons of that island, and some from the other island,\r\nwere baptized. We burned one hamlet which was located in a neighboring\r\nisland, because it refused to obey the king or us. We set up the cross\r\nthere for those people were heathen. Had they been Moros, we would have\r\nerected a column there as a token of greater hardness, for the Moros\r\nare much harder to convert than the heathen.\r\n\r\nThe captain-general went ashore daily during those days to hear mass,\r\nand told the king many things regarding the faith. [320] One day the\r\nqueen came with great pomp to hear mass. Three girls preceded her with\r\nthree of her hats in their hands. [321] She was dressed in black and\r\nwhite with a large silk scarf, crossed with gold stripes thrown over\r\nher head, which covered her shoulders; and she had on her hat. A great\r\nnumber of women accompanied her, who were all naked and barefoot,\r\nexcept that they had a small covering of palm-tree cloth before their\r\nprivies, and a small scarf upon the head, and all with hair flowing\r\nfree. The queen, having made the due reverence to the altar, seated\r\nherself on a silk embroidered cushion. Before the commencement of the\r\nmass, the captain sprayed her and some of her women with musk\r\nrosewater, for they delighted exceedingly in such perfumes. The captain\r\nknowing that the queen was very much pleased with the child Jesus, gave\r\nit to her, telling her to keep it in place of her idols, for it was in\r\nmemory [322] of the son of God. Thanking him heartily she accepted it.\r\n\r\nBefore mass one day, the captain-general had the king come clad in his\r\nsilk robe, and the chief men of the city, [to wit], the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother and prince\xe2\x80\x99s father, whose name was Bendara; another of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s brothers, Cadaio; and certain ones called Simiut, Sibuaia,\r\nSisacai, Maghalibe, and many others whom I shall not name in order not\r\nto be tedious. [323] The captain made them all swear to be obedient to\r\ntheir king, and they kissed the latter\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Then the captain had\r\nthe king declare that he would always be obedient and faithful to the\r\nking of Spagnia, and the king so swore. [324] Thereupon, the captain\r\ndrew his Sword before the image of our Lady, and told the king that\r\nwhen anyone so swore, he should prefer to die rather than to break such\r\nan oath, [325] if he swore by that image, by the life of the emperor\r\nhis sovereign, and by his habit to be ever faithful. After the\r\nconclusion of that the captain gave the king a red velvet chair,\r\ntelling him that wherever he went he should always have it carried\r\nbefore him by one of his nearest relatives; and he showed him how it\r\nought to be carried. The king responded that he would do that willingly\r\nfor love of him, and he told the captain that he was making a jewel to\r\ngive to him, namely, two large earrings of gold to fasten [326] in his\r\nears, two armlets to put on his arms, above the elbows, and two other\r\nrings for the feet above the ankles, besides other precious gems to\r\nadorn [327] the ears. Those are the most beautiful ornaments which the\r\nkings of those districts can wear. They always go barefoot, and wear a\r\ncloth garment that hangs from the waist to the knees.\r\n\r\nOne day the captain-general asked the king and the other people why\r\nthey did not burn their idols as they had promised when they became\r\nChristians; and why they sacrificed so much flesh to them. They replied\r\nthat what they were doing was not for themselves, but for a sick man\r\nwho had not spoken now for four days, so that the idols might give him\r\nhealth. He was the prince\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and the bravest and wisest man\r\nin the island. The captain told them to burn their idols and to believe\r\nin Christ, and that if the sick man were baptized, he would quickly\r\nrecover; and if that did not so happen they could behead him [i.e., the\r\ncaptain] then and there. Thereupon, the king replied that he would do\r\nit, for he truly believed in Christ. We made a procession from the\r\nsquare to the house of the sick man with as much pomp as possible.\r\nThere we found him in such condition that he could neither speak nor\r\nmove. We baptized him and his two wives, and x girls. Then the captain\r\nhad him asked how he felt. He spoke immediately and said that by the\r\ngrace of our Lord he felt very well. That was a most manifest miracle\r\n[that happened] in our times. When the captain heard him speak, he\r\nthanked God fervently. Then he made the sick man drink some almond\r\nmilk, which he had already had made for him. Afterward he sent him a\r\nmattress, a pair of sheets, a coverlet of yellow cloth, and a pillow.\r\nUntil he recovered his health, the captain sent him almond milk,\r\nrosewater, oil of roses, and some sweet preserves. Before five days the\r\nsick man began to walk. He had an idol that certain old women had\r\nconcealed in his house burned in the presence of the king and all the\r\npeople. He had many shrines along the seashore destroyed, [328] in\r\nwhich the consecrated meat was eaten. The people themselves cried out\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCastiglia! Castiglia!\xe2\x80\x9d and destroyed [329] those shrines. They\r\nsaid that if God would lend them life, they would burn all the idols\r\nthat they could find, even if they were in the king\xe2\x80\x99s house. Those\r\nidols are made of wood, and are hollow, and lack the back parts. Their\r\narms are open and their feet turned up under them with the legs open.\r\nThey have a large face with four huge tusks like those of the wild\r\nboar; and are painted all over.\r\n\r\nThere are many villages in that island. Their names, those of their\r\ninhabitants, and of their chiefs are as follows: Cinghapola, and its\r\nchiefs, Cilaton, Ciguibucan, Cimaningha, Cimatichat, and Cicanbul; one,\r\nMandaui, and its chief, Apanoaan; one Lalan, and its chief, Theteu;\r\none, Lalutan, and its chief, Tapan; one Cilumai; and one, Lubucun.\r\n[330] All those villages rendered obedience to us, and gave us food and\r\ntribute. Near that island of Zubu was an island called Matan, which\r\nformed the port where we were anchored. The name of its village was\r\nMatan, and its chiefs were Zula and Cilapulapu. That city which we\r\nburned was in that island and was called Bulaia.\r\n\r\nIn order that your most illustrious Lordship may know the ceremonies\r\nthat those people use in consecrating the swine, they first sound those\r\nlarge gongs. [331] Then three large dishes are brought in; two with\r\nroses and with cakes of rice and millet, baked and wrapped in leaves,\r\nand roast fish; the other with cloth of Cambaia [332] and two standards\r\nmade of palm-tree cloth. One bit of cloth of Cambaia is spread on the\r\nground. Then two very old women come, each of whom has a bamboo trumpet\r\nin her hand. When they have stepped upon the cloth they make obeisance\r\nto the sun. Then they wrap the cloths about themselves. One of them\r\nputs a kerchief with two horns on her forehead, and takes another\r\nkerchief in her hands, and dancing and blowing upon her trumpet, she\r\nthereby calls out to the sun. The other takes one of the standards and\r\ndances and blows on her trumpet. They dance and call out thus for a\r\nlittle space, saying many things between themselves to the sun. She\r\nwith the kerchief takes the other standard, and lets the kerchief drop,\r\nand both blowing on their trumpets for a long time, dance about the\r\nbound hog. She with the horns always speaks covertly to the sun, and\r\nthe other answers her. A cup of wine is presented to her of the horns,\r\nand she dancing and repeating certain words, while the other answers\r\nher, and making pretense four or five times of drinking the wine,\r\nsprinkles it upon the heart of the hog. Then she immediately begins to\r\ndance again. A lance is given to the same woman. She shaking it and\r\nrepeating certain words, while both of them continue to dance, and\r\nmaking motions four or five times of thrusting the lance through the\r\nheart of the hog, with a sudden and quick stroke, thrusts it through\r\nfrom one side to the other. The wound is quickly stopped [333] with\r\ngrass. The one who has killed the hog, taking in her mouth a lighted\r\ntorch, which has been lighted throughout that ceremony, extinguishes\r\nit. [334] The other one dipping the end of her trumpet in the blood of\r\nthe hog, goes around marking with blood with her finger first the\r\nforeheads of their husbands, and then the others; but they never came\r\nto us. Then they divest themselves and go to eat the contents of those\r\ndishes, and they invite only women [to eat with them]. The hair is\r\nremoved from the hog by means of fire. Thus no one but old women\r\nconsecrate the flesh of the hog, and they do not eat it unless it is\r\nkilled in this way. [335]\r\n\r\nThose people go naked, wearing but one piece of palm-tree cloth about\r\n[336] their privies. The males, large and small, have their penis\r\npierced from one side to the other near the head, with a gold or tin\r\nbolt as large as a goose quill. In both ends of the same bolt, some\r\nhave what resembles a spur, with points upon the ends; others are like\r\nthe head of a cart nail. I very often asked many, both old and young,\r\nto see their penis, because I could not credit it. In the middle of the\r\nbolt is a hole, through which they urinate. The bolt and the spurs\r\nalways hold firm. They say that their women wish it so, and that if\r\nthey did otherwise they would not have communication with them. When\r\nthe men wish to have communication with their women, the latter\r\nthemselves take the penis not in the regular way and commence very\r\ngently to introduce it [into their vagina], with the spur on top first,\r\nand then the other part. When it is inside it takes its regular\r\nposition; and thus the penis always stays inside until it gets soft,\r\nfor otherwise they could not pull it out. Those people make use of that\r\ndevice because they are of a weak nature. They have as many wives as\r\nthey wish, but one of them is the principal wife. [337] Whenever any of\r\nour men went ashore, both by day and by night, every one invited him to\r\neat and to drink. Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They\r\ndrink frequently and copiously from the jars [338] through those small\r\nreeds, and one of their meals lasts for five or six hours. The women\r\nloved us very much more than their own men. All of the women from the\r\nage of six years and upward, have their vaginas [natura] gradually\r\nopened because of the men\xe2\x80\x99s penises. [339]\r\n\r\nThey practice the following ceremonies when one of their chiefs dies.\r\nFirst all the chief [340] women of the place go to the house of the\r\ndeceased. The deceased is placed in the middle of the house in a box.\r\nRopes are placed about the box in the manner of a palisade, to which\r\nmany branches of trees are attached. In the middle of each branch hangs\r\na cotton cloth like a curtained canopy. The most principal women sit\r\nunder those hangings, and are all covered with white cotton cloth, each\r\none by a girl who fans her with a palm-leaf fan. The other women sit\r\nabout the room sadly. [341] Then there is one woman who cuts off the\r\nhair of the deceased very slowly with a knife. Another who was the\r\nprincipal wife of the deceased, lies down upon him, and places her\r\nmouth, her hands, and her feet upon those of the deceased. When the\r\nformer is cutting off the hair, the latter weeps; and when the former\r\nfinishes the cutting, the latter sings. There are many porcelain jars\r\ncontaining fire about the room, and myrrh, storax, and bezoin, which\r\nmake a strong odor through the house, are put on the fire. They keep\r\nthe body in the house for five or six days during those ceremonies. I\r\nbelieve that the body is anointed with camphor. Then they bury the body\r\nand the same box which is shut in a log by means of wooden nails and\r\ncovered and enclosed by logs of wood. [342] Every night about midnight\r\nin that city, a jet black bird as large as a crow was wont to come, and\r\nno sooner had it thus reached the houses than it began to screech, so\r\nthat all the dogs began to howl; and that screeching and howling would\r\nlast for four or five hours, [343] but those people would never tell us\r\nthe reason of it.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, April twenty-six, Zula, a chief of the island of Matan,\r\n[344] sent one of his sons to present two goats to the captain-general,\r\nand to say that he would send him all that he had promised, but that he\r\nhad not been able to send it to him because of the other chief\r\nCilapulapu, who refused to obey the king of Spagnia. He requested the\r\ncaptain to send him only one boatload of men on the next night, so that\r\nthey might help him and fight against the other chief. The\r\ncaptain-general decided to go thither with three boatloads. We begged\r\nhim repeatedly not to go, but he, like a good shepherd, refused to\r\nabandon his flock. At midnight, sixty men of us set out armed with\r\ncorselets and helmets, together with the Christian king, the prince,\r\nsome of the chief men, and twenty or thirty balanguais. We reached\r\nMatan three hours before dawn. The captain did not wish to fight then,\r\nbut sent a message to the natives by the Moro to the effect that if\r\nthey would obey the king of Spagnia, recognize the Christian king as\r\ntheir sovereign, and pay us our tribute, he would be their friend; but\r\nthat if they wished otherwise, they should wait to see how our lances\r\nwounded. [345] They replied that if we had lances they had lances of\r\nbamboo and stakes hardened with fire. [They asked us] not to proceed to\r\nattack them at once, but to wait until morning, so that they might have\r\nmore men. They said that in order to induce us to go in search of them;\r\nfor they had dug certain pitholes between the houses in order that we\r\nmight fall into them. When morning came forty-nine of us leaped into\r\nthe water up to our thighs, and walked through water for more than two\r\ncrossbow flights before we could reach the shore. The boats could not\r\napproach nearer because of certain rocks in the water. The other eleven\r\nmen remained behind to guard the boats. When we reached land, those men\r\nhad formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand\r\nfive hundred persons. When they saw us, they charged down upon us with\r\nexceeding loud cries, two divisions on our flanks and the other on our\r\nfront. When the captain saw that, he formed us into two divisions, and\r\nthus did we begin to fight. The musketeers and crossbowmen shot from a\r\ndistance for about a half-hour, but uselessly; for the shots only\r\npassed through the shields which were made of thin wood and the arms\r\n[of the bearers]. The captain cried to them, \xe2\x80\x9cCease firing! cease\r\nfiring!\xe2\x80\x9d but his order was not at all heeded. When the natives saw\r\nthat we were shooting our muskets to no purpose, crying out they\r\ndetermined to stand firm, but they redoubled their shouts. When our\r\nmuskets were discharged, the natives would never stand still, but\r\nleaped hither and thither, covering themselves with their shields. They\r\nshot so many arrows at us and hurled so many bamboo spears (some of\r\nthem tipped with iron) at the captain-general, besides pointed stakes\r\nhardened with fire, stones, and mud, that we could scarcely defend\r\nourselves. Seeing that the captain-general sent some men to burn their\r\nhouses in order to terrify them. When they saw their houses burning,\r\nthey were roused to greater fury. Two of our men were killed near the\r\nhouses, while we burned twenty or thirty houses. So many of them\r\ncharged down upon us that they shot the captain through the right leg\r\nwith a poisoned arrow. On that account, he ordered us to retire slowly,\r\nbut the men took to flight, except six or eight of us who remained with\r\nthe captain. The natives shot only at our legs, for the latter were\r\nbare; and so many were the spears and stones that they hurled at us,\r\nthat we could offer no resistance. The mortars in the boats could not\r\naid us as they were too far away. So we continued to retire for more\r\nthan a good crossbow flight from the shore always fighting up to our\r\nknees in the water. The natives continued to pursue us, and picking up\r\nthe same spear four or six times, hurled it at us again and again.\r\nRecognizing the captain, so many turned upon him that they knocked his\r\nhelmet off his head twice, but he always stood firmly like a good\r\nknight, together with some others. Thus did we fight for more than one\r\nhour, refusing to retire farther. An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into\r\nthe captain\xe2\x80\x99s face, but the latter immediately killed him with his\r\nlance, which he left in the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s body. Then, trying to lay hand\r\non sword, he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded\r\nin the arm with a bamboo spear. When the natives saw that, they all\r\nhurled themselves upon him. One of them wounded him on the left leg\r\nwith a large cutlass, [346] which resembles a scimitar, only being\r\nlarger. That caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately\r\nthey rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their\r\ncutlasses, until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and\r\nour true guide. When they wounded him, he turned back many times to see\r\nwhether we were all in the boats. Thereupon, beholding him dead, we,\r\nwounded, retreated, as best we could, to the boats, which were already\r\npulling off. The Christian king would have aided us, but the captain\r\ncharged him before we landed, not to leave his balanghai, but to stay\r\nto see how we fought. When the king learned that the captain was dead,\r\nhe wept. Had it not been for that unfortunate captain, not a single one\r\nof us would have been saved in the boats, for while he was fighting the\r\nothers retired to the boats. I hope through [the efforts of] your most\r\nillustrious Lordship that the fame of so noble a captain will not\r\nbecome effaced in our times. Among the other virtues which he\r\npossessed, he was more constant than ever any one else in the greatest\r\nof adversity. He endured hunger better than all the others, and more\r\naccurately than any man in the world did he understand sea charts [347]\r\nand navigation. And that this was the truth was seen openly, for no\r\nother had had so much natural talent nor the boldness to learn how to\r\ncircumnavigate the world, as he had almost done. That battle was fought\r\non Saturday, April twenty-seven, 1521. [348] The captain desired to\r\nfight on Saturday, because it was the day especially holy to him. Eight\r\nof our men were killed with him in that battle, [349] and four Indians,\r\nwho had become Christians and who had come afterward to aid us were\r\nkilled by the mortars of the boats. Of the enemy, only fifteen were\r\nkilled, while many of us were wounded.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the Christian king sent a message with our consent to\r\nthe people of Matan, to the effect that if they would give us the\r\ncaptain and the other men who had been killed, we would give them as\r\nmuch merchandise as they wished. They answered that they would not give\r\nup such a man, as we imagined [they would do], and that they would not\r\ngive him for all the riches in the world, but that they intended to\r\nkeep him as a memorial. [350]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the day on which the captain was killed, the four men who\r\nhad remained in the city to trade, had our merchandise carried to the\r\nships. Then we chose two commanders, namely, Duarte Barboza, [351] a\r\nPortuguese and a relative of the captain, and Johan Seranno, a\r\nSpaniard. [352] As our interpreter, Henrich by name, was wounded\r\nslightly, he would not go ashore any more to attend to our necessary\r\naffairs, but always kept his bed. On that account, Duarte Barboza, the\r\ncommander of the flagship, cried out to him and told him, that although\r\nhis master, the captain, was dead, he was not therefore free; on the\r\ncontrary he [i.e., Barboza] would see to it that when we should reach\r\nEspagnia, he should still be the slave of Do\xc3\xb1a Beatrice, the wife of\r\nthe captain-general. [353] And threatening the slave that if he did go\r\nashore, he would be flogged, the latter arose, and, feigning to take no\r\nheed to those words, went ashore to tell the Christian king [354] that\r\nwe were about to leave very soon, but that if he would follow his\r\nadvice, he could gain the ships and all our merchandise. Accordingly\r\nthey arranged a plot, and the slave returned to the ship, where he\r\nshowed that he was more cunning [355] than before.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, the first of May, the Christian king sent word to\r\nthe commanders that the jewels [356] which he had promised to send to\r\nthe king of Spagnia were ready, and that he begged them and their other\r\ncompanions to come to dine with him that morning, when he would give\r\nthem the jewels. Twenty-four men went ashore, among whom was our\r\nastrologer, San Mart\xc3\xadn de Sivilla. I could not go because I was all\r\nswollen up by a wound from a poisoned arrow which I had received in my\r\nface. Jovan Carvaio and the constable [357] returned, and told us that\r\nthey saw the man who had been cured by a miracle take the priest to his\r\nhouse. [358] Consequently, they had left that place, because they\r\nsuspected some evil. Scarcely had they spoken those words when we heard\r\nloud cries and lamentations. We immediately weighed anchor and\r\ndischarging many mortars into the houses, drew in nearer to the shore.\r\nWhile thus discharging [our pieces] we saw Johan Seranno in his shirt\r\nbound and wounded, crying to us not to fire any more, for the natives\r\nwould kill him. [359] We asked him whether all the others and the\r\ninterpreter were dead. He said that they were all dead except the\r\ninterpreter. He begged us earnestly to redeem him with some of the\r\nmerchandise; but Johan Carvaio, his boon companion, [and others] would\r\nnot allow the boat to go ashore so that they might remain masters of\r\nthe ships. [360] But although Johan Serrano weeping asked us not to set\r\nsail so quickly, for they would kill him, and said that he prayed God\r\nto ask his soul of Johan Carvaio, his comrade, in the day of judgment,\r\nwe immediately departed. I do not know whether he is dead or alive.\r\n[361]\r\n\r\nIn that island are found dogs, cats, rice, millet, panicum, sorgo,\r\nginger, figs [i.e., bananas], oranges, lemons, sugarcane, garlic,\r\nhoney, cocoanuts, nangcas, [362] gourds, flesh of many kinds, palm\r\nwine, and gold. [363] It is a large island, and has a good port with\r\ntwo entrances\xe2\x80\x94one to the west and the other to the east northeast.\r\n[364] It lies in x degrees [365] of latitude toward the Arctic Pole,\r\nand in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-four [366] degrees from the\r\nline of demarcation. Its name is Zubu. We heard of Malucho there before\r\nthe death of the captain-general. Those people play a violin with\r\ncopper strings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWords of those heathen people\r\n\r\n\r\n  For Man                      lac\r\n  for Woman                    paranpaon\r\n  for Young

Bohol, we burned the ship \xe2\x80\x9cConceptione,\xe2\x80\x9d for too few men of\r\nus were left [to work it]. [378] We stowed the best of its contents in\r\nthe other two ships, and the laid our course toward the south\r\nsouthwest, coasting along the island called Panilongon, [379] where\r\nblack men like those in Etiopia live. Then we came to a large island\r\n[Mindanao], whose king in order to make peace with us, drew blood from\r\nhis left hand marking his body, face, and the tip of his tongue with it\r\nas a token of the closest friendship, and we did the same. I went\r\nashore alone with the king in order to see that island. We had no\r\nsooner entered a river than many fishermen offered fish to the king.\r\nThen the king removed the cloths which covered his privies, as did some\r\nof his chiefs; and began to row while singing past many dwellings which\r\nwere upon the river. Two hours after nightfall we reached the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. The distance from the beginning of the river where our ships\r\nwere to the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, was two leguas. When we entered the house,\r\nwe came upon many torches of cane and palm leaves, [380] which were of\r\nthe anime, of which mention was made above. Until the supper was\r\nbrought in, the king with two of his chiefs and two of his beautiful\r\nwomen drank the contents of a large jar of palm wine without eating\r\nanything. I, excusing myself as I had supped, would only drink but\r\nonce. In drinking they observed all the same ceremonies that the king\r\nof Mazaua did. Then the supper, which consisted of rice and very salt\r\n[381] fish, and was contained in porcelain dishes, was brought in. They\r\nate their rice as if it were bread, and cook it after the following\r\nmanner. They first put in an earthen jar like our jars, a large leaf\r\nwhich lines all of the jar. Then they add the water and the rice, and\r\nafter covering it allow it to boil until the rice becomes as hard as\r\nbread, when it is taken out in pieces. Rice is cooked in the same way\r\nthroughout those districts. [382] When we had eaten, the king had a\r\nreed mat and another of palm leaves, and a leaf pillow brought in so\r\nthat I might sleep on them. The king and his two women went to sleep in\r\na separate place, while I slept with one of his chiefs. [383] When day\r\ncame and until the dinner was brought in, I walked about that island. I\r\nsaw many articles of gold in those houses [384] but little food. After\r\nthat we dined on rice and fish, and at the conclusion of dinner, I\r\nasked the king by signs whether I could see the queen. He replied that\r\nhe was willing, and we went together to the summit of a lofty hill,\r\nwhere the queen\xe2\x80\x99s house was located. When I entered the house, I made\r\na bow to the queen, and she did the same to me, whereupon I sat down\r\nbeside her. She was making a sleeping mat of palm leaves. In the house\r\nthere was hanging a number of porcelain jars and four metal gongs\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nof which was larger than the second, while the other two were still\r\nsmaller\xe2\x80\x94for playing upon. There were many male and female slaves who\r\nserved her. Those houses are constructed like those already mentioned.\r\nHaving taken our leave, we returned to the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, where the\r\nking had us immediately served with refreshments of sugarcane. The most\r\nabundant product of that island is gold. They showed me certain large\r\nvalleys, [385] making me a sign that the gold there was as abundant as\r\nthe hairs of their heads, but they have no iron with which to dig it,\r\nand they do not dare to go to the trouble [to get it]. [386] That part\r\nof the island belongs to the same land as Butuan and Calaghan, and lies\r\ntoward Bohol, and is bounded by Mazaua. As we shall return to that\r\nisland again, I shall say nothing further [now]. The afternoon having\r\nwaned, I desired to return to the ships. The king and the other chief\r\nmen wished to accompany me, and therefore we went in the same\r\nbalanghai. [387] As we were returning along the river, I saw, on the\r\nsummit of a hill at the right, three men suspended from one tree, the\r\nbranches of which had been cut away. I asked the king what was the\r\nreason for that, and he replied that they were malefactors and robbers.\r\nThose people go naked as do the others above mentioned. The king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname is Raia Calanao. [388] The harbor is an excellent one. Rice,\r\nginger, swine, goats, fowls, and other things are to be found there.\r\nThat port lies in a latitude of eight degrees toward the Arctic Pole,\r\nand in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-seven degrees [389] from\r\nthe line of demarcation. It is fifty leguas from Zubu, and is called\r\nChipit. [390] Two days\xe2\x80\x99 journey thence to the northwest is found a\r\nlarge island called Lozon, [391] where six or eight junks belonging to\r\nthe Lequian people go yearly. [392]\r\n\r\nLeaving there and laying our course west southwest, we cast anchor at\r\nan island not very large and almost uninhabited. The people of that\r\nisland are Moros and were banished from an island called Burne. They go\r\nnaked as do the others. They have blowpipes and small quivers at their\r\nside, full of arrows and a poisonous herb. They have daggers whose\r\nhafts are adorned with gold and precious gems, spears, bucklers, and\r\nsmall cuirasses of buffalo horn. [393] They called us holy beings.\r\nLittle food was to be found in that island, but [there were] immense\r\ntrees. It lies in a latitude of seven and one-half degrees toward the\r\nArctic Pole, and is forty-three leguas [394] from Chippit. Its name is\r\nCaghaian. [395]\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five leguas to the west northwest from the above island we\r\nfound a large island, where rice, ginger, swine, goats, fowls, figs\r\none-half braza long and as thick as the arm [i.e., bananas] (they are\r\nexcellent; and certain others are one palmo and less in length, and are\r\nmuch better than all the others), cocoanuts, camotes [batate],\r\nsugarcane, and roots resembling turnips in taste, are found. Rice is\r\ncooked there under the fire in bamboos or in wood; and it lasts better\r\nthan that cooked in earthen pots. We called that land the land of\r\npromise, because we suffered great hunger before we found it. We were\r\noften on the point of abandoning the ships and going ashore in order\r\nthat we might not die of hunger. [396] The king made peace with us by\r\ngashing himself slightly in the breast with one of our knives, and upon\r\nbleeding, touching the tip of his tongue and his forehead in token of\r\nthe truest peace, and we did the same. That island lies in a latitude\r\nof nine and one-third degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and a longitude\r\nof one hundred and seventy-one and one-third [397] degrees from the\r\nline of demarcation. [It is called] Pulaoan. [398]\r\n\r\nThose people of Polaoan go naked as do the others. Almost all [399] of\r\nthem cultivate their fields. They have blowpipes with thick wooden\r\narrows more than one palmo long, with harpoon points, and others tipped\r\nwith fishbones, and poisoned with an herb; while others are tipped with\r\npoints of bamboo like harpoons and are poisoned. [400] At the end of\r\nthe arrow they attach a little piece of soft wood, instead of feathers.\r\nAt the end of their blowpipes they fasten a bit of iron like a spear\r\nhead; [401] and when they have shot all their arrows they fight with\r\nthat. They place a value on brass rings and chains, bells, knives, and\r\nstill more on copper wire for binding their fishhooks. They have large\r\nand very tame cocks, which they do not eat because of a certain\r\nveneration that they have for them. Sometimes they make them fight with\r\none another, and each one puts up a certain amount on his cock, and the\r\nprize goes to him whose cock is the victor. They have distilled rice\r\nwine which is stronger and better than that made from the palm. [402]\r\n\r\nTen leguas southwest of that island, we came to an island, which, as we\r\ncoasted by, seemed to us to be going upward. After entering the port,\r\nthe holy body [i.e., St. Elmo\xe2\x80\x99s fire] appeared to us through the\r\npitchy darkness. There is a distance of fifty leguas [403] from the\r\nbeginning of that island to the port. On the following day, July nine,\r\nthe king of that island sent a very beautiful prau to us, whose bow and\r\nstern were worked in gold. At the bow flew a white and blue banner\r\nsurmounted with peacock feathers. Some men were playing on musical\r\ninstruments [cinphonie] and drums. Two almadies [404] came with that\r\nprau. Praus resemble fustas, while the almadies are their small fishing\r\nboats. Eight old men, who were chiefs, entered the ships and took seats\r\nin the stern upon a carpet. They presented us with a painted wooden jar\r\nfull of betel and areca (the fruit which they chew continually), and\r\njessamine [405] and orange blossoms, a covering of yellow silk cloth,\r\ntwo cages full of fowls, a couple of goats, three jarsful of distilled\r\nrice wine, and some bundles of sugarcane. They did the same to the\r\nother ship, and embracing us took their leave. The rice wine is as\r\nclear as water, but so strong that it intoxicated many of our men. It\r\nis called arach [i.e., arrack].\r\n\r\nSix days later the king again sent three praus with great pomp, which\r\nencircled the ships with musical instruments [cinphonie] playing and\r\ndrums and brass gongs beating. They saluted us with their peculiar\r\ncloth caps which cover only the top of their heads. We saluted them by\r\nfiring our mortars without [loading with] stones. Then they gave us a\r\npresent of various kinds of food, made only of rice. Some were wrapped\r\nin leaves and were made in somewhat longish pieces, some resembled\r\nsugar-loaves, while others were made in the manner of tarts with eggs\r\nand honey. They told us that their king was willing to let us get water\r\nand wood, and to trade at our pleasure. Upon hearing that seven [406]\r\nof us entered their prau bearing a present to their king, which\r\nconsisted of a green velvet robe made in the Turkish manner, a violet\r\nvelvet chair, five brazas of red cloth, a cap, [407] a gilded drinking\r\nglass, a covered glass vase, three writing-books of paper, and a gilded\r\nwriting-case. To the queen [we took] three brazas of [red: crossed out\r\nin original MS.] yellow cloth, a pair of silvered shoes, and a silvered\r\nneedle-case full of needles. [We took] three brazas of red cloth, a\r\ncap, and a gilded drinking-glass to the governor. To the herald who\r\ncame in the prau we gave a robe of red and green cloth, made in the\r\nTurkish fashion, a cap, and a writing book of paper; and to the other\r\nseven chief men, to one a bit of cloth, and to another a cap, and to\r\nall of them a writing book of paper. Then we immediately departed [for\r\nthe land].\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the city, we remained about two hours in the prau,\r\nuntil the arrival of two elephants with silk trappings, and twelve men\r\neach of whom carried a porcelain jar covered with silk in which to\r\ncarry our presents. Thereupon, we mounted the elephants while those\r\ntwelve men preceded us afoot with the presents in the jars. In this way\r\nwe went to the house of the governor, where we were given a supper of\r\nmany kinds of food. During the night we slept on cotton mattresses,\r\n[408] whose lining was of taffeta, and the sheets of Cambaia. Next day\r\nwe stayed in the house until noon. Then we went to the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace\r\nupon elephants, with our presents in front as on the preceding day. All\r\nthe streets from the governor\xe2\x80\x99s to the king\xe2\x80\x99s house were full of\r\nmen with swords, spears, and shields, for such were the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders. We entered the courtyard of the palace mounted on the\r\nelephants. We went up a ladder accompanied by the governor and other\r\nchiefs, and entered a large hall full of many nobles, [409] where we\r\nsat down upon a carpet with the presents in the jars near us. At the\r\nend of that hall there is another hall higher but somewhat smaller. It\r\nwas all adorned with silk hangings, and two windows, through which\r\nlight entered the hall and hung with two brocade curtains, opened from\r\nit. There were three hundred footsoldiers with naked rapiers at their\r\nthighs in that hall to guard the king. [410] At the end of the small\r\nhall was a large window from which a brocade curtain was drawn aside so\r\nthat we could see within it the king seated at a table with one of his\r\nyoung sons chewing betel. [411] No one but women were behind him. Then\r\na chief told us that we could not speak to the king, and that if we\r\nwished anything, we were to tell it to him, so that he could\r\ncommunicate it to one of higher rank. The latter would communicate it\r\nto a brother of the governor who was stationed in the smaller hall, and\r\nthis man would communicate it by means of a speaking-tube through a\r\nhole in the wall to one who was inside with the king. The chief taught\r\nus the manner of making three obeisances to the king with our hands\r\nclasped above the head, raising first one foot and then the other and\r\nthen kissing the hands toward him, and we did so, that being the method\r\nof the royal obeisance. We told the king that we came from the king of\r\nSpagnia, and that the latter desired to make peace with him and asked\r\nonly for permission to trade. The king had us told that since the king\r\nof Spagnia desired to be his friend, he was very willing to be his, and\r\nsaid that we could take water and wood, and trade at our pleasure. Then\r\nwe gave him the presents, on receiving each of which he nodded\r\nslightly. To each one of us was given some brocaded and gold cloth and\r\nsilk, which were placed upon our left shoulders, where they were left\r\nbut a moment. [412] They presented us with refreshments of cloves and\r\ncinnamon, after which the curtains were drawn to and the windows\r\nclosed. The men in the palace were all attired in cloth of gold and\r\nsilk which covered their privies, and carried daggers with gold hafts\r\nadorned with pearls and precious gems, and they had many rings on their\r\nhands. We returned upon the elephants to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s house, seven\r\nmen carrying the king\xe2\x80\x99s presents to us and always preceding us. When\r\nwe reached the house, they gave each one of us his present, placing\r\nthem upon our left shoulders. We gave each of those men a couple of\r\nknives for his trouble. Nine men came to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s house with a\r\nlike number of large wooden trays from the king. Each tray contained\r\nten or twelve porcelain dishes full of veal, capons, chickens,\r\npeacocks, and other animals, and fish. We supped on the ground upon a\r\npalm mat from thirty or thirty-two different kinds of meat besides the\r\nfish and other things. At each mouthful of food we drank a small cupful\r\nof their distilled wine from a porcelain cup the size of an egg. We ate\r\nrice and other sweet food with gold spoons like ours. In our sleeping\r\nquarters there during those two nights, two torches of white wax were\r\nkept constantly alight in two rather tall silver candlesticks, and two\r\nlarge lamps full of oil with four wicks apiece and two men to snuff\r\nthem continually. We went elephant-back to the seashore, where we found\r\ntwo praus which took us back to the ships. That city [413] is entirely\r\nbuilt in salt water, except the houses of the king and certain chiefs.\r\nIt contains twenty-five thousand fires [i.e., families]. [414] The\r\nhouses are all constructed of wood and built up from the ground on tall\r\npillars. When the tide is high the women go in boats through the\r\nsettlement [tera] selling the articles necessary to maintain life.\r\nThere is a large brick wall in front of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house with towers\r\nlike a fort, in which were mounted fifty-six bronze [metalo] pieces,\r\nand six of iron. During the two days of our stay there, many pieces\r\nwere discharged. That king is a Moro and his name is Raia Siripada. He\r\nwas forty years old and corpulent. No one serves him except women who\r\nare the daughters [415] of chiefs. He never goes outside of his palace,\r\nunless when he goes hunting, and no one is allowed to talk with him\r\nexcept through the speaking tube. He has x scribes, called Xiritoles,\r\n[416] who write down his deeds on very thin tree bark.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, July twenty-nine, we saw more than one hundred praus\r\ndivided into three squadrons and a like number of tunguli  [417] (which\r\nare their small boats) coming toward us. Upon catching sight of them,\r\nimagining that there was some trickery afoot, we hoisted our sails as\r\nquickly as possible, abandoning an anchor in our haste. We expected\r\nespecially that we were to be captured in between certain junks which\r\nhad anchored behind us on the preceding day. We immediately turned upon\r\nthe latter, capturing four of them and killing many persons. Three or\r\nfour of the junks sought flight by beaching. In one of the junks which\r\nwe captured was the son of the king of the island of Lozon. He was the\r\ncaptain-general of the king of Burne, and came with those junks from a\r\nlarge city named Laoe, [418] which is located at the end of that island\r\n[i.e., Borneo] toward Java Major. He had destroyed and sacked that city\r\nbecause it refused to obey the king [of Burne], but the king of Java\r\nMajor instead. Giovan Carvaio, our pilot, allowed that captain and the\r\njunks to go without our consent, for a certain sum of gold, as we\r\nlearned afterward. Had the pilot not given up the captain to the king,\r\nthe latter would have given us whatever we had asked, for that captain\r\nwas exceedingly feared throughout those regions, especially by the\r\nheathens, as the latter are very hostile to that Moro king. In that\r\nsame port there is another city inhabited by heathens, which is larger\r\nthan that of the Moros, and built like the latter in salt water. On\r\nthat account the two peoples have daily combats together in that same\r\nharbor. The heathen king is as powerful as the Moro king, but is not so\r\nhaughty, and could be converted easily to the Christian faith. When the\r\nMoro king heard how we had treated the junks, he sent us a message by\r\none of our men who was ashore to the effect that the praus were not\r\ncoming to do us any harm, but that they were going to attack the\r\nheathens. As a proof of that statement, the Moros showed him some heads\r\nof men who had been killed, which they declared to be the heads of\r\nheathens. We sent a message to the king, asking him to please allow two\r\nof our men who were in the city for purposes of trade and the son of\r\nJohan Carvaio, who had been born in the country of Verzin, to come to\r\nus, but the king refused. That was the consequences of Johan Carvaio\r\nletting the above captain go. We kept sixteen of the chiefest men [of\r\nthe captured junks] to take them to Spagnia, and three women in the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s name, but Johan Carvaio usurped the latter for himself. [419]\r\n\r\nJunks are their ships and are made in the following manner. The bottom\r\npart is built about two palmos above the water and is of planks\r\nfastened with wooden pegs, which are very well made; above that they\r\nare entirely made of very large bamboos. They have a bamboo as a\r\ncounterweight. One of those junks carries as much cargo as a ship.\r\nTheir masts are of bamboo, and the sails of the bark of trees. [420]\r\nTheir porcelain is a sort of exceedingly white earth which is left for\r\nfifty years under the earth before it is worked, for otherwise it would\r\nnot be fine. The father buries it for the son. If [poison] is placed in\r\na dish made of fine porcelain, the dish immediately breaks. [421] The\r\nmoney made by the Moros in those regions is of bronze [metalo] pierced\r\nin the middle in order that it may be strung. On only one side of it\r\nare four characters, which are letters of the great king of Chiina. We\r\ncall that money picis. [422] They gave us six porcelain dishes for one\r\ncathil [423] (which is equivalent to two of our libras) of quicksilver;\r\none hundred picis for one book of writing paper; one small porcelain\r\nvase for one hundred and sixty cathils of bronze [metalo]; one\r\nporcelain vase for three knives; one bahar (which is equivalent to two\r\nhundred and three cathils), of wax for 160 cathils of bronze [metalo];\r\none bahar of salt for eighty cathils of bronze [metalo]; one bahar of\r\nanime to calk the ships (for no pitch is found in those regions) for\r\nforty cathils of bronze [metalo]. [424] Twenty tahils make one cathil.\r\nAt that place the people highly esteem bronze [metalo], quicksilver,\r\nglass, cinnabar, [425] wool cloth, linens, and all our other\r\nmerchandise, although iron and spectacles [426] more than all the rest.\r\nThose Moros go naked as do the other peoples [of those regions]. They\r\ndrink quicksilver\xe2\x80\x94the sick man drinks it to cleanse himself, and the\r\nwell man to preserve his health.\r\n\r\nThe king of Burne has two pearls as large as two hen\xe2\x80\x99s eggs. They are\r\nso round that they will not stand still on a table. I know that for a\r\nfact, for when we carried the king\xe2\x80\x99s presents to him, signs were made\r\nfor him to show them to us, but he said that he would show them next\r\nday. Afterward some chiefs said that they had seen them.\r\n\r\nThose Moros worship Mahomet. The latter\xe2\x80\x99s law orders them not to eat\r\npork; as they wash the buttocks with the left hand, not to use that\r\nhand in eating; [427] not to cut anything with the right hand; to sit\r\ndown to urinate; not to kill fowls or goats without first addressing\r\nthe sun; to cut off the tops of the wings with the little bits of skin\r\nthat stick up from under and the feet of fowls; then to split them in\r\ntwain; to wash the face with the right hand, but not to cleanse the\r\nteeth with the fingers; and not to eat anything that has been killed\r\nunless it be by themselves. [428] They are circumcised like the Jews.\r\n\r\nCamphor, a kind of balsam, is produced in that island. It exudes\r\nbetween the wood and the bark, and the drops are as small as [grains\r\nof] wheat bran. [429] If it is exposed it gradually evaporates\r\n[literally: becomes nothing]. Those people call it capor. Cinnamon,\r\nginger, mirabolans, oranges, lemons, nangcas, watermelons, cucumbers,\r\ngourds, turnips, cabbages, scallions, cows, buffaloes, swine, goats,\r\nchickens, geese, deer, elephants, horses, and other things are found\r\nthere. [430] That island is so large that it takes three months to sail\r\nround it in a prau. It lies in a latitude of five and one-fourth\r\ndegrees toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and\r\nseventy-six and two-thirds degrees from the line of demarcation, and\r\nits name is Burne. [431]\r\n\r\nLeaving that island, we turned back in order to find a suitable place\r\nto calk the ships, for they were leaking. One ship ran on to some\r\nshoals of an island called Bibalon, [432] because of the carelessness\r\nof its pilot, but by the help of God we freed it. A sailor of that ship\r\nincautiously snuffed a candle into a barrel full of gunpowder, but he\r\nquickly snatched it out without any harm. [433] Then pursuing our\r\ncourse, we captured a prau laden with cocoanuts on its way to Burne.\r\nIts crew sought refuge on an islet, until we captured it. [434] Three\r\nother praus escaped behind certain islets.\r\n\r\nAt the head of Burne between it and an island called Cimbonbon, which\r\nlies in [a latitude of] eight degrees and seven minutes, [435] is a\r\nperfect port for repairing ships. Consequently, we entered it; but as\r\nwe lacked many things for repairing the ships, we delayed there for\r\nforty-two days. During that time, each one of us labored hard, one at\r\none thing and one at another. Our greatest fatigue however was to go\r\nbarefoot to the woods for wood. In that island there are wild boars, of\r\nwhich we killed one which was going by water from one island to another\r\n[by pursuing it] with the small boat. Its head was two and one-half\r\npalmos long, [436] and its teeth were large. There are found large\r\ncrocodiles, both on land and sea, oysters and shellfish of various\r\nkinds. Among the last named we found two, the flesh of one of which\r\nweighed twenty-six libras, and the other forty-four. [437] We caught a\r\nfish, which had a head like that of a hog and two horns. Its body\r\nconsisted entirely of one bone, and on its back it resembled a saddle;\r\nand it was small. [438] Trees are also found there which produce leaves\r\nwhich are alive when they fall, and walk. Those leaves are quite like\r\nthose of the mulberry, but are not so long. On both sides near the\r\nstem, which is short and pointed, they have two feet. They have no\r\nblood, but if one touches [439] them they run away. I kept one of them\r\nfor nine days in a box. When I opened the box, that leaf went round and\r\nround it. [440] I believe those leaves live on nothing but air.\r\n\r\nHaving left that island, [441] that is, the port, we met at the head of\r\nthe island of Pulaoan a junk which was coming from Burne, on which was\r\nthe governor of Pulaoan. We made them a signal to haul in their sails,\r\nand as they refused to haul them in, we captured the junk by force, and\r\nsacked it. [We told] the governor [that] if [he] wished his freedom, he\r\nwas to give us, inside of seven days, four hundred measures of rice,\r\ntwenty swine, twenty goats, and one hundred and fifty fowls. After that\r\nhe presented us with cocoanuts, figs [i.e., bananas], sugarcanes, jars\r\nfull of palm wine, and other things. Seeing his liberality, we returned\r\nsome of his daggers and arquebuses to him, giving him in addition, a\r\nflag, a yellow damask robe, and xv brazas of cloth; to his son, a cloak\r\nof blue cloth; to a brother of the governor, a robe of green cloth and\r\nother things; and we parted from them as friends. We turned our course\r\nback between the island of Cagaian and the port of Cippit, and laid our\r\ncourse east by south in order that we might find the islands of\r\nMalucho. We passed by certain reefs [literally: small elevations] near\r\nwhich we found the sea to be full of grass, although the depth was very\r\ngreat. When we passed through them, it seemed as though we were\r\nentering another sea. Leaving Chipit to the east, we found two island,\r\nZolo and Taghima, [442] which lie toward the west, and near which\r\npearls are found. [443] The two pearls of the king of Burne were found\r\nthere, and the king got them, as was told us, in the following manner.\r\nThat king took to wife a daughter of the king of Zolo, who told him\r\nthat her father had those two pearls. The king determined to get\r\npossession of them by hook or by crook. Going one night with five\r\nhundred praus, [444] he captured the king and two of his sons, and took\r\nthem to Burne with him. [He told] the king of Zolo that if he wished\r\nfreedom, he must surrender the two pearls to him.\r\n\r\nThen we laid our course east by north between two settlements called\r\nCauit and Subanin, and an inhabited island called Monoripa, located x\r\nleguas from the reefs. [445] The people of that island make their\r\ndwellings in boats and do not live otherwise. In those two settlements\r\nof Cavit and Subanin, which are located in the island of Butuan and\r\nCalaghan, is found the best cinnamon that grows. Had we stayed there\r\ntwo days, those people would have laden our ships for us, but as we had\r\na wind favorable for passing a point and certain islets which were near\r\nthat island, we did not wish to delay. While under sail we bartered two\r\nlarge knives which we had taken from the governor of Pulaoan for\r\nseventeen libras [of cinnamon]. The cinnamon tree grows to a height of\r\nthree or four cubits, and as thick as the fingers of the hand. It has\r\nbut three or four small branches and its leaves resemble those of the\r\nlaurel. Its bark is the cinnamon, and it is gathered twice per year.\r\nThe wood and leaves are as strong as the cinnamon when they are green.\r\nThose people call it caiu mana. Caiu means wood, and mana, sweet,\r\nhence, \xe2\x80\x9csweet wood.\xe2\x80\x9d [446]\r\n\r\nLaying our course toward the northeast, and going to a large city\r\ncalled Maingdanao, which is located in the island of Butuan and\r\nCalaghan, so that we might gather information concerning Maluco, we\r\ncaptured by force a bigniday, [447] a vessel resembling a prau, and\r\nkilled seven men. It contained only eighteen men, and they were as well\r\nbuilt as any whom we had seen in those regions. [448] All were chiefs\r\nof Maingdanao, among them being one who told us that he was a brother\r\nof the king of Maingdanao, and that he knew the location of Malucho.\r\nThrough his directions we discontinued our course toward the northeast,\r\nand took that toward the southeast. At a cape of that island of Butuan\r\nand Caleghan, and near a river, are found shaggy men who are\r\nexceedingly great fighters and archers. They use swords one palmo in\r\nlength, and eat only raw human hearts with the juice of oranges or\r\nlemons. [449] Those shaggy people are called Benaian. When we took our\r\ncourse toward the southeast, we lay in a latitude of six degrees and\r\nseven minutes toward the Arctic Pole, and thirty [450] leguas from\r\nCavit. [451]\r\n\r\nSailing toward the southeast, we found four islands, [namely], Ciboco,\r\nBiraham Batolach, [452] Sarangani, and Candighar. [453] One Saturday\r\nnight, October twenty-six, while coasting by Birahan Batolach, we\r\nencountered a most furious storm. Thereupon, praying God, we lowered\r\nall the sails. Immediately our three saints appeared to us and\r\ndissipated all the darkness. [454] St. Elmo remained for more than two\r\nhours on the maintop, like a torch; St. Nicholas on the mizzentop; and\r\nSt. Clara on the foretop. We promised a slave to St. Elmo, St.\r\nNicholas, and St. Clara, and gave alms to each one. Then continuing our\r\nvoyage, we entered a harbor between the two islands of Saranghani and\r\nCandighar, and anchored to the eastward near a settlement of Sarangani,\r\nwhere gold and pearls are found. Those people are heathens and go naked\r\nas do the others. That harbor lies in a latitude of five degrees nine\r\nminutes, and is fifty leguas from Cavit.\r\n\r\nRemaining one day in that harbor, we captured two pilots by force, in\r\norder that they might show us where Malucho lay. [455] Then laying our\r\ncourse south southwest, we passed among eight inhabited and desert\r\nislands, which were situated in the manner of a street. Their names are\r\nCheaua, Cauiao, Cabiao, Camanuca, Cabaluzao, Cheai, Lipan, and Nuza.\r\n[456] Finally we came to an island at their end, which was very\r\nbeautiful to look at. As we had a contrary wind, so that we could not\r\ndouble a point of that island, we sailed hither and thither near it.\r\nConsequently, one of the men whom we had captured at Saranghai, and the\r\nbrother of the king of Maingdanao who took with him his small son,\r\nescaped during the night by swimming to that island. But the boy was\r\ndrowned, for he was unable to hold tightly to his father\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\nBeing unable to double the said point, we passed below the island where\r\nthere were many islets. That island has four kings, [namely], Raia\r\nMatandatu, Raia Lalagha, Ra\xc3\xada Bapti, and Raia Parabu. The people are\r\nheathens. The island lies in a latitude of three and one-half degrees\r\ntoward the Arctic Pole and is 27 leguas from Saranghany. Its name is\r\nSanghir. [457]\r\n\r\nContinuing the same course, we passed near six islands, [namely],\r\nCheama, Carachita, Para, Zanghalura, Ciau (which is ten leguas from\r\nSanghir, and has a high but not large mountain, and whose king is\r\ncalled Raia Ponto), and Paghinzara. [458] The latter is located eight\r\nleguas from Ciau, and has three high mountains. The name of its king is\r\nRaia Babintan. [459] [Then we found the island] Talaut; and we found\r\ntwelve leguas to the east of Paghinzara two islands, not very large,\r\nbut inhabited, called Zoar and Meau. [460] After passing those two\r\nislands, on Wednesday, the sixth of November, we discovered four lofty\r\nislands fourteen leguas east of the two [abovementioned islands]. The\r\npilot who still remained with us told us that those four islands were\r\nMaluco. Therefore, we thanked God and as an expression of our joy\r\ndischarged all our artillery. It was no wonder that we were so glad,\r\nfor we had passed twenty-seven months less two days in our search for\r\nMalucho. [461] Among all those islands [among all those islands:\r\ndoublet in original MS.], even to Malucho, the shallowest bottom that\r\nwe found was at a depth of one or two hundred brazas, notwithstanding\r\nthe assertion of the Portuguese that that region could not be navigated\r\nbecause of the numerous shoals and the dark sky as they have imagined.\r\n[462]\r\n\r\nThree hours before sunset on Friday, November eight, 1521, [463] we\r\nentered into a harbor of an island called Tadore, and anchoring near\r\nthe shore in twenty brazas we fired all our artillery. Next day the\r\nking came to the ships in a prau, and circled about them once. We\r\nimmediately went to meet him with the small boat, in order to show him\r\nhonor. He made us enter his prau and seat ourselves near him. He was\r\nseated under a silk awning which sheltered him on all sides. In front\r\nof him was one of his sons with the royal scepter, and two persons with\r\ntwo gold jars to pour water on his hands, and two others with two\r\ngilded caskets filled with their betel. The king told us that we were\r\nwelcome there, and that he had dreamt some time ago that some ships\r\nwere coming to Malucho from remote parts; and that for more assurance\r\nhe had determined to consult the moon, [464] whereupon he had seen the\r\nships were coming, and that we were they. Upon the king entering our\r\nships all kissed his hand and then we led him to the stern. When he\r\nentered inside there, he would not stoop, but entered from above. [465]\r\nCausing him to sit down in a red velvet chair, we clothed him in a\r\nyellow velvet robe made in the Turkish fashion. In order to show him\r\ngreater honor, we sat down on the ground near him. Then when all were\r\nseated, the king began to speak and said that he and all his people\r\ndesired ever to be the most loyal friends and vassals to our king of\r\nSpagnia. He received us as his children, and we could go ashore as if\r\nin our own houses, for from that time thenceforth, his island was to be\r\ncalled no more Tadore but Castiglia, because of the great love which he\r\nbore to our king, his sovereign. We made him a present which consisted\r\nof the robe, the chair, a piece of delicate linen, four brazas of\r\nscarlet cloth, a piece of brocaded silk, a piece of yellow damask, some\r\nIndian cloth embroidered with gold and silk, a piece of berania (the\r\nwhite linen of Cambaia), two caps, six strings of glass beads, twelve\r\nknives, three large mirrors, six pairs of scissors, six combs, some\r\ngilded drinking-cups, [466] and other articles. To his son we gave an\r\nIndian cloth of gold and silk, a large mirror, a cap, and two knives;\r\n[467] and to each of nine others\xe2\x80\x94all of them his chiefs\xe2\x80\x94a silk\r\ncloth, caps, and two knives; and to many others caps or knives. We kept\r\ngiving presents until the king bade us desist. After that he declared\r\nto us that he had nothing else except his own life to send to the king\r\nhis sovereign. We were to approach nearer to the city, and whoever came\r\nto the ships at night, we were to kill with our muskets. In leaving the\r\nstern, the king would never bend his head. [468] When he took his leave\r\nwe discharged all the guns. That king is a Moro and about forty-five\r\nyears old. He is well built and has a royal presence, [469] and is an\r\nexcellent astrologer. At that time he was clad in a shirt of the most\r\ndelicate white stuff with the ends of the sleeves embroidered in gold,\r\nand in a cloth that reached from his waist to the ground. He was\r\nbarefoot, and had a silk scarf wrapped about his head [his head,\r\ndoublet in original MS.], and above it a garland of flowers. His name\r\nis Raia Sultan Manzor. [470]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, November x, that king desired us to tell him how long it was\r\nsince we had left Spagnia, and what pay and quintalada [471] the king\r\ngave to each of us. He requested us to give him a signature of the king\r\nand a royal banner, for then and thenceforth, he would cause it that\r\nhis island and another called Tarenate (provided that he were able to\r\ncrown one of his [sons: crossed out in original MS.] grandsons, [472]\r\nnamed Calonaghapi) would both belong to the king of Spagnia; and for\r\nthe honor of his king he was ready to fight to the death, and when he\r\ncould no longer resist, he would go to Spagnia with all his family in a\r\njunk [473] which he was having built new, carrying the royal signature\r\nand banner; and therefore he was the king\xe2\x80\x99s servant for a long time.\r\nHe begged us to leave him some men so that he might constantly be\r\nreminded of the king of Spagnia. He did not ask for merchandise because\r\nthe latter would not remain with him. [474] He told us that he would go\r\nto an island called Bachian, in order sooner to furnish the ships with\r\ncloves, for there were not enough dry cloves in his island to load the\r\ntwo ships. As that day was Sunday, it was decided not to trade The\r\nfestive day of those people is our Friday.\r\n\r\nIn order that your most illustrious Lordship may know the islands where\r\ncloves grow, they are five, [namely], Tarenatte, Tadore, Mutir,\r\nMachian, and Bachian. Tarenate is the chief one, and when its king was\r\nalive, he ruled nearly all the others. Tadore, the one where we were,\r\nhas a king. Mutir and Machian have no king but are ruled by the people,\r\nand when the two kings of Tarenate and of Tadore engage in war, those\r\ntwo islands furnish them with men. The last island is Bachian, and it\r\nhas a king. That entire province where cloves grow is called Malucho.\r\n[475] At that time it was not eight months since one Francesco Seranno\r\n[476] had died in Tarenate. [He was] a Portuguese and the\r\ncaptain-general of the king of Tarenate and opposed the king of Tadore.\r\nHe did so well that he constrained the king of Tadore to give one of\r\nhis daughters to wife to the king of Tarenate, and almost all the sons\r\nof the chiefs as hostages. The above mentioned grandson of the king of\r\nTadore was born to that daughter. Peace having been made between the\r\ntwo kings, and when Francesco Seranno came one day to Tadore to trade\r\ncloves, the king of Tadore had him poisoned with the said betel leaves.\r\nHe lived only four days. His king wished to have him buried according\r\nto his law [i.e., with Mahometan rites], but three Christians who were\r\nhis servants would not consent to it. He left a son and a daughter,\r\nboth young, born by a woman whom he had taken to wife in Java Major,\r\nand two hundred bahars of cloves. He was a close friend and a relative\r\nof our royal captain-general, and was the cause of inciting the latter\r\nto undertake that enterprise, for when our captain was at Malacha, he\r\nhad written to him several times that he was in Tarenate. As Don\r\nManuel, then king of Portugal, refused to increase our\r\ncaptain-general\xe2\x80\x99s pension by only a single testoon per month for his\r\nmerits, the latter went to Spagnia, where he had obtained everything\r\nfor which he could ask from his sacred Majesty. [477] Ten days after\r\nthe death of Francesco Seranno, the king of Tarenate, by name, Raya\r\nAbuleis, having expelled his son-in-law, the king of Bachian, was\r\npoisoned by his daughter, the wife of the latter king, under pretext of\r\ntrying to bring about peace between the two kings. The king lingered\r\nbut two days, and left nine principal sons, whose names are Chechili\r\nMomuli, Jadore Vunighi, Chechili de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cili Pagi,\r\nChialin, Chechilin Cathara, Vaiechu Serich, and Calano Ghapi. [478]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, November xi, one of the sons of the king of Tarenate, [to\r\nwit], Chechili de Roix, came to the ships clad in red velvet. He had\r\ntwo praus and his men were playing upon the abovementioned gongs. He\r\nrefused to enter the ship at that time. He had [charge of] the wife and\r\nchildren, and the other possessions of Francesco Seranno. When we found\r\nout who he was, we sent a message to the king, asking him whether we\r\nshould receive Chechili de Roix, since we were in his port, and he\r\nreplied to us that we could do as we pleased. But the son of the king,\r\nseeing that we were hesitating, moved off somewhat from the ships. We\r\nwent to him with the boat in order to present him an Indian cloth of\r\ngold and silk, and some knives, mirrors, and scissors. He accepted them\r\nsomewhat haughtily, and immediately departed. He had a Christian Indian\r\nwith him named Manuel, the servant of one Petro Alfonso de Lorosa,\r\n[479] a Portuguese who went from Bandan to Tarenate, after the death of\r\nFrancesco Seranno. As the servant knew how to talk Portuguese, he came\r\naboard our ship, and told us that, although the sons of the king of\r\nTarenate were at enmity with the king of Tadore, yet they were always\r\nat the service of the king of Spagnia. We [480] sent a letter to Pietro\r\nAlfonso de Lorosa, through his servant, [telling him] that he could\r\ncome without any hesitation.\r\n\r\nThose kings have as many women as they wish, but only one chief wife,\r\nwhom all the others obey. The abovesaid king of Tadore had a large\r\nhouse outside of the city, where two hundred of his chief women lived\r\nwith a like number of women to serve them. When the king eats, he sits\r\nalone or with his chief wife in a high place like a gallery whence he\r\ncan see all the other women who sit about the gallery; and he orders\r\nher who best pleases him to sleep with him that night. After the king\r\nhas finished eating, if he orders those women to eat together, they do\r\nso, but if not, each one goes to eat in her own chamber. No one is\r\nallowed to see those women without permission from the king, and if\r\nanyone is found near the king\xe2\x80\x99s house by day or by night, he is put\r\nto death. Every family is obliged to give the king one or two of its\r\ndaughters. That king had twenty-six children, eight sons, and the rest\r\ndaughters. Lying next that island there is a very large island, called\r\nGiailolo [i.e., Gilolo], which is inhabited by Moros and heathens. Two\r\nkings are found there among the Moros, one of them, as we were told by\r\nthe king, having had six hundred children, and the other five hundred\r\nand twenty-five. [481] The heathens do not have so many women; nor do\r\nthey live under so many superstitions, but adore for all that day the\r\nfirst thing that they see in the morning when they go out of their\r\nhouses. The king of those heathens, called Raya Papua, is exceedingly\r\nrich in gold, and lives in the interior of the island. Reeds as thick\r\naround as the leg and filled with water that is very good to drink,\r\ngrow on the flinty rocks in the island of Giaiallo. [482] We bought\r\nmany of them from those people.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, November twelve, the king had a house built for us in the\r\ncity in one day for our merchandise. We carried almost all of our goods\r\nthither, and left three of our men to guard them. We immediately began\r\nto trade in the following manner. For x brazas of red cloth of very\r\ngood quality, they gave us one bahar of cloves, which is equivalent to\r\nfour quintals and six libras; for fifteen brazas of cloth of not very\r\ngood quality, one quintal and one hundred libras; for fifteen hatchets,\r\none bahar; for thirty-five glass drinking-cups, one bahar (the king\r\ngetting them all); for seventeen cathils of cinnabar, one bahar; for\r\nseventeen cathils of quicksilver, one bahar; for twenty-six brazas of\r\nlinen, one bahar; for twenty-five brazas of finer linen, one bahar; for\r\none hundred and fifty knives, one bahar; for fifty pairs of scissors,\r\none bahar; for forty caps, one bahar; for x pieces of Guzerat cloth,\r\n[483] one bahar; for three of those gongs of theirs, two bahars; [484]\r\nfor one quinta of bronze [metalo], one bahar. [Almost] all the mirrors\r\nwere broken, and the few good ones the king wished for himself. Many of\r\nthose things [that we traded] were from the abovementioned junks which\r\nwe had captured. Our haste to return to Spagnia made us dispose of our\r\nmerchandise at better bargains [to the natives] than we should have\r\ndone. [485] Daily so many boatloads of goats, fowls, figs [i.e.,\r\nbananas], cocoanuts, and other kinds of food were brought to the ships,\r\nthat we were surprised. We supplied the ships with good water, which\r\nissues forth hot [from the ground], but if it stands for the space of\r\nan hour outside its spring, it becomes very cold, the reason therefor\r\nbeing that it comes from the mountain of cloves. This is quite the\r\nopposite from the assertion in Spagnia that water must be carried to\r\nMaluco from distant parts. [486]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the king sent his son, named Mossahap, to Mutir, so that\r\nthey might supply us more quickly. On that day we told the king that we\r\nhad captured certain Indians. The king thanked God heartily, and asked\r\nus to do him the kindness to give him their persons, so that he might\r\nsend them back to their land, with five of his own men, in order that\r\nthey might make the king of Spagnia and his fame known. Then we gave\r\nhim the three women who had been captured in the queen\xe2\x80\x99s name for the\r\nreason already advanced. Next day, we gave the king all the prisoners,\r\nexcept those from Burne, for which he thanked us fervently. Thereupon,\r\nhe asked us, in order thereby to show our love for him, to kill all the\r\nswine that we had in the ships, in return for which he would give us an\r\nequal number of goats and fowls. We killed them in order to show him a\r\npleasure, [487] and hung them up under the deck. When those people\r\nhappen to see any swine they cover their faces in order that they might\r\nnot look upon them or catch their odor.\r\n\r\n(Continued in Vol. XXXIV, page 39.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[Note: In the following notes, citations from Richard Eden are made\r\nfrom Arber\xe2\x80\x99s reprint The first three English books on America\r\n(Birmingham, 1885), from the third book, entitled The decades of the\r\nnewe worlde, first printed in London in 1555; from Mosto, from Il primo\r\nviaggio, intorno al globo di Antonio Pigafetta, by Andrea da Mosto\r\n(Roma, 1894), which was published as a portion of part v of volume iii\r\nof Raccolta di documenti e studi pubblicati dalla R. Commissione\r\nColombiana pel quarto centenario dalla scoperta dell\xe2\x80\x99America,\r\nappearing under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction; and\r\nfrom Stanley, from his First voyage round the world, by Magellan\r\n(Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1874), which was translated by\r\nLord Stanley in part from the longer French MS. in the Biblioth\xc3\xa8que\r\nNationale, Paris, and in part from the Amoretti publication (Milan,\r\n1800) made from the Italian MS. in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana.]\r\n\r\n[1] The greater part of the life of Antonio Pigafetta is shrouded in\r\ndarkness. The Pigafetta family, who resided at Venice, and was formerly\r\nof Tuscan origin, dates back before him for several centuries. The\r\nPigafetta escutcheon was white above and black below with a white\r\ntransverse bar running from left to right. On the lower part were three\r\nred roses, one of them on the bar. The old family house is still\r\nstanding and shows the motto Il nest rose sans espine, i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cNo rose\r\nwithout a thorn,\xe2\x80\x9d which was probably carved in 1481, when the house\r\nwas repaired, and not by Antonio Pigafetta after his return from his\r\nvoyage as some assert. Antonio Pigafetta was born toward the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century, but the date cannot be positively fixed, some\r\ndeclaring it to be 1491; but Harrisse who follows Marzari, gives the\r\ndate as 1480. It is unknown who his parents were and some have asserted\r\nthat he was a natural child, although this is evidently unfounded, as\r\nhe was received into the military order of St. John. At an early age he\r\nprobably became familiar with the sea and developed his taste for\r\ntraveling. He went to Spain with the Roman ambassador Chieregato, in\r\n1519, but in what capacity is unknown. Hearing details of\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s intended voyage he contrived to accompany him. Navarrete\r\nsurmises that he is the Antonio Lombardo mentioned in the list of the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s servants and volunteers who sailed on the expedition, so\r\ncalled as his country was Lombardy. After the return of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictoria,\xe2\x80\x9d he journeyed in Spain, Portugal, and France, and\r\nreturned to Italy probably in January, 1523. The relation presented by\r\nhim to C\xc3\xa1rlos I was probably a draft of his notes taken daily\r\nthroughout the voyage. His Relation as we know it was undertaken at the\r\nrequest of the marchioness of Mantova, but its composition was arrested\r\nby an order from Clement VII to come to Rome, whither he went in\r\nDecember, 1523, or January, 1524, meeting Villiers l\xe2\x80\x99Isle-Adam on his\r\njourney thither. He remained in the pope\xe2\x80\x99s service but a short time,\r\nfor in April, 1524, he was back in Venice. That same year he was\r\ngranted a copyright on his Relation, which he intended to print, for\r\ntwenty years. Pozzo says that he was received into the Order of St.\r\nJohn, October 3, 1524, but it was probably somewhat before that date.\r\nBetween the dates of August, 1524, and August, 1530, his work was\r\npresented to Villiers l\xe2\x80\x99Isle-Adam. Nothing further is known of him,\r\nthough some say that he fought against the Turks as late as 1536, while\r\nothers have placed his death in 1534 or 1535 and at Malta. In addition\r\nto his Relation Pigafetta wrote a Treatise on the art of navigation,\r\nwhich follows his Relation. This is not presented in the present\r\npublication, notwithstanding its importance, as being outside of the\r\npresent scope. It is reproduced by Mosto. He has sometimes been\r\nconfused with Marcantonio Pigafetta (a Venetian gentleman), the author\r\nof Itinerario da Vienna a Constantinopoli (London, 1585); and wrongly\r\ncalled Vincenzo Antonio Pigafetta, the \xe2\x80\x9cVincenzo\xe2\x80\x9d being an error\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cvicentino,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cVenetian.\xe2\x80\x9d See Mosto, Il primo viaggio\r\n... di Antonio Pigafetta (Roma, 1894), pp. 13\xe2\x80\x9330; Larousse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDictionnaire; and La grande Encyclop\xc3\xa9die (Paris).\r\n\r\n[2] The Order of St. John of Jerusalem. See Vol. II, p. 26, note 2.\r\nThroughout this Relation Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s spelling of proper names is\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n[3] Philippe de Villiers l\xe2\x80\x99Isle-Adam, the forty-third grand master of\r\nthe Order of the Knights of St. John (called Knights of Malta after\r\n1530), was born of an old and distinguished family at Beauvais, in\r\n1464, and died at Malta, August 21, 1534, at grief, some say, over the\r\ndissensions in his order. He was elected grand master of his order in\r\n1521 and in the following year occurred his heroic defense of Rhodes\r\nwith but four thousand five hundred soldiers against the huge fleet and\r\narmy of Soliman. After six months he was compelled to surrender his\r\nstronghold in October, and refusing Soliman\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties to remain\r\nwith him, went to Italy. In 1524 he was given the city of Viterbe by\r\nClement VII, where in June of 1527 he held a general chapter of his\r\norder, at which it was decided to accept the island of Malta which had\r\nbeen offered by Charles V. The gift was confirmed by the letters-patent\r\nof Charles V in 1530, and Villiers l\xe2\x80\x99Isle-Adam Adam went thither in\r\nOctober of that year. He was always held in high esteem for his\r\nbravery, prudence, and piety. See Moreri\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionaire, and\r\nLarousse\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionnaire.\r\n\r\n[4] The four MSS. of Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s Relation are those known as the\r\nAmbrosian or Italian, so called from its place of deposit, the\r\nBiblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan; no. 5,650, conserved in the\r\nBiblioth\xc3\xa8que Nationale, Paris, in French; no. 24,224, in the same\r\nlibrary, also in French; and the Nancy MS. (also French) so called\r\nbecause it was conserved in Nancy, France, now owned by the heirs of\r\nSir Thomas Phillips, Cheltenham, England. The MSS. of the Biblioth\xc3\xa8que\r\nNationale are both shorter than the Italian MS. The Nancy MS. is said\r\nto be the most complete of the French manuscripts. The best\r\nbibliographical account of these four MSS. that has yet appeared is by\r\nMosto ut supra. A full bibliographical account of both the MSS. and\r\nprinted books will be given in the volume on bibliography in this\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of radical differences between the Paris MS. no.\r\n5,650 (which will be hereafter referred to simply as MS. 5,650) and the\r\nItalian MS., these differences including paragraph structure and the\r\ndivision of MS. 5,650 into various chapters, although the sequence is\r\non the whole identical. The most radical of the differences will be\r\nshown in these notes. MS. 5,650 contains the following title on the\r\npage immediately preceding the beginning of the relation proper:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNavigation and discovery of Upper Indie, written by me, Anthoyne\r\nPigaphete, a Venetian, and knight of Rhodes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[5] The emperor Charles V; but he was not elected to that dignity until\r\nJune, 1519. Pigafetta writing after that date is not explicit.\r\n\r\n[6] Francesco Chiericati was born in Venice, in one of the most ancient\r\nand famous families of that city, at the end of the fifteenth century.\r\nHe attained pre\xc3\xabminence at Sienna in both civil and ecclesiastical\r\nlaw. Aided by Cardinal Matteo Lang, bishop of Sion, he was received\r\namong the prelates of the apostolic palace. Later he conducted several\r\ndiplomatic missions with great skill. He left Rome for Spain in\r\nDecember, 1518, on a private mission for the pope, and especially to\r\neffect a crusade against the Turks who were then invading Egypt and\r\nthreatening Christianity. His house at Barcelona became the\r\nmeeting-place of the savants of that day who discussed literature and\r\nscience. See Mosto, p. 19, note 3.\r\n\r\n[7] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cscholars and men of understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[8] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cso that I might satisfy the wish of the said\r\ngentlemen and also my own desire, so that it could be said that I had\r\nmade the said voyage and indeed been an eyewitness of the things\r\nhereafter written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[9] See Vol. I, p. 250, note 192 for sketch of Magalh\xc3\xa3es. The only\r\nadequate life of Magalh\xc3\xa3es in English is that of Guillemard.\r\n\r\n[10] That is, the Order of Santiago. See Vol. I, p. 145, note 171.\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es and Falero were decorated with the cross of comendador of\r\nthe order by C\xc3\xa1rlos I in the presence of the royal Council in July,\r\n1518. See Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Ferdinand Magellan, p. 114.\r\n\r\n[11] See Vol. I for various documents during the period of the\r\npreparation of the fleet; also Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Magellan, pp. 114\xe2\x80\x93116\r\nand 130\xe2\x80\x93134; and Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s First Voyage, pp. xxxiv\xe2\x80\x93xlvi.\r\n\r\n[12] Pope Clement VII, who assumed the papacy November 19, 1523.\r\nPigafetta was summoned to Rome very soon after Clement\xe2\x80\x99s election,\r\nfor he was in Rome either in December, 1523, or January, 1524.\r\n\r\n[13] The Amoretti edition (Milan, 1800; a wofully garbled adaptation of\r\nthe Italian MS.) wrongly ascribes this desire to Clement VII, instead\r\nof Villiers L\xe2\x80\x99Isle-Adam. See Stanley, p. 36, note 3.\r\n\r\n[14] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cFinally, most illustrious Lordship, after all\r\nprovisions had been made and the ships were in readiness, the\r\ncaptain-general, a wise and virtuous man, and one mindful of his honor,\r\nwould not commence his voyage without first making some good and\r\nsuitable rules, such as it is the approved custom to make for those who\r\ngo to sea, although he did not entirely declare the voyage that he was\r\nabout to make lest those men, through astonishment and fear, should\r\nrefuse to accompany him on the so long voyage that he had determined\r\nupon. In consideration of the furious and violent storms that reign on\r\nthe Ocean Sea where he was about to sail, and in consideration of\r\nanother reason also, namely, that the masters and captains of the other\r\nships in his fleet had no liking for him (the reason for which I know\r\nnot, unless because he, the captain-general, was a Portuguese, and they\r\nSpaniards or Castilians, who have for a long while been biased and\r\nill-disposed toward one another, but who, in spite of that, rendered\r\nhim obedience), he made his rules such as follow, so that his ships\r\nmight not go astray or become separated from one another during storms\r\nat sea. He published those rules and gave them in writing to every\r\nmaster in the ships and ordered them to be inviolably observed and\r\nkept, unless for urgent and legitimate excuse, and the proof that any\r\nother action was impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[15] A Spanish word, meaning \xe2\x80\x9clantern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[16] Mosto wrongly derives strengue from the Spanish trenza \xe2\x80\x9cbraid\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9ctwist.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead it is the Spanish word estrenque, which denotes\r\na large rope made from Spanish grass hemp (stipa)\xe2\x80\x94known to the\r\nSpaniards as esparto. MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes he set out a\r\nlantern; at other times a thick rush cord which was lighted and was\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x98trenche\xe2\x80\x99 [i.e., \xe2\x80\x98estrenque,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98rope of Spanish grass\r\nhemp\xe2\x80\x99].\xe2\x80\x9d Barcio (Diccionario general etimol\xc3\xb3gico) says that the\r\norigin of estrenque is unknown.\r\n\r\n[17] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cIf he wished the other ships to haul in a\r\nbonnet-sail, which was a part of the sail attached to the mainsail, he\r\nshowed three lights. Also by three lights notwithstanding that the\r\nweather might be favorable for making better time, it was understood\r\nthat the bonnet-sail was to be hauled in, so that the mainsail might be\r\nsooner and easier struck and furled when bad weather came suddenly in\r\nany squall or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[18] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich he had extinguished immediately after;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand continues: \xe2\x80\x9cthen showing a single light as a sign that he\r\nintended to stop there and wait until the other ships should do as\r\nhe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[19] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cthat is to say, a rock in the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[20] Stanley translates the following passage wrongly. Rightly\r\ntranslated, it is: \xe2\x80\x9cAlso when he desired the bonnet-sail to be\r\nreattached to the sail, he showed three fires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[21] This passage is omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[22] Hora de la modorra is in Spanish that part of the night\r\nimmediately preceding the dawn. Mosto, p. 52, note 8.\r\n\r\n[23] Contra maestro (boatswain) corresponding to the French\r\ncontrema\xc3\xaetre and the Spanish contramaestre, was formerly the third\r\nofficer of a ship\xe2\x80\x99s crew. Nochiero (French nocher) was the officer\r\nnext to contramaestre, although the name, according to Littr\xc3\xa9 was\r\napplied to the master or seacaptain of certain small craft. The maestro\r\n(French ma\xc3\xaetre) was a sub-officer in charge of all the crew. The pilot\r\nwas next to the captain in importance. The translator or adapter who\r\nmade MS. 5,650 confuses the above officers (see following note).\r\n\r\n[24] The instructions pertaining to the different watches are as\r\nfollows in MS. 5,650: \xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to the said rules for carrying on\r\nthe art of navigation as is fitting, and in order to avoid the dangers\r\nthat may come upon those who do not have watches set, the said captain,\r\nwho was skilled in the things required and in navigation, ordered three\r\nwatches to be set. The first was at the beginning of the night; the\r\nsecond at midnight; and the third toward daybreak, which is commonly\r\ncalled the \xe2\x80\x98diane\xe2\x80\x99 [i.e., \xe2\x80\x98morn\xe2\x80\x99] or otherwise \xe2\x80\x98the star of\r\ndawn.\xe2\x80\x99 The abovenamed watches were changed nightly: that is to say,\r\nthat he who had stood first watch stood second the day following, while\r\nhe who had stood second, stood third; and thus did they continue to\r\nchange nightly. The said captain ordered that his rules, both those of\r\nsignals and of watches, be thoroughly observed, so that their voyage\r\nmight be made with the greatest of safety. The men of the said fleet\r\nwere divided into three divisions: the first was that of the captain;\r\nthe second that of the pilot or boatswain\xe2\x80\x99s mate; and the third that\r\nof the master. The above rules having been instituted, the\r\ncaptain-general determined to depart, as follows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[25] See Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Magellan, pp. 329\xe2\x80\x93336, and Navarrete, Col. de\r\nviages, iv, pp. 3\xe2\x80\x9311, 162\xe2\x80\x93188, for the stores and equipments of the\r\nfleet and their cost. The stores carried consisted of wine, olive oil,\r\nvinegar, fish, pork, peas and beans, flour, garlic, cheese, honey,\r\nalmonds, anchovies, raisins, prunes, figs, sugar, quince preserves,\r\ncapers, mustard, beef, and rice. The apothecary supplies were carried\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad,\xe2\x80\x9d and the ecclesiastical ornaments in that ship\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[26] The exact number of men who accompanied Magalh\xc3\xa3es is a matter of\r\ndoubt. A royal decree, dated Barcelona, May 5, 1519, conserved in the\r\npapers of the India House of Trade in Archivo general de Indias at\r\nSevilla, with pressmark est. 41, caj. 6, leg. 2\xe2\x80\x9325, orders that only\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-five persons sail in the fleet. The same\r\narchives contain various registers of the fleet (sec Llorens\r\nAscensio\xe2\x80\x99s Primera vuelta al mundo, Madrid, 1903), one of which is\r\npublished by Medina in his Colecci\xc3\xb3n (i, p. 113). Guillemard\r\n(Magellan, p. 326) says that at least two hundred and sixty-eight men\r\nwent as is shown by the official lists and \xe2\x80\x9cthe casual occurrence of\r\nnames in the numerous and lengthy autos fiscales connected with the\r\nexpedition.\xe2\x80\x9d Guillemard conjectures that the total number must have\r\nbeen between two hundred and seventy and two hundred and eighty. Mosto\r\n(p. 53, note 2) says: \xe2\x80\x9cCastanheda and Barros say that the crews\r\namounted to 250 men, while Herrera says 234. Navarrete\xe2\x80\x99s lists show a\r\ntotal of 265 men. At least 37 were Portuguese, and in addition to them\r\nand the Spaniards, the crews contained Genoese and Italians (thirty or\r\nmore), French (nineteen), Flemings, Germans, Sicilians, English,\r\nCorfiotes, Malays, Negroes, Moors, Madeirans, and natives of the Azores\r\nand Canary Islands. But seventeen are recorded from Seville, while\r\nthere are many Biscayans. (See Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 326\xe2\x80\x93329.)\r\nThe registers of men as given by Navarrete (Col. de viages, iv, pp.\r\n12\xe2\x80\x9326) are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrinidad\r\n\r\n(Flagship

From some of these registers, it appears that the\r\nfollowing men were also in the fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapacity        Name                        Nationality\r\nCarpenter       Aroca                       Viscayan\r\nSteward         Blas Alfonso                Portuguese\r\nCalker          Juan Gutierrez\r\n                Maestre Pedro [73]\r\nSailor          Bautista Genov\xc3\xa9s            G\xc3\xa9nova\r\nCommon seaman   Perucho de Bermeo\r\nCommon seaman   Domingo Alvarez\r\nCommon seaman   Domingo Gonzalez\r\nCommon seaman   Domingo de Zubillan [74]    Portuguese\r\nCommon seaman   Andres Blanco\r\nCommon seaman   Antonio Gomez               Axio\r\nCommon seaman   Juan Portugu\xc3\xa9s [i.e., a Portuguese]\r\nCommon seaman   Juan Bras\r\nCommon seaman   Gonzalo Gallego\r\nCommon seaman   Rodrigo de Hurrira\r\n                Sebastian Portugu\xc3\xa9s [i.e., a Portuguese]\r\n                Juan de Ircepais\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSobresalientes\r\n\r\n      Secular priest    Pero Sanchez de Reina\r\n                        Licentiate Morales\r\n                        Hernando Rodriguez\r\n                        Hartiga\r\n                        Diugurria\r\n      Soldier           Diego Arias           Sanl\xc3\xbacar\r\n      Blacksmith        Juan Hernandez        Triana\r\n      Servant of Luis   Hernando de Aguilar\r\n      de Mendoza\r\n                        The negro of the pilot Juan\r\n                        Carballo\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition there were probably others, this list being still three\r\nshort of Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s figures, 268. Harrisse (Disc. of N. Amer.,\r\nLondon and Paris, 1892, pp. 714 et seq.) gives a partial list.\r\n\r\n[27] The Moorish name of Guadalquivir (from Arabic W\xc3\xa2d-al-Kebir,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe great river\xe2\x80\x9d), superseded the Roman name of B\xc3\xa6tis. The Romans\r\nformed all Southern Spain into one province called B\xc3\xa6tica after the\r\nname of the B\xc3\xa6tis. By the town Gioan dal Farax is meant San Juan de\r\nAznalfarache (from Moorish Hisn al-Faradj). Its Gothic name was Osset\r\nand its Roman name Julia Constantia. It is a favorite resort of the\r\ninhabitants of Sevilla. Cor\xc3\xada was once a Roman potters\xe2\x80\x99 town and is\r\nstill celebrated for its jars. San L\xc3\xbacar de Barrameda was named in\r\nhonor of St. Luke. It was captured from the Moors in 1264 and granted\r\nto the father of Guzman el Bueno. It attained importance after the\r\ndiscovery of America because of its good harbor. The house of\r\nMedina-Sidonia was founded by Alfonso P\xc3\xa9rez de Guzman, a famous\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n[28] The original of this passage is obscure. The distance given (ten\r\nleagues; and both MS. 5,650 and Eden agree substantially with it) is\r\nfar too short for the distance between San Lucar and Cape St. Vincent,\r\nwhich is over one hundred miles. Pigafetta may have forgotten the\r\nactual distance, or it may have been an error of his amanuensis. It is\r\npossible to translate as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich lies in 37 degrees of\r\nlatitude, [that parallel being] x leguas from the said port;\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clongui\xe2\x80\x9d may be taken as agreeing with \xe2\x80\x9cgradi.\xe2\x80\x9d In all\r\nrendering of distances, the Spanish form will be used in preference to\r\nthe Italian; and the same will apply to the names of Spanish coins.\r\n\r\n[29] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd after passing many small villages along\r\nthe said river, we at last reached a chateau belonging to the duke of\r\nMedinacidonia, and called Sainct Lucar, where there is a port with an\r\nentrance into the Ocean Sea. One enters that port by the east wind, and\r\nleaves by the west. Nearby is the cape of Sainct Vincent, which,\r\naccording to cosmography, lies in a latitude of thirty-seven degrees at\r\na distance of twenty miles from the said port. From the said city [of\r\nSevilla] to the said port by the river abovesaid, the distance is\r\nthirty-five or forty miles.\xe2\x80\x9d This passage might be cited as a proof\r\nthat Pigafetta did not translate or write the French version, but that\r\nthe work was done by another, who takes various liberties with his\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n[30] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cfurnish the fleet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[31] Ninguna in original, a Spanish word.\r\n\r\n[32] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise called \xe2\x80\x98labeiche.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Labech\r\n(Italian libeccio) is simply a name for the southwest wind. This is\r\nanother instance in which the French adapter adds an explanation to the\r\nItalian, thus explaining the Italian term garbino, \xe2\x80\x9csouthwest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[33] MS. 5,650 reads wrongly: \xe2\x80\x9csixteenth.\xe2\x80\x9d The so-called Genoese\r\npilot (the author of the \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro,\xe2\x80\x9d by which name his account will\r\nbe hereafter designated, and concerning whom, see Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMagellan, p. 145, and Mosto, p. 32, and note 4) gives the date of\r\ndeparture as September 21 (with which Barros agrees) and the arrival at\r\nTenerife as the twenty-ninth (see Stanley, p. 1). Peter Martyr, Gomara,\r\nand Oviedo agree with Pigafetta, while Castanheda makes the departure\r\nin January, 1520. Hughes observes that if one keep in mind the\r\ncircumstance that the day of the arrival coincided with the day\r\ndedicated by the Church to St. Michael, the date September 29 seems\r\nmore admissible. However, one may reconcile the two dates of the\r\narrival by observing that the ships stopped at Tenerife until October\r\n2; while Herrera says that the ships fetched Monta\xc3\xb1a Roja (the Monte\r\nrosso of the text) on September 29. See Mosto, p. 53, notes 4 and 5. It\r\nshould be noted that Gomara and Oviedo are not entirely trustworthy\r\nauthorities, and that many times they have simply copied from\r\nauthorities, such as Maximilianus Transylvanus, who is not always to be\r\nrelied upon.\r\n\r\n[34] The Canaries were known to the ancients under the names of Islands\r\nof the Blest, Fortunate Islands, and the Hesperides. The Moors knew of\r\nthem under the name of Islands of Khaledat, but had no practical\r\nacquaintance with them. In the fourteenth century these islands began\r\nto be known to Europeans, especially through the Portuguese. In 1402,\r\nthe Frenchman Jean de Bethencourt went there, and shortly after began\r\ntheir conquest under the auspices of the crown of Castile. In\r\nconsequence of the settlements made by Bethencourt, the islands were\r\ndefinitely ceded to Spain in 1481 (see Birch\xe2\x80\x99s Alboquerque, London,\r\n1875\xe2\x80\x931884, Hakluyt Society Publications, ii, p. vi). The inhabitants\r\nof the islands were known as Guanches or Guanchinet, the latter meaning\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmen of Tenerife.\xe2\x80\x9d The inhabitants of this island, holding out\r\nlonger than the others, were not subdued until 1496. See also Conquest\r\nof Canaries (London, 1877); and History and Description of Africa\r\n(London, 1896), i, pp. 99\xe2\x80\x93101: both publications of the Hakluyt\r\nSociety. The island of Tenerife was formerly called Nivana and by some\r\nthe Island of Hell. Like all the other islands of the Canaries it is\r\nvolcanic in formation, and its peak, the Teyde, is one of the largest\r\nvolcanic cones known. Its latitude is 28\xc2\xb0 15\xe2\x80\xb2.\r\n\r\n[35] Guillemard conjectures that this is Punta Roxa, located at the\r\nsouth end of Tenerife.\r\n\r\n[36] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is a substance needed by ships.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHerrera says that they waited three days at the port awaiting a caravel\r\nthat was laden with pitch for the fleet (Mosto, p. 53, note 8).\r\n\r\n[37] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cwater coming from spring or river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[38] Eden (p. 250) adds to this account which he greatly abridges:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lyke thynge is al\xc5\xbfo \xc5\xbfcene in the Iland of \xc5\xbfaynt Thomas,\r\nlyinge directly vnder the Equinoctiall lyne.\xe2\x80\x9d Of this island of\r\nHierro, Pory (History and description of Africa, Hakluyt Society\r\nedition, p. 100) says: \xe2\x80\x9cHierro hath neither spring nor well, but is\r\nmiraculously furnished with water by a cloud which over-spreadeth a\r\ntree, from whence distilleth so much moisture, as sufficeth both for\r\nmen and cattel. This cloud ariseth an hower or two before the sunne,\r\nand is dissolued two howers after sunne rising.\xe2\x80\x9d This is an old story\r\nand is related by Pliny and founded upon fact \xe2\x80\x9cfor both in Madeira\r\nand the Canaries the laurel and other heavy-foliaged evergreens\r\ncondense abundant water from the daily mists\xe2\x80\x9d (Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMagellan, p. 149). Gregorio Chil y Naranio (Estudios hist\xc3\xb3ricos ... de\r\nlas islas Canarias, 1879) believes Pigafetta means here the island of\r\nPalma, and that the first navigators visited only the coast and so did\r\nnot see the lake in the interior (Mosto, p. 53, note 9).\r\n\r\n[39] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich the sailors of the east call\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cyroc\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d This is the Italian sirocco, which is the name for the\r\nsoutheast wind instead of the south. Herrera says they left the port\r\nOctober 2 (Mosto, p. 54, note 2).\r\n\r\n[40] Eden (p. 250) reads incorrectly: \xe2\x80\x9cIn this coa\xc5\xbft they had no\r\nmaner of contrary wynds but a great calme and fayre wether for the\r\n\xc5\xbfpace of three \xc5\xbfcore and tenne dayes, in the which they came vnder\r\nthe Equinoctiall lyne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[41] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand of those persons who have sailed there\r\noften.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[42] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in order that our ships might not be\r\nwrecked or broach to (which often happens when the squalls come\r\ntogether).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[43] This last phrase, as well as the two following sentences are\r\nmissing in MS. 5,650. The third sentence following begins: \xe2\x80\x9cDuring\r\nthe calm weather, large fish called tiburoni,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. The word\r\ntiburoni, \xe2\x80\x9csharks\xe2\x80\x9d is from the Spanish tiburon, which comes from\r\nthe French tib\xc3\xa9ron (tiburin, tiburon).\xe2\x80\x94Echagaray\xe2\x80\x99s Diccionario\r\nEtimol\xc3\xb3gico (Madrid, 1889).\r\n\r\n[44] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe said fish are caught by means of a\r\ncontrivance which sailors call \xe2\x80\x98hame\xe2\x80\x99 which is an iron fishhook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHame (ain) is the French form of the Italian Amo, meaning\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfishhook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[45] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the bad weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[46] MS. 5,650 reads \xe2\x80\x9ca quarter of an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d and the same duration\r\nof time is given by Eden (p. 250).\r\n\r\n[47] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be noted that whenever that fire that\r\nrepresents the said Saint Anselme ascends and descends the mast of a\r\nship while in a storm at sea, that the said ship is never wrecked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHerrera (cited by Mosto, p. 54, note 5) says that St. Elmo appeared on\r\nthe masthead with a lighted candle and sometimes two during the storms\r\nencountered along the coasts of Guinea, and that the sailors were\r\ngreatly comforted thereby, and saluted the saint as is the custom of\r\nseamen. When he appeared, he remained a quarter of an hour; and at his\r\ndeparture a great flash of light occurred which blinded all the men.\r\nEden (p. 250) calls it the fire of St. Helen. Continuing, Eden injects\r\ninto his abridgment of the first circumnavigation a description of St.\r\nElmo\xe2\x80\x99s fire by Hieronimus Cardanus in the second book of De\r\nSubtilitate. He says: \xe2\x80\x9cOf the kynde of trewe fyer, is the fyer baule\r\nor \xc5\xbftarre commonly cauled \xc5\xbfaynt Helen which is \xc5\xbfumtyme \xc5\xbfeene abowt\r\nthe ma\xc5\xbftes of \xc5\xbfhyppes, beinge of \xc5\xbfuche fyery nature that it\r\n\xc5\xbfumetyme melteth bra\xc5\xbfen ve\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfels, and is a token of drownyng,\r\nfora\xc5\xbfmuch as this chaunceth only in great tempe\xc5\xbftes. For the vapoure\r\nor exhalation whereof this fyre is engendered, can not bee dryven\r\ntogyther or compacte in forme of fyre, but of a gro\xc5\xbfe vapoure and by a\r\ngreat poure of wynde, and is therfore a token of imminent perell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe fires called after St. Peter and St. Nicholas are on the contrary,\r\nhe says, good omens, and are generally to be seen on the cables, after\r\na storm. Being little and swift moving they can do no damage as they\r\ncould do if massed and of slow movement. St. Elmo\xe2\x80\x99s fire is the\r\npopular name for the atmospheric electricity that gathers in the form\r\nof a star or brush about the masthead of ships and on the rigging. It\r\nwas sometimes accompanied by a hissing noise and was considered as a\r\ngood omen by sailors. The Greeks who observed this phenomenon wove it\r\ninto the Castor and Pollux myth; and the French edition of\r\nPigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s relation published by Simon de Colines has the passage\r\n(see Mosto, p. 54): \xe2\x80\x9cThey saw the fires called Sainct Eline and\r\nSainct Nicolas like blazing torches (whom the ancients called Castor\r\nand Pollux).\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cElmo\xe2\x80\x9d is said by some to be a corruption of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelena,\xe2\x80\x9d the sister of Castor and Pollux, and the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHellene\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cHelen\xe2\x80\x9d was often given to the fire when only one\r\nlight was visible. It is, however, more probably derived from St. Elmo,\r\nbishop of Formine who died about 304, and who is invoked by sailors on\r\nthe Mediterranean. The phenomenon is also called fire of \xe2\x80\x9cSt.\r\nElias,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Clara,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Nicolas,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomposite,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccomposant,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccorposant (i.e., corpus sanctum).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[48] The second bird mentioned is the stormy petrel (of the family\r\nLarid\xc3\xa6 and genus Thalassidroma), which is found along all the Atlantic\r\ncoasts and on some of the Pacific. The tale of the text was current\r\namong sailors (see Wilkes, U. S. Exploring Expedition, viii, pp. 402,\r\n403). The cagassela (\xe2\x80\x9ccagaselo\xe2\x80\x9d in MS. 5,650) is the Stercorarius\r\nparasiticus, called also the jaeger, and by sailors \xe2\x80\x9cboatswain,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cteaser,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdung-hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d The last name arose from the\r\nbelief, long held even by scientists, that this bird fed on the dung of\r\ngulls and terns. In reality it pursues the latter birds and compels\r\nthem to disgorge the fish that they have swallowed. The flying-fish is\r\neither a species of Exoc\xc5\x93tus, or the Scomberesox saurus of Europe and\r\nAmerica, both of which feed in large schools and jump from the water to\r\nescape their enemies.

The first names of the country were Vera\r\nCruz and Santa Cruz. Cape Santo Agostinho, mentioned below, lies in 8\xc2\xb0\r\n21\xc2\xb4 south latitude, and is the most eastern headland of South America.\r\nIt was the first land of that continent to be discovered, being sighted\r\nat least as early as 1500 by Pinzon. Before sighting the above cape,\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es arrested Juan de Cartagena for insubordination and gave the\r\ncommand of the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d to Antonio de Coca (see Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMagellan,  p. 153). Albo\xe2\x80\x99s log begins slightly before the sighting of\r\nthe point, his first entry being November 29. See Burton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntroduction\xe2\x80\x9d in his Captivity of Hans Stade (Hakluyt Society\r\npublications, London, 1874).\r\n\r\n[51] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cveal.\xe2\x80\x9d The anta is the tapir, once very\r\nplentiful in South America, but now rare in the well civilized\r\ndistricts. See Burton\xe2\x80\x99s Captivity of Hans Stade, p. viii. Albo,\r\nhowever, seems to designate the llama by this name, for he says when\r\nspeaking of the stay at Bay St. Julian: \xe2\x80\x9cand many Indians came there,\r\nwho are clad in certain skins of antas, which resemble camels without\r\nthe hump.\xe2\x80\x9d (Navarrete, Col. de viages, iv, p. 214).\r\n\r\n[52] Stanley mistranslates the French phrase of MS. 5,650 et est de la\r\nlongueur dun naveau, \xe2\x80\x9cand is of the length of a shuttle,\xe2\x80\x9d confusing\r\nnaveau with navette, \xe2\x80\x9cshuttle.\xe2\x80\x9d Naveau here is equivalent to navet,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cturnip\xe2\x80\x9d or navette, \xe2\x80\x9crape,\xe2\x80\x9d a plant of the turnip class, as is\r\nproved by the Italian.\r\n\r\n[53] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for a king of cards, of the kind which are\r\nused to play with in Italy, they gave me five fowls.\xe2\x80\x9d The four suits\r\nof Italian playing cards are called spade (\xe2\x80\x9cswords\xe2\x80\x9d), bastoni\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cclubs\xe2\x80\x9d), danari (literally: \xe2\x80\x9cmoney;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdiamonds\xe2\x80\x9d), and\r\ncoppe (\xe2\x80\x9ccups\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\r\n[54] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cfive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[55] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is an astrological term. That zenith is a\r\npoint in the sky, according to astrologers, but only in the\r\nimagination, and is in a straight line over our head, as can be seen by\r\nthe treatise of the sphere, and in Aristotle, in the first book De\r\ncaelo et mondo.\xe2\x80\x9d By the treatise of the sphere is evidently meant the\r\ntreatise of Pigafetta which follows his relation, and which is not\r\nreproduced here as being outside the scope of the present work. In the\r\nflyleaf of the Italian original is the following: \xe2\x80\x9cNotices concerning\r\nthe new world, with the charts of the countries discovered, written by\r\nAntonio Pigafeta, Venetian and knight of Rodi. At the end are added\r\nsome rules for finding the longitude and latitude of places east and\r\nwest.\xe2\x80\x9d In the Italian MS. this treatise occupies the last twelve\r\nfolios. Stanley translates Amoretti\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Treatise, which\r\nis greatly abridged. Mosto (p. 35) conjectures that the treatise is the\r\nfruits of his three-years\xe2\x80\x99 experience during the expedition.\r\n\r\n[56] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 210) says that the fleet continued to\r\ncoast southwest from November 29 until arriving at St. Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s bay on\r\nDecember 13 (St. Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s day). Of the coast he says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe mountains\r\nare peaked and have many reefs about them. There are many rivers and\r\nports in the said Brasil and San Tom\xc3\xa9, and some six leguas down the\r\ncoast there are many bays running two leguas into the land. But the\r\ncoast runs northeast and southwest to Cape Frio, and has many islands\r\nand rivers. Cape Frio is a very large river.... At the entrance of the\r\nsaid bay is a very large bay, and at the mouth a very low island, and\r\ninside it spreads out extensively and has many ports ... and is called\r\nthe bay of Santa Luc\xc3\xada.... In the said bay, one finds a well-disposed\r\nand numerous race, who go naked and trade for fishhooks, mirrors, and\r\nhawk\xe2\x80\x99s bells with food.... We entered that place on the very day of\r\nSt. Lucy, and stayed there until the day of St. John, namely, the\r\ntwenty-seventh of the said month of December. On that day we went and\r\ntook our course west southwest, and found seven islands. To the right\r\nof them is a bay called the bay of Los Reyes [i.e., the Kings] which\r\nhas a good entrance.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 1) says: \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nsoon as they sighted the other coast of Brazil, he steered to the\r\nsouth-east [sic] along the coast as far as Cabo-frio, which is in\r\ntwenty-three degrees south latitude; and from this cape he steered to\r\nthe west, a matter of thirty leagues, to make the Rio de Janeiro, which\r\nis in the same latitude as Cabo-frio, and they entered the said river\r\non the day of St. Lucy, which was the 13th December, in which place\r\nthey took in wood, and they remained there until the first octave of\r\nChristmas, which was the 26th of December of the same year.\xe2\x80\x9d Brito\r\n(Navarrete, iv, p. 306) says: \xe2\x80\x9cSetting sail thence [i.e., from\r\nTenerife], the first land sighted was the cape of the shoals of Ambas.\r\nThey descended the coast as far as the river called Janeiro, where they\r\nstayed 15 or 16 days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[57] Eden (p. 251) says: \xe2\x80\x9cbygger then all Spayne, Portugale, Fraunce,\r\nand Italie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[58] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cmore like beasts than anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[59] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd some of those people live to the age of\r\none hundred, one hundred and twenty, one hundred and forty, or more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEden (p. 251) says: \xe2\x80\x9cC.xx. and C.xl. yeares.\xe2\x80\x9d For description of\r\nthe Brazil Indians, and their manners and customs, see Captivity of\r\nHans Stade (Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 117\xe2\x80\x93169.\r\n\r\n[60] Wrongly transcribed by Stanley as \xe2\x80\x9cboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[61] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know that a family of one hundred\r\npersons, who make a great racket, lives in each of those houses called\r\nboii.\xe2\x80\x9d One of these houses (called Oca, in Tupi) is described by\r\nWilson (Transactions of Ethnological Society, new series, vol. i) as\r\nbeing \xe2\x80\x9c60 or 70 feet long, divided into rooms for several families by\r\nrush mats, and provided with a central fire whose smoke passed through\r\nthe roof. Some of them contained 200 head.\xe2\x80\x9d See Burton\xe2\x80\x99s Captivity\r\nof Hans Stade, pp. 59, 60, note.

This was Jo\xc3\xa3o Carvalho (the Juan Lopez Caraballo of\r\nthe register\xe2\x80\x94see note 26, ante). Carvalho was a Portuguese, of none\r\ntoo scrupulous morals, even in his age, as appears later in\r\nPigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s narrative. After the fatal banquet in the island of\r\nCeb\xc3\xba, he became the leader of the remaining men of the fleet, but was\r\nlater deposed (see post, note 441). He remained behind with the\r\nill-fated \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad,\xe2\x80\x9d and never returned to Europe. His son, borne\r\nto him by a native woman of Brazil, was left behind in Borneo.

See Jesuit Relations\r\nand Allied Documents (Cleveland reissue).\r\n\r\n[69] Eden (p. 45), defines gatti mammoni as monkeys. Monkeys of the\r\ngenus Cebus are probably meant (Mosto, p. 55, note 8).\r\n\r\n[70] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cfresh cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d Pigafetta may here refer to\r\nthe bread made from the casava or manioc root. See Burton\xe2\x80\x99s Captivity\r\nof Hans Stade, pp. 130\xe2\x80\x93132, for a description of the method of\r\npreparing this root.\r\n\r\n[71] The swine mentioned by Pigafetta is the Tayasu (Taga\xc3\xa7u), or\r\npeccari (Dicotyles torquatus), which has quills resembling those of the\r\nporcupine, and is generally of a whitish color. It is tailless and very\r\nfierce and difficult to domesticate. The flesh was eaten; and the teeth\r\nwere worn by some of the chiefs as necklaces. Burton (ut supra), p.\r\n160, note.\r\n\r\n[72] The Platalea ajaja or rosy spoonbill, belonging to the family of\r\nthe Plataleid\xc3\xa6, whose habitat extends through all of tropical and\r\nsubtropical America, including the West Indies, south to the Falkland\r\nIslands, Patagonia and Chile, and north to the southern part of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[73] Hans Stade (Burton, ut supra) testifies to the chastity of the\r\npeople of Eastern Brazil among whom he lived as a prisoner.\r\n\r\n[74] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe women attend to the outside affairs, and\r\ncarry everything necessary for their husband\xe2\x80\x99s food in small panniers\r\non the head or fastened to the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[75] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[76] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we departed they gave us a very great\r\nquantity of verzin;\xe2\x80\x9d and adds: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a color which comes from\r\ntrees which grow in the said country, and so abundantly, that the\r\ncountry is called Verzin from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[77] MS. adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich was a piece of great simplicity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[78] This sentence is preceded by the following in MS. 5,650:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides the abovesaid which proclaims their simplicity, the people\r\nof the above place showed us another very simple thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[79] This passage in Stanley reads as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful young\r\ngirl came one day inside the ship of our captain, where I was, and did\r\nnot come except to seek for her luck: however, she directed her looks\r\nto the cabin of the master, and saw a nail, of a finger\xe2\x80\x99s length, and\r\nwent and took it as something valuable and new, and hid it in her hair,\r\nfor otherwise she would not have been able to conceal it, because she\r\nwas naked, and, bending forwards, she went away; and the captain and I\r\nsaw this mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d The matter between the words \xe2\x80\x9clength\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnaked\xe2\x80\x9d is taken from MS. 24,224 (wrongly declared by Stanley to be\r\nthe copy of his travels presented to the regent Louise by Pigafetta,\r\nthe conclusion being based on the fact that some of the details are\r\nsoftened down), as Stanley considered the incident as told in MS.\r\n5,650, the Italian MS. and the first French edition, as unfit for\r\npublication. Stanley cites the following (in the original) from the\r\nedition of 1536 which omits the above story: \xe2\x80\x9cAt the first land at\r\nwhich we stopped, some female slaves whom we had brought in the ships\r\nfrom other countries and who were heavy with child, were taken with the\r\npains of childbirth. Consequently, they went alone out of the ships,\r\nwent ashore, and after having given birth, returned immediately to the\r\nships with their infants in their arms.\xe2\x80\x9d He also cites the following\r\npassage from the first French printed edition, which also narrates the\r\nabove story of the girl: \xe2\x80\x9cAt the first coast that we passed, some\r\nslave women gave birth. When they were in travail, they left the boat,\r\nafter which they immediately returned, and nursed their children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStanley adds that this story of the slave women is improbable, as women\r\nwere not allowed to come aboard ship.\r\n\r\n[80] MS. 5,650 gives the words of the Brazil as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cmaiz, huy,\r\npinda, taesse, chignap, pirame, itenmaraca, tum maraghatom.\xe2\x80\x9d Amoretti\r\n(see Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s edition, p. 48) reads tacse as tarse and itanmaraca as\r\nHanmaraca. Stanley mistranslates the French forcette (\xe2\x80\x9cscissors\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cfork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[81] Eden says (p. 251): \xe2\x80\x9cxxxiiii. degree and a halfe toward the pole\r\nAntartike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[82] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cand to ask whether the others might come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[83] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThat place was formerly called Cape Saincte\r\nMarye and it was thought that one could pass thence to the sea of Sur,\r\nthat is to say the South Sea, but it has not been ascertained that any\r\nships have ever discovered anything farther on.\xe2\x80\x9d Eden (p. 251) reads:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbowt the mouth of this ryuer are \xc5\xbfeven ilandes, in the bygge\xc5\xbft\r\nwhereof, they founde certeyne precious \xc5\xbftones, and cauled it the cape\r\nof Saynt Marie. The Spanyardes thought that by this ryuer they might\r\nhaue pa\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfed into the \xc5\xbfouth \xc5\xbfea. But they were deceaued in theyr\r\nopinion. For there was none other pa\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfage than by the ryuer which is\r\nxvii. leagues large in the mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d This river was the Rio de la\r\nPlata. The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 2) says that Magalh\xc3\xa3es left Rio\r\nde Janeiro December 26, proceeding to the cape Santa Mar\xc3\xada and the\r\nriver which was called St. Christopher. There they remained until\r\nFebruary 2, 1520. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 211) also mentions the river\r\nwhich he calls the \xe2\x80\x9criver of Sol\xc3\xads.\xe2\x80\x9d The ships sent to look for a\r\nstrait through the river were gone two days, and a careful exploration\r\nof the mouth of the river was made. Brito (Navarrete, iv, pp. 306, 307)\r\nsays: \xe2\x80\x9cThey left that place [i.e.,  Rio de Janeiro] and coasted along\r\nshore until they reached the river called Sol\xc3\xads, where Fernando\r\nMagallanes thought that he could find a strait. They stayed there forty\r\ndays. Magallanes ordered the ship \xe2\x80\x98Santiago\xe2\x80\x99 to sail forward for\r\nabout 50 leguas to see whether there was any passage. Not finding a\r\npassage, he crossed the river which is about 25 leguas wide and found\r\nthe [opposite] coast which runs northeast and southwest.\xe2\x80\x9d For early\r\nhistory of this region, see Dominguez\xe2\x80\x99s Conquest of the River Plata.\r\n\r\n[84] Juan Diaz de Solis, a famous Spanish navigator, was born at\r\nLebrixa, in 1470. He is said, although without sufficient authority, to\r\nhave discovered Yucatan with Pinzon in 1506. He was appointed chief\r\npilot of Spain after the death of Amerigo Vespucci in 1512. In October,\r\n1515, he sailed in command of an expedition in search of a southwest\r\npassage to India. He discovered Rio de la Plata which he explored as\r\nfar as the region of the Charrua tribe, by whom he and some of his men\r\nwere killed and eaten before September, 1516. The remnant of the\r\nexpedition was conducted back to Spain by his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n[85] Eden adds (p. 251): \xe2\x80\x9cwhich \xc5\xbfum thynke to bee tho\xc5\xbfe fy\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfhes\r\nthat wee caule pikes.\xe2\x80\x9d Below, the sea-wolf is described as having a\r\nhead \xe2\x80\x9cof golden coloure.\xe2\x80\x9d They were probably some species of the\r\nOtariid\xc3\xa6 or fur-seals (Giullemard, p. 160, note). The \xe2\x80\x9cgeese\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\npenguins. Albo, Herrera, and others, also mention the \xe2\x80\x9csea-wolves and\r\nducks.\xe2\x80\x9d Kohl (Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft f\xc3\xbcr Erdkunde, xi, 362)\r\nsays that this bay where the ships were laden with the seals and\r\npenguins is probably Desvelos Bay, but it is more probably Puerto\r\nDeseado (\xe2\x80\x9cPort Desire;\xe2\x80\x9d see Mosto, p. 57, note 2). Drake also\r\nsecured fresh provisions from these \xe2\x80\x9csea-wolves,\xe2\x80\x9d calling the bay\r\nwhere he secured them \xe2\x80\x9cSeale Bay.\xe2\x80\x9d See World Encompassed (Hakluyt\r\nSociety edition), pp. 54, 55.\r\n\r\n[86] Port St. Julian. The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d pilot (Stanley, p. 3) says that\r\nthey reached it on March 31, 1520, and places it in 49\xc2\xb0 20\xc2\xb4 south\r\nlatitude. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 214) says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe went to a port\r\ncalled San Julian, where we entered the last day of March, and where we\r\nstayed until the day of St. Bartholomew. The said port lies in a\r\nlatitude of 49 and two-thirds degrees. We pitched the ships in that\r\nport.\xe2\x80\x9d Other writers give slightly different locations (see Mosto, p.\r\n57, note 5). Antonio Brito, the Portuguese, whose MS. is preserved in\r\nthe Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, writes in 1523 to the king of Portugal\r\ncertain news obtained from some of the men of the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\ninformation as might be expected, is at times faulty. Of Port St.\r\nJulian, he says: \xe2\x80\x9cThey coasted along shore until they reached a river\r\ncalled San Juan where they wintered for four months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[87] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cjumping up and down.\xe2\x80\x9d The only reference made\r\nto the Patagonians by Albo is as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cMany Indians came there,\r\nwho dress in certain skins of the anta, which resemble camels without\r\nthe hump. They have certain bows made from cane, which are very small\r\nand resemble turkish bows. The arrows also resemble Turkish arrows, and\r\nare tipped with flint instead of iron. Those Indians are very prudent,\r\nswift runners, and very well-built and well-appearing men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Navarrete, iv, pp. 214, 215).

S. Exploring Expedition, 1838\xe2\x80\x931842), i, facing p.\r\n95. The latter describes Indians, whom the officers of the expedition\r\nthought to be Patagonians, and who were taller than average Europeans,\r\nas follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThey had good figures and pleasant looking countenances,\r\nlow foreheads, and high cheekbones, with broad faces, the lower part\r\nprojecting; their hair was course and cut short on the crown leaving a\r\nnarrow border of hair hanging down; over this they wore a kind of cap\r\nor band of skin or woolen yarn. The front teeth of all of them were\r\nvery much worn, more apparent, however, in the old than in the young.\r\nOn one foot they wore a rude skin sandal. Many of them had their faces\r\npainted in red and black stripes, with clay, soot, and ashes. Their\r\nwhole appearance, together with their inflamed and sore eyes, was\r\nfilthy and disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d They showed that they had had previous\r\ncommunication with white men. Their food was fish and shellfish, and\r\nthey carried bows and arrows and had dogs. Brinton (American Race, New\r\nYork, 1891) says that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Patagonians call themselves Chonek or\r\nTzoneca, or Inaken (men, people), and by their Pampean neighbors are\r\nreferred to as Tehuel-Che, southerners.\xe2\x80\x9d Many of them are \xe2\x80\x9cfrom six\r\nto six feet four inches in height, and built in proportion. In color\r\nthey are a reddish brown, and have aquiline noses and good\r\nforeheads.\xe2\x80\x9d Ramon Lista (Viage al pais de los Tehuel-Ches) gives the\r\naverage height of the Patagonians as 1.854 m., hence the early accounts\r\nof their great stature are greatly exaggerated (Mosto, p. 57, note 6).\r\nSee also the description of the Patagonians in the \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Stanley, p. 5); and World encompassed by Sir Francis Drake (Hakluyt\r\nSociety edition), pp. 40, 56\xe2\x80\x9361 (where the origin of the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatagonian\xe2\x80\x9d is wrongly given).\r\n\r\n[90] The guanaco, a species of llama.

The name \xe2\x80\x9cCingani\xe2\x80\x9d or Zingari, as they are\r\ngenerally called in Italy, comes from the Greek word t>asigqanoi, by\r\nwhich they were called by Byzantine writers of the ix\xe2\x80\x93xii centuries;\r\nthe same name appearing also in slightly different forms in Turkey,\r\nBulgaria, Roumania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Germany. Their ancestral home\r\nwas probably in northwestern India, whence they emigrated in successive\r\nwaves. In many countries extreme and harsh measures were taken against\r\nthem, especially in Germany, where they had appeared as early as 1417.\r\nThey were never allowed a foothold in France, but have become a\r\nsignificant part of the population in Russia, Hungary, and Spain. In\r\nthe latter country, where they are called Git\xc3\xa1nos (Egyptians), in\r\nspite of many severe laws passed against them until the reign of\r\nC\xc3\xa1rlos III, they continued, more fortunate than the Jews, to thrive.\r\nThey are mentioned by Cervantes in his Don Quixote (pt. i, chap, xxx),\r\nbut the name Git\xc3\xa1no had first appeared in a Spanish document of 1499,\r\nwhere their customs are described. The few in Italy have been allowed\r\nto remain, and those in the Slavic countries and England were generally\r\ntreated kindly. Their language is Aryan and was highly inflected; and\r\nwhile they have been given many names by the nations among whom they\r\nhave lived, their own appellation is \xe2\x80\x9cRom\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe man.\xe2\x80\x9d See New\r\nInternational Encyclopedia (New York, 1903).\r\n\r\n[117] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9ccapae;\xe2\x80\x9d but Stanley has mistranscribed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccapac.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[118] \xe2\x80\x9cAlbo (Navarrete iv, p. 215), the \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p.\r\n4), Transylvanus and Oviedo (Mosto, p. 59, note 3) give the date of\r\ndeparture from Port San Julian August 24, 1520; but the second errs in\r\ngiving 5\xc2\xbd instead of 4\xc2\xbd months for the period for which the fleet\r\nremained there. Peter Martyr places the date of departure as August 21.\r\nCastanheda, who gives the same date says that the name \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Julian\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cof the ducks\xe2\x80\x9d was given to that bay which he calls a river.\r\nBarros gives the date of arrival as April 2, and says that the place\r\nwas called \xe2\x80\x9criver of Sa\xc3\xb5 Juli\xc3\xa3o.\xe2\x80\x9d See Mosto, ut supra.\r\n\r\n[119] A portion of the passage relating to the attempted mutiny reads\r\nas follows in MS. 5,650: \xe2\x80\x9cHowever the treason was discovered, and as\r\na consequence the treasurer was killed by a dagger and then quartered.\r\nGaspar de Casada was beheaded and then quartered. The overseer trying\r\nshortly after to lead another mutiny, was banished together with a\r\npriest and set ashore on that land of Pathagonia.\xe2\x80\x9d The Italian MS. is\r\nbadly confused, while the above is more in accordance with the facts,\r\nand shows the hand of the translator and adapter. Eden (p. 252) says of\r\nthe attempted mutiny: \xe2\x80\x9cThey remayned fyue monethes in this porte of\r\nSainte Iulian, where certeyne of the vnder capitaynes con\xc5\xbfpirynge the\r\ndeath of theyr general, were hanged and quartered: Amonge whom the\r\ntrea\xc5\xbfurer Luigo of Mendozza was one. Certeyne of the other\r\ncon\xc5\xbfpirators, he left in the \xc5\xbfayd land of Patogoni.\xe2\x80\x9d See the short\r\naccount of the mutiny given by Transylvanus in Vol. I, p. 317, and the\r\naccount given in the same volume, pp. 297, 299. The Roteiro (Stanley,\r\np. 3) says that three of the ships revolted against Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaying that they intended to take him to Castile in arrest, as he was\r\ntaking them all to destruction;\xe2\x80\x9d but Magalh\xc3\xa3es subdued the mutiny by\r\nthe aid of the foreigners with him. Mendoza was killed by Espinosa the\r\nchief constable of the fleet, and Gaspar Quesada was beheaded and\r\nquartered. Alvaro de Mesquita, Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, is wrongly\r\nreported to have been given command of one of the ships of those\r\nkilled, but the command of the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d that had previously\r\nbeen given to Antonio de Coca, after Magalh\xc3\xa3es had deprived Cartagena\r\nof it, had been given him before the real outbreak of the mutiny.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the mutiny as given by Navarrete (Col. de viages, iv,\r\npp. 34\xe2\x80\x9338) which was compiled mainly from documents presented in the\r\nsame volume and from Herrera, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarch 31, the eve of Palm Sunday, Magallanes entered the port of San\r\nJulian, where he intended to winter, and consequently ordered the\r\nrations to be served by measure. In view of that and of the barrenness\r\nand cold of the country, the men asked Magallanes by various arguments\r\nto increase the rations or turn back, since there was no hope of\r\nfinding the end of that country or any strait. But Magallanes replied\r\nthat he would either die or accomplish what he had promised; that the\r\nking had ordered the voyage which he was to accomplish; and that he had\r\nto sail until he found that land or some strait which must surely\r\nexist; that in regard to the food, they had no reason to complain,\r\nsince that bay had an abundance of good fish, good water, many game\r\nbirds, and quantities of wood, and that bread and wine had not failed\r\nthem, nor would fail them if they would abide by the rule regarding\r\nrations. Among other observations, he exhorted and begged them not to\r\nbe found wanting in the valorous spirit which the Castilian nation had\r\nmanifested and showed daily in greater affairs; and offering them\r\ncorresponding rewards in the king\xe2\x80\x99s name. By such means did he quiet\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApril 1, Palm Sunday, Magallanes summoned all his captains,\r\nofficers, and pilots to go ashore to hear mass and afterward to dine in\r\nhis ship. Alvaro de la Mezquita, Antonio de Coca, and all the men went\r\nto hear mass. Louis de Mendoza, Gaspar de Quesada, and Juan de\r\nCartagena (the latter because he was a prisoner in Quesada\xe2\x80\x99s keeping)\r\ndid not go, however; and Alvaro de la Mezquita alone went to dine with\r\nMagallanes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the night, Gaspar de Quesada and Juan de Cartagena with about\r\nthirty armed men of the ship \xe2\x80\x98Concepcion\xe2\x80\x99 went to the \xe2\x80\x98San\r\nAntonio,\xe2\x80\x99 where Quesada requested that the captain, Alvaro de la\r\nMezquita, be surrendered to him, and told the crew of the ship to seize\r\nit, as they had already done with the \xe2\x80\x98Concepcion\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Victoria.\xe2\x80\x99 [He said] that they already knew how Magallanes had\r\ntreated and was treating them, because they had asked him to fulfil the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s orders; that they were lost men; and that they should help him\r\nmake another request of Magallanes, and if necessary, seize him. Juan\r\nde Elorriaga, the master of the \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio,\xe2\x80\x99 spoke in favor of\r\nhis captain, Alvaro de la Mezquita, saying to Gaspar de Quesada: \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsummon you, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name and that of the king, Don C\xc3\xa1rlos, to go to\r\nyour ship, for the present is no time to go through the ships with\r\narmed men; and I also summon you to release our captain.\xe2\x80\x99 Thereupon\r\nQuesada replied: \xe2\x80\x98Must our deed remain unaccomplished because of this\r\nmadman?\xe2\x80\x99 and drawing his dagger stabbed him four times in the arm,\r\nthus overawing the men. Mezquita was kept prisoner, Elorriaga was cared\r\nfor, Cartagena went to the ship \xe2\x80\x98Concepcion,\xe2\x80\x99 while Quesada\r\nremained in the \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus were Quesada, Cartagena, and\r\nMendoza masters of the three ships, \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Concepcion,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Victoria.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThereupon, they sent a message to Magallanes to the effect that they\r\nheld three ships and the small boats of all five at their disposal in\r\norder to require him to fulfil his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s provisions. They said\r\nthat they had done that in order that he might no longer illtreat them\r\nas he had done thitherto. If he would agree to fulfil his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders, they would obey his commands, and [said] that if they had\r\nthitherto treated him as a superior, they would thenceforth treat him\r\nas a master, and would be most respectful to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagallanes sent word to them to come to his ship, where he would\r\nhear them and do what was proper. They answered that they did not dare\r\ncome lest he illtreat them, but that he should go to the ship \xe2\x80\x98San\r\nAntonio,\xe2\x80\x99 where they would all assemble and decide definitely on what\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s orders commanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagallanes believing that boldness was more useful than meekness in\r\nthe face of such actions, determined to employ craft and force\r\ntogether. He kept the small boat of the ship \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99 which\r\nwas used for those negotiations, at his ship; and sent the alguacil,\r\nGonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, in the skiff belonging to his ship, to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Victoria,\xe2\x80\x99 with six men armed secretly and a letter for the\r\ntreasurer, Luis de Mendoza, in which he told the latter to come to the\r\nflagship. While the treasurer was reading the letter and smiling as if\r\nto say \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t catch me that way,\xe2\x80\x99 Espinosa stabbed him in the\r\nthroat, while another sailor stabbed him at the same instant on the\r\nhead so that he fell dead. Magallanes, being a man with foresight, sent\r\na boat under command of Duarte Barbosa, sobresaliente of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Trinidad\xe2\x80\x99 with fifteen armed men, who entering the \xe2\x80\x98Victoria\xe2\x80\x99\r\nflung the banner to the breeze without any resistance. That happened on\r\nApril 2. Then the \xe2\x80\x98Victoria\xe2\x80\x99 approached the flagship, and they\r\ntogether immediately approached the \xe2\x80\x98Santiago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the following day, the \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Concepcion\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhich were held by Quesada and Cartagena tried to put to sea, but it\r\nwas necessary for them to pass close to the flagship which stood\r\nfarthest out. The \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99 raised two anchors, and being in\r\ndanger with one, Quesada determined to free Alvaro de la Mezquita, whom\r\nhe held a prisoner in his ship, in order to send him to Magallanes to\r\narrange peace between them. Mezquita, however, told him that nothing\r\nwould be obtained. Finally, they arranged that when they set sail,\r\nMezquita should station himself forward and ask Magallanes as they\r\napproached his ship, not to fire and that they would anchor provided\r\naffairs would be settled favorably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore setting sail in the \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio,\xe2\x80\x99 where they were\r\nendangered, as it was night and the crew were asleep, the ship dragged\r\nand ran foul of the flagship. The latter discharged some large and\r\nsmall shots and men leaped aboard the \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99 crying, \xe2\x80\x98For\r\nwhom are you?\xe2\x80\x99 they responding, \xe2\x80\x98For the king, our sovereign, and\r\nyour Grace,\xe2\x80\x99 surrendered to Magallanes. The latter seized Quesada,\r\nthe accountant, Antonio de Coca, and other sobresalientes who had gone\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99 with Quesada. Then he sent to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Concepcion\xe2\x80\x99 for Juan de Cartagena and imprisoned him with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext day Magallanes ordered the body of Mendoza taken ashore and had\r\nit quartered, and Mendoza cried as a traitor. On the seventh, he\r\nordered Gaspar de Quesada beheaded and quartered with a like cry. That\r\nwas done by Quesada\xe2\x80\x99s own follower and sobresaliente, Luis de Molino,\r\nin order to save himself from hanging, for that sentence had been\r\npassed on him. Magallanes sentenced Juan de Cartagena and the lay\r\npriest, Pedro Sanchez de la Reina, who had been active in causing the\r\nmen to mutiny, to be marooned in that country. He pardoned more than\r\nforty men who merited death, as they were needed to work the ships, and\r\nso that he might not excite hard feelings by the severity of the\r\npunishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrito\xe2\x80\x99s account of the mutiny (Navarrete, iv, p. 307) is very brief\r\nand unsatisfactory: \xe2\x80\x9cIn that port the captains began to ask him where\r\nhe was taking them, especially one Juan de Cartagena, who said that he\r\nhad a royal cedula naming him as associate with Magallanes, as Rui\r\nFalero would also have been, had he been there. Then they tried to rise\r\nagainst Magallanes and kill him, and go back to Castilla or to Rodas.\r\nFrom that point they went to the river of Santa Cruz, where they\r\nendeavored to put their plan in execution. But when Magallanes\r\ndiscovered their ill-considered attempt, for the captains said that\r\nthey would kill him or take him prisoner, he ordered his ship armed and\r\nJuan de Cartagena arrested. As soon as the other captains saw their\r\nchief arrested they thought no longer of prosecuting their attempt.\r\nMagallanes, however, seized them all, for most of the crew were in his\r\nfavor. He sent the merino or alguacil to kill Luis de Mendoza with his\r\ndagger, for the latter refused to be arrested; while he had another\r\nnamed Gaspar Quesada beheaded. When they set sail, he left Juan de\r\nCartagena together with a secular priest ashore at a place where there\r\nwere no inhabitants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorrea (Stanley, pp. 247\xe2\x80\x93250) gives a different and imperfect account\r\nof the meeting.\r\n\r\nCf. with these accounts the one given by Guillemard (Magellan), pp.\r\n162\xe2\x80\x93174. When the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d deserted, Esteban Gomez is said\r\nto have rescued Cartagena and the priest. Jo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o (after the loss\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cSantiago\xe2\x80\x9d) was given command of the \xe2\x80\x9cConcepcion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMesquita of the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio,\xe2\x80\x9d and Duarte Barbosa of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictoria,\xe2\x80\x9d all Portuguese (Guillemard, ut supra, p. 179). It is\r\nrather singular that Sir Francis Drake should also have faced a mutiny\r\nin this same port, where Thomas Doughty was executed. That the history\r\nof Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s expedition was generally known is evident from the\r\nfollowing: \xe2\x80\x9cThe next day after, being the twentieth of June, wee\r\nharboured ourselues againe in a very good harborough, called by\r\nMagellan Port S. Julian, where we found a gibbet standing upon the\r\nmaine, which we supposed to be the place where Magellan did execution\r\nupon some of his disobedient and rebellious company.\xe2\x80\x9d World\r\nencompassed (Hakluyt Society edition), p. 234.\r\n\r\n[120] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-five leagues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[121] Instead of this last phrase, MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cand very little\r\nof that.\xe2\x80\x9d The account of the shipwreck and rescue as given here is\r\nvery confusing and inadequate. Cf. Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 175\xe2\x80\x93179,\r\nand Navarrete, iv, pp. 38, 39. One man was lost, namely, the negro\r\nslave of Jo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o. The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 4) gives the\r\nbriefest mention of it. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 307) says: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\r\nthis [i.e., the mutiny], they wintered for three months; and Magallanes\r\nagain ordered the ship \xe2\x80\x98Santiago\xe2\x80\x99 to go ahead in order to explore.\r\nThe ship was wrecked but all of its crew were saved.\xe2\x80\x9d Correa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount (Stanley, p. 250) is very short, and mentions that only the\r\nhull of the vessel was lost.\r\n\r\n[122] Mosto (p. 60, note 3) derives this word from the Spanish\r\nmejillon, a variety of cockle, which he thinks may be the Mytilus or\r\ncommon mussel.\r\n\r\n[123] See Vol. II, p. 34, note 5*.\r\n\r\n[124] Eden (p. 252) says: \xe2\x80\x9c52. degree ... lackynge a thyrde parte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[125] MS. 5,650 omits: \xe2\x80\x9cand the holy bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d and has in its place:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cby His grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[126] MS. 5,650 omits these last two words. The Italian form braccio is\r\nretained in view of these words; for the Spanish braza is a measure\r\nabout equivalent to the English fathom, while the braccio, although\r\nvarying in different cities, is near three palmos (spans) in length.\r\nThe term is, however, translated brasse (\xe2\x80\x9cfathom\xe2\x80\x9d) in MS. 5,650.\r\nMosto (p. 60, note 8), conjectures this fish to be the Eliginus\r\nmaclovinus. Of this fish, Theodore Gill, the well-known ichthyologist,\r\nsays in a letter of May 22, 1905: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Italian editor gave a shrewd\r\nguess in the suggestion that the fish in question was what was formerly\r\ncalled Eliginus maclovinus. The only vulgar name that I have been able\r\nto find for it is \xe2\x80\x98robalo,\xe2\x80\x99 and this name is applied to it by the\r\nSpanish-speaking people of both sides of South America. Like most\r\npopular names, however, it is very misleading. \xe2\x80\x98Robalo\xe2\x80\x99 is the\r\nSpanish name for the European bass, which is nearly related to our\r\nstriped bass or rock bass. To that fish the robalo of South America has\r\nno affinity or real resemblance, and belongs to a very different family\r\npeculiar to the southern hemisphere\xe2\x80\x94the Nototheniids. The so-called\r\nEliginus maclovinus (properly, Eliginops maclovinus) is the most common\r\nand widely distributed species and probably the one obtained by the\r\nfleet of Magalh\xc3\xa3es.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[127] Of the river Santa Cruz and the stay there, Albo (Navarrete, iv,\r\np. 215) says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe left that place [i.e., Port San Julian] on the 24th\r\nof the said month [of August] and coasted along to the southwest by\r\nwest. About 30 leguas farther on, we found a river named Santa Cruz,\r\nwhich we entered on the 26th of the same month. We stayed there until\r\nthe day of San Lucas, the 18th of the month of October. We caught many\r\nfish there and got wood and water. That coast extends northeast by east\r\nand southwest by west, and is an excellent coast with good\r\nindentations.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 4) places the river\r\nSanta Cruz twenty leagues from San Julian and in about 50\xc2\xb0. That\r\nnarrative says that the four remaining boats continued to pick up the\r\nwreckage of the \xe2\x80\x9cSantiago\xe2\x80\x9d until September 18. The name Santa Cruz\r\nwas said to have been given to the river because they entered it on\r\nSeptember 14, the day of the exaltation of the holy cross (see Stanley,\r\np. 4, note 4, and Mosto, p. 60, note 7), but Kohl (Mosto, ut supra)\r\nattributes the name to Jo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o who was near that river on May 3,\r\n1520, the day on which the church celebrates the feast of the finding\r\nof the holy cross. Navarrete (iv, p. 41) cites Herrera as authority for\r\nan eclipse of the sun that happened while at this river on October 11,\r\n1520. Guillemard (ut supra, pp. 187, 188) is disinclined to believe the\r\nreport, although he mentions an annular eclipse of the sun on October\r\n20, 1520, which was however not visible in Patagonia. Navarrete (ut\r\nsupra) says that Magalh\xc3\xa3es gave instructions to his captains here\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csaying that he would follow those coasts until finding a strait or\r\nthe end of that continent, even if he had to go to a latitude of 75\xc2\xb0;\r\nthat before abandoning that enterprise, the ships might be twice\r\nunrigged; and that after that he would go in search of Maluco toward\r\nthe east and east northeast, by way of the cape of Buena Esperanza and\r\nthe island of San Lorenzo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new chapter begins at this point in MS. 5,650, being simply headed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[128] The anonymous Portuguese who accompanied Duarte Barbosa says 53\xc2\xb0\r\n30\xc2\xb4; Barros, 52\xc2\xb0 56\xc2\xb4; Elcano, 54\xc2\xb0; and Albo, 52\xc2\xb0 30\xc2\xb4. Mosto, p.\r\n60, note 9.\r\n\r\n[129] MS. 5.650 has the words in brackets.\r\n\r\n[130] Eden (p. 252) says of the strait: \xe2\x80\x9cthey founde the \xc5\xbftraight\r\nnowe cauled the \xc5\xbftraight of Magellanus, beinge in \xc5\xbfum place C.x.\r\nleagues in length: and in breadth \xc5\xbfumwhere very large and in other\r\nplaces lyttle more than halfe a league in bredth.\xe2\x80\x9d Stanley (p. 57) is\r\nuncertain of the French et quasi autant de largeur moins de demye\r\nlieue, which is (translated freely) simply \xe2\x80\x9csomething like almost a\r\nhalf-league wide.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 7) says that the\r\nchannel \xe2\x80\x9cat some places has a width of three leagues, and two, and\r\none, and in some places half a league.\xe2\x80\x9d Transylvanus (Vol. I, p. 320)\r\ngives the width as two, three, five, or ten Italian miles; Gomara, two\r\nleagues or so; Barros, one league at the mouth, and the strait, from a\r\nmusket or cannon shot to one and one and one-half leagues; Castanheda,\r\nat the mouth as wide as two ships close together, then opening up to\r\none league; Peter Martyr, a sling-shot\xe2\x80\x99s distance in places. (Mosto,\r\np. 61, note 2.)\r\n\r\n[131] Proise or Proi (proy, proic) is an ancient Catalonian word\r\nmeaning the \xe2\x80\x9cbow moorings;\xe2\x80\x9d Cf. Jal, Glossaire naut\xc3\xacque (Mosto, p.\r\n61, note 3). The old Spanish word is \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xc3\xads,\xe2\x80\x9d which signifies both\r\nthe thing to which the ship is moored ashore, and the rope by which it\r\nis moored to the shore.\r\n\r\n[132] This passage is as follows in MS. 5,650: \xe2\x80\x9cThe said strait was a\r\ncircular place surrounded with mountains (as I have said), and the\r\nmajority of the sailors thought that there was no exit from it into the\r\nsaid Pacific Sea. But the captain-general declared that there was\r\nanother strait which led out, and that he knew that well, for he had\r\nseen it on a marine chart of the king of Portugal. That map had been\r\nmade by a renowned sailor and pilot, named Martin de Boesme. The said\r\ncaptain sent two of his ships forward\xe2\x80\x94one named the \xe2\x80\x98Sainct\r\nAnthoine,\xe2\x80\x99 and the other the \xe2\x80\x98Conception\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94in order that they\r\nmight look for and discover the exit from the said strait, which was\r\ncalled the cape de la Baya.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin de Behaim (Beham, Behem, Behemira, Behen, B\xc5\x93hem), B\xc2\x9chm) was\r\nborn about 1459 (some say also in 1430 or 1436) of a family originally\r\nfrom Bohemia, in Nuremberg, Germany, and died at Lisbon, July 29, 1506.\r\nHe was a draper in Flanders, 1477\xe2\x80\x931479, after which he went to Lisbon\r\n(1480) where he became acquainted with Columbus. In 1484 he was chosen\r\ngeographer of Diego Cam\xe2\x80\x99s expedition to Western Africa. On his\r\nreturn, he received the order of knighthood in the military order of\r\nChrist of Portugal; after which he went to the island of Fayal in the\r\nAzores where he became interested in colonization and agriculture, and\r\nmarried the daughter of the governor. In 1491 he returned to Germany,\r\nwhere he lived at Nuremberg until 1493, and where, at the request of\r\nhis townsmen, he constructed an immense globe on the information of\r\nPtolemy, Strabo, and others, which contains many errors (see facsimile\r\nin Guillemard), In 1493 he returned to Lisbon, and in 1494 to Fayal,\r\nwhere he remained until 1506, when he went to Lisbon. Many myths sprung\r\nup about him, such that he had visited America before Columbus and the\r\nstraits of Magellan before Magalh\xc3\xa3es, the latter of whom he may have\r\nknown at Lisbon. See Rose, New Biographical Dictionary (London, 1848);\r\nGrande Encyclop\xc3\xa9die (Paris, Lamirault et Cie.); and Guillemard, pp.\r\n73, 74.\r\n\r\nSee Guillemard (ut supra, pp. 189\xe2\x80\x93198) for a discussion of knowledge\r\nregarding the existence of a strait to the south of the American\r\ncontinent, prior to Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s discovery and passage of it.\r\nGuillemard, after weighing the evidence for and against, decides that\r\nthere may have been a \xe2\x80\x9cmore or less inexact knowledge of the\r\nexistence of some antarctic break \xe2\x80\x9cthat would allow access to the\r\neastern world.\r\n\r\n[133] Possession Bay, according to Mosto, p. 61, note 5, but Guillemard\r\n(pp. 199, 200) thinks it may have been Lomas Bay.\r\n\r\n[134] Probably Anegada Point to the northwest of Cape Orange.\r\n\r\n[135] The \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Narrows\xe2\x80\x9d or Primera Garganta, just beyond Anegada\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\n[136] Lago de los Estrechos, St. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s Bay, or Boucant Bay.\r\n\r\n[137] The \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Narrows\xe2\x80\x9d and Broad Reach.\r\n\r\n[138] MS. 5,650 does not mention the smoke signals.\r\n\r\n[139] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen near us they suddenly discharged a\r\nnumber of guns, whereat we very joyously saluted them with artillery\r\nand cries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[140] The first is the passage east of Dawson Island, which extends to\r\nthe northeast into Useless Bay and to the southeast into Admiralty\r\nSound. The second opening was the passage between the western side of\r\nDawson Island and Brunswick Peninsula.\r\n\r\n[141] Esteban Gomez was an experienced Portuguese navigator and pilot\r\nwith ambitions only less than those of Magalh\xc3\xa3es, his kinsman\r\n(Guillemard, p. 203). His desertion occurred probably in the first part\r\nof November, and was perhaps directly due to pique at what he\r\nconsidered lack of appreciation from Magalh\xc3\xa3es. Conspiring with\r\nGer\xc3\xb3nimo Guerra, the notary, who was elected captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cSan\r\nAntonio\xe2\x80\x9d they made off with that ship, and after imprisoning Alvaro\r\nde Mezquita, returned to Spain, anchoring at Sevilla May 6, 1521. There\r\nGomez was imprisoned after the return of the \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria,\xe2\x80\x9d but was\r\nliberated, and in 1524 proposed an expedition to discover a northwest\r\npassage. An expedition having been fitted out by C\xc3\xa1rlos I, he coasted\r\nFlorida and the eastern coast, as far as Cape Cod, and returned to\r\nSpain in 1525. See Grande Encyclop\xc3\xa9die; Navarrete, iv, pp. 42\xe2\x80\x9345,\r\nand 201\xe2\x80\x93208; and Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 203\xe2\x80\x93205.\r\n\r\nBrito\xe2\x80\x99s story of the exploration of the strait and the loss of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d (Navarrete, iv, pp. 307, 308) is as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nleft that place [i.e., the river of Santa Cruz] on October 20, and went\r\nto enter a strait of which they had no knowledge. The entrance of the\r\nstrait extends for about 15 leguas; and after they had entered, it\r\nseemed to them that it was all land-locked, and they accordingly\r\nanchored there. Magallanes sent a Portuguese pilot named Juan Carballo\r\nashore with orders to ascend a mountain in order to ascertain whether\r\nthere was any outlet. Carballo returned saying that it appeared\r\nland-locked to him. Thereupon Magallanes ordered the ships \xe2\x80\x98San\r\nAntonio\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Concepcion\xe2\x80\x99 to go in advance in order to\r\nexplore the strait. After having gone ahead for about 30 leguas, they\r\nreturned to tell Magallanes that the river went farther but that they\r\ncould not tell where it would take them. Upon receiving that\r\ninformation Magallanes weighed anchor with all three ships, and\r\nadvanced along the strait until reaching the point to which the others\r\nhad explored. Then he ordered the \xe2\x80\x98San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99 of which Alvaro de\r\nMezquito, his cousin, was captain, and Esteban Gomez, a Portuguese\r\npilot, to go ahead and explore a southern channel that opened in the\r\nstrait. That ship did not return to the others and it is not known\r\nwhether it returned to Castilla or whether it was wrecked. Magallanes\r\nproceeded with his remaining ships until he found an exit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCorrea\xe2\x80\x99s account of the desertion of the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d is as\r\nusual with him, inadequate, and evidently based on hearsay evidence\r\n(see Stanley, p. 250).\r\n\r\n[142] Literally \xe2\x80\x9cbrother;\xe2\x80\x9d but to be understood probably as the\r\nexpression cugino germano, \xe2\x80\x9ccousin german.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[143] MS. 5,650 begins this sentence as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cBut that ship lost\r\nits time, for the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[144] Guillemard (p. 206) conjectures from the records of Albo,\r\nPigafetta, and Herrera that the river of Sardines is Port Gallant which\r\nis located on the Brunswick Peninsula, opposite the Charles Islands.\r\nAlbo (Navarrete, iv, p. 215) says that after taking the course to the\r\nnorthwest they sailed about 15 leagues before anchoring.\r\n\r\n[145] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 216) says that the two capes at the exit\r\nof the strait were called Fermosa and Deseado, this latter being Cape\r\nPillar (see Guillemard, map facing p. 198).\r\n\r\n[146] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich were on the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[147] Jo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o, the brother of Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s staunchest friend\r\nFrancisco Serr\xc3\xa3o, and a firm supporter of the great navigator.\r\nPigafetta errs in calling him a Spaniard (see p. 183), though he may\r\nhave become a naturalized Spaniard, since the register speaks of him as\r\na citizen of Sevilla. One document (Navarrete, iv, p. 155) calls him a\r\nPortuguese pilot, and Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) a Castilian. He was\r\nan experienced navigator and captain, and had served under Vasco da\r\nGama, Almeida, and Albuquerque. Vasco da Gama (on his second voyage,\r\n1502\xe2\x80\x931503) made him captain of the ship \xe2\x80\x9cPomposa\xe2\x80\x9d which was built\r\nin Mozambique where he was left to attend to Portuguese affairs. On\r\nthis expedition he saw the coast of Brazil for the first time, for\r\nVasco da Gama\xe2\x80\x99s fleet, ere doubling the Cape of Good Hope, crossed to\r\nthe Brazilian coast, which they followed as far as Cape Santo\r\nAgostinho. He fought bravely in the battle of Cananor under Almeida\r\n(March 16, 1506, in which Magalh\xc3\xa3es also participated). He was chief\r\ncaptain of three caravels in August, 1510, in Eastern water, and was in\r\nthe Java seas in 1512, but must have returned to Portugal soon after\r\nthat, for he was there in 1513; although he seems to have been\r\nappointed clerk at the fortress of Calicut in the latter year. He\r\nembarked with Magalh\xc3\xa3es as captain and pilot of the \xe2\x80\x9cSantiago,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut after the wreck of that vessel near port San Julian was given\r\ncommand of the \xe2\x80\x9cConcepcion,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he later explored the strait.\r\nFailing to dissuade Magalh\xc3\xa3es from attacking the natives of Matan, he\r\nbecame commander, with Duarte Barbosa, of the fleet at Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, and was murdered by the Cebuans after the treacherous banquet\r\ngiven by them to the fleet. See Guillemard (ut supra), and Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nThree voyages of Vasco da Gama (Hakluyt Society publications, London,\r\n1869).\r\n\r\n[148] MS. 5,650 reads as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cSuch was the method ordered by the\r\ncaptain from the beginning, in order that the ship that happened to\r\nbecome separated from the others might rejoin the fleet.\xe2\x80\x9d Then it\r\nadds: \xe2\x80\x9cThereupon the crew of the said ship did what the captain had\r\nordered them and more, for they set two banners with their letters,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[149] \xe2\x80\x9cThe island of Santa Magdalena (Mosto, p. 62, note 11).\r\n\r\n[150] According to Guillemard the river of Isleo (or \xe2\x80\x9cof Islands\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\nis located on Brunswick Peninsula, and is identified with the port of\r\nSan Miguel, just east of the \xe2\x80\x9cRiver of Sardines;\xe2\x80\x9d the island where\r\nthe cross was planted would be one of the Charles Islands.\r\n\r\n[151] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 3) mentions that the day at the\r\nport of San Julian was about seven hours long; while the anonymous\r\nPortuguese (Stanley, p. 30) says that the sun only appeared for some\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfour hours each day\xe2\x80\x9d in June and July. Transylvanus says the\r\nnights in the strait were not longer than five hours.\r\n\r\n[152] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is the collateral wind between the east\r\nand south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[153] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand anchorages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[154] Various kinds of these umbelliferous parsley plants are still to\r\nbe found in Patagonia, where they are highly esteemed (Mosto, p. 63,\r\nnote 3).\r\n\r\n[155] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe that there is a more\r\nbeautiful country or a better strait than that.\xe2\x80\x9d See Albo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndescription of the strait, in Vol. I, pp. 264\xe2\x80\x93265; that of\r\nTransylvanus, Vol. I, pp. 319\xe2\x80\x93321; and that in World encompassed\r\n(Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 236, 237 (this last account also\r\nmentioning the difficulty of finding water sufficiently shallow for\r\nanchoring). The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that the\r\nstrait was called the \xe2\x80\x9cStrait of Victoria, because the ship\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Victoria\xe2\x80\x99 was the first that had seen it: some called it the\r\nStrait of Magalhaens because our captain was named Fernando de\r\nMagalhaens.\xe2\x80\x9d Castanheda says that Magalh\xc3\xa3es gave it the name of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbay of All Saints\xe2\x80\x9d because it was discovered on November 1; and\r\nSan Martin in his reply to Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s request for opinions\r\nregarding the continuance of the expedition calls it \xe2\x80\x9cchannel of All\r\nSaints:\xe2\x80\x9d but this name was first applied to only one gulf or one\r\nbranch and later extended to the entire channel. This name is found in\r\nthe instructions given for the expedition of Sebastian Cabot in 1527,\r\nand in the map made that same year at Sevilla by the Englishman Robert\r\nThorne. Sarmiento de Gamboa petitioned Felipe II that it be called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrait of the Mother of God.\xe2\x80\x9d It was also called \xe2\x80\x9cstrait of\r\nMartin Behaim.\xe2\x80\x9d The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that\r\nthe strait is 400 miles long. The \xe2\x80\x9cRoterio\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, pp. 7, 8)\r\nsays that it is 100 leagues in length, and that in traversing it, they\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csailed as long as it was daylight, and anchored when it was\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d Transylvanus (Vol. I, p. 320) gives the length as 100 Spanish\r\nmiles; Oviedo, 100 or 110 leagues; Herrera, 100 leagues, and twenty\r\ndays to navigate; Gomara, 110 to 120 leagues; Peter Martyr, 110\r\nleagues.

Certain words are left\r\nin Italian in MS. 5,650, which are as follows: la copa; alcalcagno;\r\n(Italian MS. al calcagno); homo squerzo (Italian MS. sguerco); a la\r\npignate (Italian MS. pigniata); alstruzzo vcelo (Italian MS. al seruzo\r\nucelo); and alcocinare (Italian MS. al co\xc3\xa7inare). Stanley offers this\r\nas proof that MS. 5,650 was written by Pigafetta, and not translated\r\nfrom his Italian, but it furnishes no evidence that Pigafetta even saw\r\nthe French version of his relation. It must be remembered that Stanley\r\ndid not himself see the Italian MS. but only the Amoretti mutilation of\r\nit (from which, and from MS. 5,650, he reproduces the vocabulary,\r\nwithout English translation); and hence bases his observations on that\r\nand the conjectures of its editor. Stanley points out the fact that\r\nAmoretti has omitted several words of this list, but they are all in\r\nthe Italian MS. A sad blunder has been made by Stanley in his\r\ntranscription of La pouldre dherbe qui mangent whose Patagonian\r\nequivalent is capac. He transcribes as follows: la pouldre d\xe2\x80\x99herbe\r\nwith Patagonian equivalent qui (which it is to be noted is only the\r\nwrong form of the French relative), and mangent with Patagonian\r\nequivalent capac, explaining mangent in a footnote as \xe2\x80\x9cFood, the root\r\nused as bread.\xe2\x80\x9d Stanley also makes the following mistranscriptions:\r\norescho for oresche (\xe2\x80\x9cnostrils\xe2\x80\x9d); canneghin for caimeghin (\xe2\x80\x9cpalm\r\nof the hand\xe2\x80\x9d); ochy for ochii (\xe2\x80\x9cbosom\xe2\x80\x9d); scancos for scaneos\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9ctesticles\xe2\x80\x9d); hou for hoii (\xe2\x80\x9cbuttocks\xe2\x80\x9d); ohoy for ohon\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cpulse\xe2\x80\x9d); cartschem for cartscheni (\xe2\x80\x9csole of the foot\xe2\x80\x9d); chol\r\nfor thol (\xe2\x80\x9cheart\xe2\x80\x9d); om for oni (\xe2\x80\x9cwind\xe2\x80\x9d); aschame for aschanie\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cearthen pot\xe2\x80\x9d); oamaghei for oamaghce (\xe2\x80\x9cto fight\xe2\x80\x9d); amet for\r\namel (\xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d); and ixecoles for jrocoles (\xe2\x80\x9cto cook\xe2\x80\x9d). Amoretti\r\nhas also made many errors (see Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s First Voyage, pp. 62, 63).\r\nMosto, who is on the whole a faithful transcriber, has sacancos as the\r\nPatagonian equivalent of a li testiculi; om jani for a li sui, the\r\ncorrect forms of the latter being jani and a li sui oui; and tcrechai\r\nfor the equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cred cloth.\xe2\x80\x9d Eden (p. 252) gives only the\r\nfollowing words: \xe2\x80\x9cbreade, Capar: water, Oli: redde clothe, Cherecai:\r\nred colour, Cheiche: blacke colour, Amel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMosto (p. 63, note 8) gives the following words from the vocabulary of\r\nthe Tehuel-ches compiled by the second lieutenant of the ship\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoncagli,\xe2\x80\x9d which correspond almost exactly with those given by\r\nPigafetta.\r\n\r\n\r\n             English   Roncagli   Pigafetta\r\n             Nose      or         or\r\n             eye       \xc3\xb3thel      other\r\n             hand      tz\xc3\xa9n       chene\r\n             ear       sha        sane\r\n             ostrich   \xc3\xb3yue       hoi hoi\r\n\r\n\r\nBrinton (American Race, p. 328) cites Ramon Lista (Mis exploraciones y\r\ndescubr\xc3\xacmientos en Patagonia, Buenos Ayres, 1880) in proof that the\r\nlanguage of the Patagonians has undergone but slight change since the\r\ntime of Pigafetta. See also lists of words in Brinton (ut supra), p.\r\n364, from the Patagonian and Fuegian languages. The vocabularies given\r\nby Horatio Hale (Wilkes\xe2\x80\x99s U. S. Exploring Expedition, 1838\xe2\x80\x931842,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1846, viii, pp. 651\xe2\x80\x93656) bear no resemblance to\r\nPigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary. Hale says that guttural sounds are frequent\r\namong the Indians of the Patagonian district.\r\n\r\n[162] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9ccapae.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[163] Cf. with the methods of fire-making used by the North American\r\nIndians in Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents (Cleveland reissue);\r\nsee also Captivity of Hans Stade (Hakluyt Society edition), p. 126.\r\n\r\nAt this point (folio 14a) in the original Italian MS. occurs the first\r\nchart, representing the straits of Magellan (see p. 86). The cardinal\r\npoints in all of Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s charts are the reverse of the ordinary,\r\nthe north being below and the south above. MS. 5,650 precedes this\r\nchart (which there occupies folio 21a) by the words: \xe2\x80\x9cBelow is\r\ndepicted the strait of Patagonie.\xe2\x80\x9d Immediately following this chart\r\nin the Italian MS. (folio 15a) is the chart of the Ysole Infortunate\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate Isles;\xe2\x80\x9d see p. 92). These islands are shown in MS.\r\n5,650 on folio 23a, with the following notice: \xe2\x80\x9cHere are shown the\r\ntwo islands called \xe2\x80\x98Unfortunate Islands.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The charts in the\r\nItalian MS. are brown or dull black on a blue ground.\r\n\r\n[164] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 9) says that Magalh\xc3\xa3es left the\r\nstrait November 26 (having entered it October 21); the anonymous\r\nPortuguese (Stanley, p. 31) and Peter Martyr (Mosto, p. 65, note 1),\r\nNovember 27.\r\n\r\n[165] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we ate only biscuits that had fallen to\r\npowder, which was quite full of worms, and stank from the filth of the\r\nurine of rats that covered it, and of which the good had been eaten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEden (p. 252) reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd hauynge in this tyme con\xc5\xbfumed all theyr\r\nby\xc5\xbfket and other vyttales, they fell into \xc5\xbfuche nece\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfitie that\r\nthey were inforced to eate the pouder that remayned therof beinge nowe\r\nfull of woormes and \xc5\xbftynkynge lyke py\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfe by rea\xc5\xbfon of the \xc5\xbfalte\r\nwater,\xe2\x80\x9d Herrera (Navarrete, iv, p. 51) says that the rice was cooked\r\nwith salt water.\r\n\r\n[166] A curious coincidence in view of Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Esteban\r\nGomez at a council called in the strait to discuss the continuance of\r\nthe voyage that \xe2\x80\x9calthough he had to eat the cowhide wrappings of the\r\nyardarms, he would still persevere and discover what he had promised\r\nthe emperor\xe2\x80\x9d (Navarrete, iv, p. 43; cited from Herrera). At that\r\ncouncil Andr\xc3\xa9 de San Martin, pilot in the \xe2\x80\x9cSan Antonio,\xe2\x80\x9d advised\r\nthat they continue explorations until the middle of January, 1521, and\r\nthen return to Spain; and urged that no farther southward descent be\r\nmade, and that navigation along so dangerous coasts be only by day, in\r\norder that the crew might have some rest (Navarrete, iv, pp. 45\xe2\x80\x9349).\r\n\r\n[167] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cenough of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[168] This was the scurvy. Navarrete (iv, p. 54) following a document\r\nconserved in Archivo general de Indias, says that only eleven men died\r\nof scurvy during the voyage from the strait to the Ladrones.\r\n\r\n[169] The anonymous Portuguese says (Stanley, p. 31) that after sailing\r\nwest and northwest for 9,858 miles, the equator was reached. At the\r\nline (\xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro,\xe2\x80\x9d Stanley, p. 9), Magalh\xc3\xa3es changed the course in\r\norder to strike land north of the Moluccas, as \xe2\x80\x9che had information\r\nthat there were no provisions\xe2\x80\x9d there.\r\n\r\n[170] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is well named Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[171] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is a large fish called tiburoni.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nanonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31), says that the Unfortunate\r\nIslands were met before the line was reached and were eight hundred\r\nmiles distant from one another. One was called St. Peter (in 18\xc2\xb0) and\r\nthe other the island of Tiburones (in 14\xc2\xb0). Transylvanus (Vol. I, p.\r\n321), Herrera, and Oviedo, say that the three vessels stopped two days\r\nat those islands for supplies, but Albo\xe2\x80\x99s journal (Navarrete, iv, p.\r\n218) indicates that no stop was made there. The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley,\r\np. 9), gives the latitude of these islands as 18\xc2\xb0 or 19\xc2\xb0 and 13\xc2\xb0 or\r\n14\xc2\xb0. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 218) says that the first was discovered\r\nJanuary 24 in 16\xc2\xb0 15\xc2\xb4, and was called San Pablo, because that was the\r\ndate of St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s conversion; and the island of Tiburones was\r\ndiscovered February 4, in 10\xc2\xb0 40\xc2\xb4, at a distance of 9\xc2\xb0 (sic) from\r\nthe former. Eden (p. 253) says that the second island lay in 5\xc2\xb0. These\r\ntwo islands were probably Puka-puka (the Honden Eyland of the Dutch\r\natlases) of the Tuamotu group, located in latitude 14\xc2\xb0 45\xc2\xb4 south, and\r\nlongitude 138\xc2\xb0 48\xc2\xb4 west; and Flint Island of the Manihiki group,\r\nlocated in latitude 11\xc2\xb0 20\xc2\xb4 south and longitude 151\xc2\xb0 48\xc2\xb4 west. The\r\nlatter is still uninhabited, but the former contains a population of\r\nover four hundred. See ante, note 163. See Guillemard, p. 220, and\r\nMosto, p. 65, note 6.\r\n\r\n[172] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cnow at the stern, now at the windward side,\r\nor otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d Amoretti changes this passage completely, reading:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to our measurement of the distance that we made with the\r\nchain astern, we ran from sixty to seventy leagues daily.\xe2\x80\x9d Many\r\nbasing themselves on this passage of Amoretti, have believed that the\r\nlog was in use at the time of the first circumnavigation. Dr. Breusing\r\n(Die Catena a poppa bei Pigafetta und die Logge, in \xe2\x80\x9cZeitschrift der\r\nGesellschaft f\xc3\xbcr Erdkunde zu Berlin,\xe2\x80\x9d 1869, iv, pp. 107\xe2\x80\x93115)\r\nbelieves that the \xe2\x80\x9cstern chain (catena poppa) is not the log properly\r\nso-called, but an instrument for determining the angle of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleeway, an opinion accepted also by Gelcich in his La scoperta\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99America e Cristoforo Colombo nella letteratura moderna (Gorizia,\r\n1890). L\xe2\x80\x99Vzielle (Studi bibliogr. e biogr. sulla storia della geogr.\r\nin Italia, Roma, 1875, part ii, introduction, pp. 294\xe2\x80\x93296), combats\r\nthat opinion, as well as the idea that the log is meant. The difficulty\r\nof the passage, he says, hinges on the word ho and whether it is\r\ninterpreted as a verb or a conjunction. If it be a conjunction then the\r\npassage, means \xe2\x80\x9cestimating by sight, the rate of the ship from the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98bow catena,\xe2\x80\x99 or at the stern\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x98catena\xe2\x80\x99 being a beam\r\nperpendicular to the ship\xe2\x80\x99s axis at the point near the bow where it\r\nbegins to curve inward; that is, at such a point that from that place\r\nto the stern, the direction of the apparent way is parallel to the\r\nlongitudinal axis of the ship) his ship made fifty, sixty, or seventy\r\nleagues.\xe2\x80\x9d One might suppose, if ho be regarded as a verb, that\r\nPigafetta called catena a cross beam of the stern (the passage reading\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe catena that was at the stern\xe2\x80\x9d); or that the disjunctive ho,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d is used in place of e, \xe2\x80\x9cand,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Pigafetta, dividing\r\nthe distance between the stern and the bow catena by the time necessary\r\nfor a fixed point of the sea to pass from the elevation of the bow to\r\nthat of the stern, thus deduced the ship\xe2\x80\x99s rate. See Mosto, p. 66,\r\nnote 1. L\xe2\x80\x99Vzielli\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is the most probable, for although the\r\nlog is mentioned by Purchas as early as 1607, its use did not become\r\ngeneral until 1620. An instrument used to measure the rates of vessels\r\nis mentioned as early as 1577, but it was very deficient.\r\n\r\n[173] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 6) says that this cape, which he\r\ncalls \xe2\x80\x9ccape of the virgins\xe2\x80\x9d was discovered on October 21, 1520, and\r\nlay in latitude about 52\xc2\xb0 south. Barros says that it was discovered on\r\nOctober 20; and Transylvanus and Oviedo, on November 27. See Mosto, p.\r\n61, note 1.\r\n\r\n[174] Regarding the reckonings Eden says: \xe2\x80\x9cIn \xc5\xbfo much that it was\r\nnece\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfarie to helpe the needle with the lode \xc5\xbftone (commonly cauled\r\nthe adamant) before they could \xc5\xbfaile therwith, bycau\xc5\xbfe it moued not\r\nas it doothe when it is in the\xc5\xbfe owre partes.\xe2\x80\x9d Eden also gives a cut\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc5\xbftarres abowt the pole Antartike.\xe2\x80\x9d The same author also\r\n(pp. 277\xe2\x80\x93280) compiles from Amerigo Vespucci and Andreas de Corsali a\r\ntreatise entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOf the Pole Antartike and the stars abowt the same\r\nand of the qualitie of the regions and disposition of the Elementes\r\nabowt the Equinoctiall line. Al\xc5\xbfo certeyne \xc5\xbfecreates touching the\r\narte of \xc5\xbfaylynge.\xe2\x80\x9d The former says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe pole Antartike hath\r\nnother the great beare nor the lyttle as is \xc5\xbfeene abowte owre pole.\r\nBut hath foure \xc5\xbftarres whiche compa\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfe it abowt in forme of a\r\nquadrangle.

The\r\nMagellanic clouds resemble portions of the milky way, Nubecula major\r\nbeing visible to the naked eye in strong moonlight and covering about\r\ntwo hundred times the moon\xe2\x80\x99s surface, while the Nubecula minor,\r\nalthough visible to the naked eye, disappears in full moonlight, and\r\ncovers an area only one-fourth that of the former. They were first\r\nobserved by the Arabians. The Portuguese pilots probably called them at\r\nfirst \xe2\x80\x9cclouds of the cape.\xe2\x80\x9d (Mosto, p. 66, note 2). The Southern\r\nCross, which resembles a lute rather than a cross, was first erected\r\ninto a constellation by Royer in 1679, although often spoken of before\r\nas a cross. Only one of its five principal stars belongs to the first\r\nmagnitude. The cross is only 6\xc2\xb0 in extent north and south and less\r\nthan that east and west.\r\n\r\nThe second chart of the plate at p. 92 represents the Ladrones Islands\r\nand occurs in the Italian MS. at this point (folio 16b). This chart is\r\nfound on folio 25b in MS. 5,650, and is preceded by the inscription:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe island of the robbers and the style of their boats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[175] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cDuring that time of two months and twelve\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[176] Amoretti reads: \xe2\x80\x9cthree degrees east of Capo Verde.\xe2\x80\x9d If the\r\ncape is meant, the correction is proper, but if the islands, the MS. is\r\ncorrect. See Mosto, p. 67, note 4.\r\n\r\n[177] Cipangu is Japan, while Sumbdit Pradit may be the island of\r\nAntilia, called \xe2\x80\x9cSepte citade\xe2\x80\x9d on Martin Behaim\xe2\x80\x99s globe (Mosto,\r\np. 67, note 5). The locations given by Pigafetta prove that they did\r\nnot see them, but that he writes only from vague reports. Europe first\r\nlearned of Japan, near the end of the thirteenth century, through Marco\r\nPolo, who had been told in China fabulous tales of the wealth of\r\nZipangu. This word is derived by Marco Polo from the Chinese\r\nDschi-pen-Ku\xc3\xab or Dschi-pon, which the Japanese have transformed into\r\nNippon or Nihon. See Travels of Marco Polo, book iii, ch. ii; and\r\nRein\xe2\x80\x99s Japan, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[178] See Vol. I, pp. 208, 209, 210, 312, 336.\r\n\r\n[179] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9csixty.\xe2\x80\x9d Transylvanus (Vol. I, p. 322) names\r\ntwo islands of the Ladrones Inuagana and Acacan, but says that both\r\nwere uninhabited. Guillemard (ut supra, p. 223) conjectures these names\r\nto be identical with Agana in Guam and Sosan in Rota. Hugues (Mosto, p.\r\n67, note 7) believes the first island visited to have been Guam, and\r\nhis conjecture is undoubtedly correct.\r\n\r\n[180] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9ccalled skiff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[181] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cof the said island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[182] MS. 5,650 has a new unnumbered chapter heading before the\r\nfollowing paragraph.\r\n\r\n[183] This phrase is omitted in MS. 5,650, as is also all the following\r\nsentence; but that MS. adds: \xe2\x80\x9cWe left the said island immediately\r\nafterward, and continued our course.\xe2\x80\x9d This was on March 9, on which\r\nday the only Englishman in the fleet, \xe2\x80\x9cMaster Andrew\xe2\x80\x9d of Bristol,\r\ndied (Guillemard, ut supra, p. 226).\r\n\r\n[184] Eden (p. 254) says: \xe2\x80\x9ctwo hundreth of theyr boates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[185] MS. 5,650 has a new chapter at this point, although the chapter\r\nis unnumbered.\r\n\r\nWhen Loaisa\xe2\x80\x99s expedition reached the Ladrones, they found still alive\r\na Galician, one of three deserters from Espinosa\xe2\x80\x99s ship (see Vol. II,\r\npp. 30, 34, 35, 110). See the reception accorded Legazpi, and a\r\ndescription of one of those islands in 1565, Vol. II, pp. 109\xe2\x80\x93113.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 9) says that the expedition reached the\r\nLadrones, March 6, 1521 (with which Albo, Navarrete, iv, p. 219\r\nagrees); and that after the theft of the skiff, Magellan landed with\r\nfifty or sixty men, burned the whole village, killed seven or eight\r\npersons, both men and women; and that supplies were taken aboard. The\r\nanonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that the Ladrones (which lay\r\nin 10\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x9312\xc2\xb0 north latitude, were 2,046 miles by the course traveled\r\nfrom the equator. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) says: \xe2\x80\x9cThence [i.e.,\r\nthe Unfortunate Islands] they laid their course westward, and after\r\nsailing 500 leguas came to certain islands where they found a\r\nconsiderable number of savages. So many of the latter boarded the\r\nvessels that when the men tried to restore order in them, they were\r\nunable to get rid of the savages except by lance-thrusts. They killed\r\nmany savages, who laughed as if it were a cause for rejoicing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[186] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cor superior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[187] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9ccloth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[188] At this point, MS. 5,650 begins a new sentence, thus: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare found in that place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[189] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThose women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[190] MS. 5,650 makes use of the Italian word store for stuoje or stoje\r\nmeaning \xe2\x80\x9cmats,\xe2\x80\x9d and explains by adding: \xe2\x80\x9cwhich we call mats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[191] They also (according to Herrera) received the name Las Velas,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe sails\xe2\x80\x9d from the lateen-rigged vessels that the natives used\r\n(Mosto, p. 67, note 7). See also Vol. XVI, pp. 200\xe2\x80\x93202.\r\n\r\n[192] In MS. 5,650 this sentence reads as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThe pastime of\r\nthe men and women of the said place and their sport, is to go in their\r\nboats to catch those flying fish with fishhooks made of fishbone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[193] Mosto (p. 68, note 5) says that these boats were the fisolere,\r\nwhich were small and very swift oared-vessels, used in winter on the\r\nVenetian lakes by the Venetian nobles for hunting with bows and arrows\r\nand guns. Amoretti conjectures that Pigafetta means the fusiniere,\r\nboats named after Fusine whence people are ferried to Venice.\r\n\r\n[194] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe said boats have no difference between\r\nstern and bow.\xe2\x80\x9d Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 219), in speaking of the\r\nboats of the Chamorros, uses almost identically the same expression:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey went both ways, for they could make the stern, bow, and the\r\nbow, stern, whenever they wished.\xe2\x80\x9d The apparatus described by\r\nPigafetta as belonging to these boats is the outrigger, common to many\r\nof the boats of the eastern islands.\r\n\r\n[195] In the Italian MS., the chart of Aguada ly boni segnaly\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cWatering-place of good signs\xe2\x80\x9d), Zzamal (Samar), Abarien, Humunu,\r\nHyunagan, Zuluam, Cenalo, and Ybusson (q.v., p. 102) follows at this\r\npoint. It is found on folio 29b of MS. 5,650 and is preceded by the\r\nfollowing: \xe2\x80\x9cHere is shown the island of Good Signs, and the four\r\nislands, Cenalo, Humanghar, Ibusson, and Abarien, and several\r\nothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[196] \xe2\x80\x9cThe tenth of March\xe2\x80\x9d in Eden, and the distance of Zamal from\r\nthe Ladrones is given as \xe2\x80\x9cxxx. leagues.\xe2\x80\x9d Albo (Navarrete, iv, p.\r\n220) says that the first land seen was called Yunagan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nextended north and had many bays;\xe2\x80\x9d and that going south from there\r\nthey anchored at a small island called Suluan. At the former \xe2\x80\x9cwe saw\r\nsome canoes, and went thither, but they fled. That island lies in 9\xc2\xb0\r\n40\xc2\xb4 north latitude.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 10) says that\r\nthe first land seen was in \xe2\x80\x9cbarely eleven degrees,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the\r\nfleet \xe2\x80\x9cwent to touch at another further on, which appeared first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTwo praus approached a boat sent ashore, whereupon the latter was\r\nordered back, and the praus fled. Thereupon the fleet went to another\r\nnearby island \xe2\x80\x9cwhich lies in ten degrees, to which they gave the name\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x98Island of Good Signs,\xe2\x80\x99 because they found some gold in\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[197] This word is omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[198] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cmore than one foot long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[199] Since rice is an important staple among all the eastern islands,\r\nit is natural that there are different and distinctive names for that\r\ngrain in the various languages and dialects for all stages of its\r\ngrowth and all its modes of preparation. Thus the Tag\xc3\xa1log has words\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cgreen rice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crice with small heads,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdirty and partly\r\nrotten rice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cearly rice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clate rice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccooked rice,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand many others. See also U. S. Philippine Gazetteer, pp. 70, 71.\r\n\r\n[200] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to explain what manner of fruit is\r\nthat above named, one must know that what is called \xe2\x80\x98cochi\xe2\x80\x99 is the\r\nfruit borne by the palm-tree. Just as we have bread, wine, oil, and\r\nvinegar, which are obtained from different things, so those people get\r\nthe above named substances from those palm-trees alone.\xe2\x80\x9d See\r\nDelgado\xe2\x80\x99s Historia, pp. 634\xe2\x80\x93659, for description of the useful\r\ncocoa palm; also, U.

It is a\r\nsmall island southeast of Samar. See ante, note 196. Dr. David P.\r\nBarrows (Census of the Philippines, Washington, 1905, i, p. 413), says\r\nthat the men from Suluan \xe2\x80\x9cwere perhaps not typical of the rest of the\r\npopulation which Magellan found sparsely scattered about the coasts of\r\nthe central islands, but ... were almost certainly of the same stock\r\nfrom which the present Visayan people are in the main descended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese natives had probably come, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cin successively extending\r\nsettlements, up the west coast of Mindanao from the Sulu archipelago.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sul\xc3\xbaan\xe2\x80\x99 itself means \xe2\x80\x98Where there are Suluges,\xe2\x80\x99 that is, men\r\nof Sulu or Jol\xc3\xb3.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[205] MS. adds: \xe2\x80\x9cseeing that they were thus well dispositioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[206] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cinto the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[207] Albo calls it (Navarrete, iv, p. 220) the island of Gada (i.e.,\r\nAguada, \xe2\x80\x9cwatering-place\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cwhere we took on water and wood, that\r\nisland being very free of shoals\xe2\x80\x9d (see ante, note 196). This island\r\nis now called Homonh\xc3\xb3n, Jomonjol, or Malh\xc3\xb3n. Its greatest dimensions\r\nare ten miles from northwest to southeast, and five miles from\r\nnortheast to southwest. It is eleven miles southwest from the nearest\r\npoint in Samar. It is called \xe2\x80\x9cBuenas Se\xc3\xb1as\xe2\x80\x9d on Murillo Velarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmap.\r\n\r\n[208] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley p. 11) says that the archipelago was\r\nalso called \xe2\x80\x9cVall Sem Periguo,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cValley without Peril.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nname \xe2\x80\x9cFilipinas\xe2\x80\x9d was not applied to them until 1542 by Villalobos\r\n(see Vol. II, p. 48).\r\n\r\n[209] Probably the jungle-fowl (Gallus bankiva) which is caught and\r\ntamed in large numbers by the natives of the Philippines and still used\r\nfor crossing with the domestic fowl. See Guillemard (ut supra, p. 228,\r\nnote 1).\r\n\r\n[210] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[211] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cIn his ears he wore pendants of gold jewels,\r\nwhich they call \xe2\x80\x98schione.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[212] MS. adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwhom he had put ashore on that island that they\r\nmight recruit their strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[213] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is another island near the above\r\nisland, inhabited by people.\xe2\x80\x9d Mosto says (p. 70, note 6) that picheti\r\nis from the Spanish piquete, \xe2\x80\x9ca small hole made with a sharp pointed\r\ninstrument.\xe2\x80\x9d This custom of piercing the ears is quite general among\r\nsavage, barbarous, and semi-barbarous peoples.\r\n\r\n[214] Eden (p. 254) reads: \xe2\x80\x9ccaphranita that is gentyles.\xe2\x80\x9d See Vol.\r\nIII, p. 93, note 29.\r\n\r\n[215] This word is omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[216] Our transcript reads facine, and MS. 5,650 fascine, both of which\r\ntranslate \xe2\x80\x9cfascines.\xe2\x80\x9d Mosto reads focine, which is amended by\r\nAmoretti to foscine. This latter is probably the same word as fiocina,\r\na \xe2\x80\x9charpoon\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ceel-spear,\xe2\x80\x9d and hence here a \xe2\x80\x9cdart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[217] Stanley failed to decipher this word in MS. 5,650, which is the\r\nsame as the word in the Italian MS. Mosto, citing Boerio (Dizion.\r\nveneziano), says of rizali: \xe2\x80\x9cRizzagio or rizzagno, \xe2\x80\x98sweepnet\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nfine thickly woven net, which when thrown into rivers by the fisherman,\r\nopens, and when near the bottom, closes, and covers and encloses the\r\nfish. Rizzagio is also called that contrivance or net, made in the\r\nmanner of an inverted cone, with a barrel hoop attached to the\r\ncircumference as a selvage. It has a hole underneath, through which if\r\nthe eels in the ponds slyly enter the net, there is no danger of their\r\nescape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFish are caught in the Philippines by various devices\xe2\x80\x94in favorable\r\nsituations by traps, weirs, corrals of bamboo set along the shore in\r\nshallow waters. Various kinds of nets and seines, the hook and line,\r\nand also the spear, are also used. See Census of the Philippine Islands\r\n(Washington, 1905), iv, p. 533.\r\n\r\n[218] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cHiunanghar.\xe2\x80\x9d Stanley has mistranscribed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuinanghar.\xe2\x80\x9d It is difficult to identify the four islands of\r\nCenalo, Hiunanghan, Ibusson, and Abarien with certainty. Mosto (p. 71,\r\nnotes) suggests that they may be Dinagat, Cabugan, Gibuson, and\r\nCabalari\xc3\xa1n. The first three are evidently correct, as those islands\r\nwould naturally be sighted in the course followed. The last island is\r\nshown in Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s chart to be north of Malh\xc3\xb3n, and the\r\nprobability is that he names and locates it merely from hearsay, and\r\nthat they did not see it. Its position seems to indicate Manicani\r\nrather than Cabalari\xc3\xa1n.\r\n\r\nAfter this paragraph in the Italian MS. (folio 21a) follows the chart\r\nof the islands of Pozzon, Ticobon, Polon, Baibai and Ceilon (together\r\nforming the island of Leyte), Gatighan, Bohol, and Mazzana (sic) (q.v.,\r\np. 112). This chart in MS. 5,650 (on folio 36a) is preceded by:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelow is shown the cape of Gatighan and many other islands\r\nsurrounding it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[219] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 220) says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe departed thence [i.e.,\r\nfrom Malh\xc3\xb3n] and went toward the west in order to strike a large\r\nisland called Seilani [i.e., Leyte] which is inhabited and has gold in\r\nit. We coasted along it and took our course to the west southwest in\r\norder to strike a small island, which is inhabited and called Mazava.\r\nThe people there are very friendly. We erected a cross on a mountain in\r\nthat island. Three islands lying to the west southwest were pointed out\r\nto us from that island, which are said to possess gold in abundance.\r\nThey showed us how it was obtained. They found pieces as large as\r\nchickpeas and beans. Masava lies in latitude 9 and two-thirds degrees\r\nnorth.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 11) says: \xe2\x80\x9cThey ran on to\r\nanother island twenty leagues from that from which they sailed [i.e.,\r\nMalh\xc3\xb3n], and came to anchor at another island, which is named Macangor\r\n[i.e., Masaua], which is nine degrees; and in this island they were\r\nvery well received, and they placed a cross in it.\xe2\x80\x9d See also Vol. I,\r\npp. 322, 323.\r\n\r\n[220] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cBut they moved off immediately and would not\r\nenter the ship through distrust of us.\xe2\x80\x9d The slave who acted as\r\ninterpreter is the Henrique de Malaca of Navarrete\xe2\x80\x99s list.\r\n\r\n[221] Bara: the Spanish word barra.\r\n\r\n[222] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cto ask him to give him some food for his\r\nships in exchange for his money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[223] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe king hearing that came with seven or\r\neight men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[224] For dorade, i.e., the dorado.

Casicasi means \xe2\x80\x9cintimate\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d See Trumbull\xe2\x80\x99s Blood Covenant (Philadelphia, 1898), which\r\nshows how widespread was the covenant or friendship typified by blood.\r\n\r\n[226] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that the said captain had one of his\r\nmen-at-arms armed in offensive armor.\xe2\x80\x9d Stanley has translated harnois\r\nblanc literally as \xe2\x80\x9cwhite armor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[227] This passage may be translated: \xe2\x80\x9cThereby was the king rendered\r\nalmost speechless, and told the captain, through the slave, that one of\r\nthose armed men was worth a hundred of his own men. The captain\r\nanswered that that was a fact, and that he had brought two hundred men\r\nin each ship, who were armed in that manner.\xe2\x80\x9d Eden so understood it,\r\nand reads: \xe2\x80\x9cwhereat the Kynge marualed greatly, and \xc5\xbfayde to th[e]\r\ninterpretoure (who was a \xc5\xbflaue borne in Malacha) that one of tho\xc5\xbfe\r\narmed men was able to encounter with a hundreth of his men.\xe2\x80\x9d MS.\r\n5,650 agrees with the translation of the text.\r\n\r\n[228] Instead of this last phrase MS. 5,650 has: \xe2\x80\x9cand he made two of\r\nhis men engage in sword-play before the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[229] MS. 5,650 says only: \xe2\x80\x9cThen he showed the king the sea-chart,\r\nand the navigation compass.\xe2\x80\x9d Eden says (p. 348) that the first to use\r\nthe compass was one \xe2\x80\x9cFlauius of Malpha, a citie in the kingdom of\r\nNaples....

The compass was known in a rough form to the Chinese at early as\r\n2634 B.C., and first applied to navigation in the third or fourth\r\ncentury A.D., or perhaps earlier. It was probably introduced into\r\nEurope through the Arabs who learned of it from the Chinese. It is\r\nfirst referred to in European literature by Alexander Neckam in the\r\ntwelfth century in De Utensilibus. The variations from the true north\r\nwere observed as early as 1269.\r\n\r\n[230] Stanley says that the Amoretti edition represents the king as\r\nmaking this request and Magalh\xc3\xa3es as assenting thereto; but the\r\nItalian MS. reads as distinctly as MS. 5,650, that Magalh\xc3\xa3es made the\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n[231] MS. 5,650 omits the remainder of this sentence.\r\n\r\n[232] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, a boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[233] The following passage relating to the meal reads thus in MS.\r\n5,650: \xe2\x80\x9cThen the king had a plate of pork and some wine brought in.\r\nTheir fashion of drinking is as follows. First they lift their hands\r\ntoward the sky, and then take with the right hand the vessel from which\r\nthey drink, while extending the fist of the left hand toward the\r\npeople. The king did that to me, and extended his fist toward me, so\r\nthat I thought that he was going to strike me. But I did the same to\r\nhim, and in such wise did we banquet and afterwards sup with him using\r\nthat ceremony and others.\xe2\x80\x9d See Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s Ceremonial Institutions,\r\nespecially chapter I.\r\n\r\n[234] Eden reads (p. 255): \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the kynge \xc5\xbfawe Antonie Pigafetta\r\nwrite the names of many thinges, and afterwarde rehear\xc5\xbfe them ageyne,\r\nhe marualed yet more, makynge \xc5\xbfygnes that \xc5\xbfuche men de\xc5\xbfcended from\r\nheauen.\xe2\x80\x9d Continuing he confuses the eldest son of the first king with\r\nthe latter\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the second king.\r\n\r\n[235] A tolerably good description of the native houses of the present\r\nday in the Philippines.

The passage there reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\r\ndishes with which he is served, and also a part of his house, which was\r\nwell furnished according to the custom of the country, were of gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[238] MS. 5,650 omits this sentence.\r\n\r\n[239] Butuan and Caraga in the northeastern part of Mindanao.\r\n\r\n[240] This name is variously rendered: Mosto, Siain; MS. 5,650, Siaui;\r\nStanley, Siani; and Amoretti and Eden, Siagu.\r\n\r\n[241] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cthe captain sent the chaplain ashore to\r\ncelebrate mass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[242] MS. 5,650 says that they took only their swords; but the Italian\r\nMS. says distinctly that a signal was given to the ships from the shore\r\nby means of muskets, and again that the musketry was fired when the\r\nkings and Magalh\xc3\xa3es separated, both of which references are omitted by\r\nMS. 5,650. Eden reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Captaine came alande with fyftie of his\r\nmen in theyr be\xc5\xbft apparel withowte weapons or harne\xc5\xbf\xc5\xbfe, and all the\r\nre\xc5\xbfydue well armed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[243] In Eden (p. 255): \xe2\x80\x9cdama\xc5\xbfke water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[244] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cbut they offered nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[245] MS. 5,650 says: \xe2\x80\x9cevery one did his duties as a Christian and\r\nreceived our Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[246] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cfor the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[247] The Italian MS. reads literally and somewhat ambiguously: \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nmade immediate reverence;\xe2\x80\x9d MS. 5,650 says \xe2\x80\x9cto which these kings\r\nmade reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d which is scarcely likely, as the latter would, until\r\ntold by Magalh\xc3\xa3es, see nothing in the ceremony. Rather it was the\r\nSpaniards who made the reverence.\r\n\r\n[248] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever any ships came from Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[249] Cf. Morga, Vol. XVI, p. 132.\r\n\r\n[250] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cmen and ships to render them obedient to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[251] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cto the middle of the highest mountain,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nevidently confusing mezo di (\xe2\x80\x9cafternoon\xe2\x80\x9d) of the Italian MS. with\r\nmezo (mezzo; \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle\xe2\x80\x9d); for the cross was set up on the summit of\r\nthe mountain. The passage in MS. 5,650 continues: \xe2\x80\x9cThen those two\r\nkings and the captain rested, and while conversing, the latter had them\r\nasked [not \xe2\x80\x9cI had them asked\xe2\x80\x9d as in Stanley, who mistranscribes jl\r\n(il) as je] where the best port was for getting food. They replied that\r\nthere were three, namely, Ceylom, Zzubu, and Galaghan, but that Zzeubu\r\nwas the largest and the best trading place.\xe2\x80\x9d These are the islands of\r\nLeyte (the Seilani of Albo, Navarrete, iv, p. 20; and the Selani of\r\nTransylvanus, Vol. I, p. 322), Ceb\xc3\xba, and Mindanao (the Caraga\r\ndistrict).\r\n\r\n[252] 5,650 reads simply: \xe2\x80\x9cThen we descended to the place where their\r\nboats were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[253] This account is very much shortened in MS. 5,650, where it reads\r\nas follows: \xe2\x80\x9cAs the captain intended to leave next morning, he asked\r\nthe king for pilots in order that they might conduct him to the ports\r\nabovesaid. He promised the king to treat those pilots as he would them\r\nthemselves, and that he would leave one of his men as a hostage. In\r\nreply the first king said that he would go himself to guide the captain\r\nto those ports and that he would be his pilot, but asked him to wait\r\ntwo days until he should gather his rice, and do some other things\r\nwhich he had to do. He asked the captain to lend him some of his men,\r\nso that he could accomplish it sooner, and the captain agreed to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAt this point MS. 5,650 begins a new unnumbered chapter.\r\n\r\n[254] The billon and afterward copper coin quattrino, which was struck\r\nin the mints of Venice, Rome, Florence, Reggio, the Two Sicilies, etc.\r\nThe quattrino of the popes was often distinguished as \xe2\x80\x9cquattrino\r\nRomano.\xe2\x80\x9d The Venetian copper quattrino was first struck in the reign\r\nof Francesco Foscari (1423\xe2\x80\x9357).

See chart of these islands on p. 112.\r\n\r\nAlbo (Navarrete, iv, pp. 220, 221) says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe left Mazava and went\r\nnorth toward the island of Seilani, after which we ran along the said\r\nisland to the northwest as far as 10 degrees. There we saw three rocky\r\nislands, and turned our course west for about 10 leguas where we came\r\nupon two islets. We stayed there that night and in the morning went\r\ntoward the south southwest for about 12 leguas, as far as 10 and\r\none-third degrees. At that point we entered a channel between two\r\nislands, one of which is called Matan and the other Subu. Subu, as well\r\nas the islands of Mazava and Suluan extend north by east and south by\r\nwest. Between Subu and Seilani we spied a very lofty land lying to the\r\nnorth, which is called Baibai. It is said to contain considerable gold\r\nand to be well stocked with food, and so great an extent of land that\r\nits limits are unknown. From Mazava, Seilani, and Subu, on the course\r\nfollowed toward the south, look out for the many shoals, which are very\r\nbad. On that account a canoe which was guiding us along that course,\r\nrefused to go ahead. From the beginning of the channel of Subu and\r\nMatan, we turned west by a middle channel and reached the city of Subu.\r\nThere we anchored and made peace, and the people there gave us rice,\r\nmillet, and meat. We stayed there for a considerable time. The king and\r\nqueen of that place and many of the inhabitants readily became\r\nChristians.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 11) says that the king of\r\nMacangar (i.e., Mazaua) conducted the Spaniards \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of thirty\r\nleagues to another island named Cabo [i.e., Ceb\xc3\xba], which is in ten\r\ndegrees, and in this island Fernando de Magalh\xc3\xa3es did what he pleased\r\nwith the consent of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d Brito says merely (Navarrete, iv,\r\np. 308): \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, after passing amid many islands, they reached\r\none called Mazaba, which lies in 9 degrees. The king of Mazaba\r\nconducted them to another large island called Zub\xc3\xb3.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[266] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9conly one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d Barbastili is a Venetian\r\nword for pipistrelli. These bats are the Pteropi or \xe2\x80\x9cflying foxes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe large fruit-eating bats of which so many species inhabit the Malay\r\nArchipelago.

See Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s chart showing these\r\nislands on p. 112.\r\n\r\n[269] Following this point in the Italian MS. (folio 26a) is the chart\r\nof the islands of Bohol, Mattam, and Zzubu (q.v., p. 136).\r\n\r\nMS. 5,650 presents this chart on folio 51a, preceded by the words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelow are shown the islands of Zzubu, Mattan, and Boh\xc3\xb3l.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[270] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cBut the interpreter reassured them by telling\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[271] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cand he was going, by the orders of the said\r\nsovereign, to discover the islands of Mallucque.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[272] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThereupon the abovesaid merchant said to the\r\nking in their language,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., without giving the original Malay\r\nwords. Eden gives the phrase as catacaia chita.\r\n\r\n[273] Calicut, properly K\xc3\xa1l\xc3\xadkot (said to be derived from two words\r\nmeaning cock-crow, because the territory granted to the first king of\r\nK\xc3\xa1l\xc3\xadkot was limited to the extent over which a cock could be heard to\r\ncrow; or from K\xc3\xa1li, one of the names of the goddess Gauri) is the name\r\nof a district and city on the Malabar coast. The king of all the\r\nMalabar coast from Goa to Cape Comorin, Samari Perymal, having adopted\r\nthe Mahometan faith divided his kingdom into the kingdoms of Calicut,\r\nCochin, Cananor, and Coul\xc3\xa3o, and gave them to his friends, on\r\ncondition that the king of Calicut be termed \xe2\x80\x9cZamorim\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSamorim,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cSupreme emperor and God upon earth\xe2\x80\x9d (although\r\nthe proper form is said to be \xe2\x80\x9cTamurin\xe2\x80\x9d which is conjectured by\r\nsome to be a modification of the Sanskrit \xe2\x80\x9cSamunri,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cseaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe city of K\xc3\xa1l\xc3\xadkot, a noted emporium of trade, was built perhaps as\r\nearly as 805 A.D., although the date 1300 A.D. is also given as that of\r\nits founding; and is described by Ibn Batuta in 1342 as one of the\r\nfinest ports in the world. It was visited by Covilham in 1486, and\r\nVasco da Gama\xe2\x80\x99s ships were freighted there in 1498. The latter\r\nattacked the city in 1503 and 1510, and the Portuguese built a\r\nfortified factory there in 1513 which was destroyed by the governor in\r\n1525 to avoid its falling into the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s hands. The English\r\nestablished a factory in the city in 1616, which was captured in 1766\r\nby Haidar Ali; but after a further series of capture and recapture, the\r\ncity and district was permanently turned over to the British (1792).\r\nSee Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s Vasco da Gama (Hakluyt Society publications, London,\r\n1869); Birch\xe2\x80\x99s Alboquerque (Hakluyt Society publications, London,\r\n1875\xe2\x80\x931884); Jones and Badger\xe2\x80\x99s Ludovico di Varthema (Hakluyt\r\nSociety publications, London, 1863), pp. 135\xe2\x80\x93177; also Grey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nTravels of Pietro della Valle (Hakluyt Society publications, London,\r\n1892), pp. 344, 345, note.\r\n\r\nMalacca, or more correctly M\xc3\xa2laka is the name of an ancient territory\r\nand city, which was probably first settled by Javanese, and is possibly\r\nderived from \xe2\x80\x9cMalayu\xe2\x80\x9d meaning in Javanese \xe2\x80\x9cto run\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfugitive.\xe2\x80\x9d At an early period Malacca fell under the sway of the\r\nSiamese. The city, located on both sides of the Malacca River, and only\r\none hundred and thirty miles northwest of Singapore (which has usurped\r\nthe great volume of trade once centering at Malacca) was founded about\r\n1250 A.D. The first European to visit the city was Varthema, about the\r\nyear 1505. It was captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511,\r\nand they held it (1580\xe2\x80\x931640 under Spanish control) until 1641 when it\r\nwas captured by the Dutch, who had unsuccessfully besieged it, with the\r\naid of the king of Jahor, in 1606. The English obtained possession of\r\nit in 1795, and still hold it, although the Dutch possessed it from\r\n1818\xe2\x80\x931825. For descriptions and history of Malacca, see the following\r\nHakluyt Society publications: Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s East Africa and Malabar\r\n(London, 1866), pp. 190\xe2\x80\x93195; Birch\xe2\x80\x99s Alboquerque, iii, pp. 71\xe2\x80\x9390\r\n(and other citations); Burnell and Tiele\xe2\x80\x99s Linschoten (London, 1885),\r\ni, pp. 104\xe2\x80\x93106; Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Voyage of Fran\xc3\xa7ois Pyrard (London, 1888),\r\npart i, p. ii.

Schiltbergen applied the\r\nterm Lesser India to the northern portion of the peninsula on this side\r\nof the Ganges, while the southern portion of the peninsula was termed\r\nGreater India. Marco Polo\xe2\x80\x99s Lesser India extended from Makran to and\r\nincluding the Coromandel coast, and his Greater India extended from the\r\nCoromandel coast to Cochin China, while Middle India was Abyssinia.\r\nMosto wrongly identifies India Major with the present Indian empire.\r\nSee Telfer\xe2\x80\x99s Johann Schiltberger (Hakluyt Society publications,\r\n1879). Friar Jordanus (Wonders of the East, Hakluyt Society edition,\r\nLondon, 1863), describes (pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9345) India the Less, India the\r\nGreater, and India Tertia. Yule points out that Jordanus\xe2\x80\x99s Lesser\r\nIndia embraces Sindh, and probably Mekran, and India along the coast as\r\nfar as some point immediately north of Malabar. Greater India extends\r\nfrom Malabar very indefinitely to the eastward, for he makes it include\r\nChampa. India Tertia is the east of Africa below Abyssinia.

Afterward he had us dance with them. Those girls were\r\nnaked except that they wore a garment made of the said palm-tree cloth\r\nbefore their privies and which hung from the waist to the knee,\r\nalthough some were quite naked. We were given refreshments there, and\r\nthen we returned to the ships.\xe2\x80\x9d These gongs are used in many parts of\r\nthe Orient.\r\n\r\n[296] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cby the captain\xe2\x80\x99s order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[297] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cwe told him of the death of our man, and that\r\nour captain requested that he might be buried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[298] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9caccording to our manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[299] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe king took it under his charge, and\r\npromised that no trickery or wrong would be done the king.

He told him that if he wished to\r\nbecome a good Christian (as he had signified on the preceding day),\r\nthat he must have all the idols of his country burned and set up a\r\ncross in their place, which they were all to adore daily on both knees,\r\nwith hands clasped and raised toward the heaven. The captain showed the\r\nking how he was to make the sign of the cross daily. In reply the king\r\nand all his men said that they would obey the captain\xe2\x80\x99s commandment,\r\nand do all that he told them. The captain took the king by the hand,\r\nand they walked to the platform. At his baptism the captain told the\r\nking that he would call him Dom Charles, after the emperor his\r\nsovereign. He named the prince Dom Fernand, after the brother of the\r\nsaid emperor, and the king of Mazzaua, Jehan. He gave the name of\r\nChristofle to the Moro, while he called each of the others by names\r\naccording to his fancy. Thus before the mass fifty men [sic: but an\r\nerror of the French adapter for five hundred] were baptized. At the\r\nconclusion of mass, the captain invited the king and the others of his\r\nchief men to dine with him, but he would not accept. However, he\r\naccompanied the captain to the shore, where, at his arrival, the ships\r\ndischarged all the artillery. Then embracing they took leave of one\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d Eden gives the number baptized as five hundred men.\r\n\r\n[313] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cOn seeing that, she expressed the greatest\r\ndesire to became a Christian, and asking for baptism, she was baptized\r\nand given the name of Jehanne, after the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[314] There are many cases of this wholesale baptism in the history of\r\nthe Catholic missions in various countries, and it cannot be condemned\r\nentirely and regarded as devoid of good effects, for many instances\r\nreveal the contrary. See Jesuit Relations (Cleveland reissue).\r\n\r\n[315] Those last six words are omitted in MS. 5,650. Mosto conjectures\r\nthat solana means solecchio or solicchio signifying an apparatus to\r\nprotect one from the sun. Pigafetta may have misapplied the Spanish\r\nword solana, which signifies a place bathed by the noontide sun or a\r\nplace in which to take the sun.\r\n\r\n[316] This last clause is omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[317] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand we gave it to her.\xe2\x80\x9d This was the image\r\nfound by one of Legazpi\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers in Ceb\xc3\xba in 1565 (see Vol. II, pp.\r\n120, 121, 128, 216, 217; and Vol. V, p. 41). Encarnaci\xc3\xb3n (Dic.\r\nbisaya-espa\xc3\xb1ol, Manila, 1851), says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cebuan Indians, both past\r\nand present, give the name of Bath\xc3\xa1la [God] to the image of the Holy\r\nChild, which is supposed to have been left by the celebrated\r\nMagallanes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[318] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[319] MS. 5,650 mentions only the artillery. The \xe2\x80\x9ctromb\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrunk\xe2\x80\x9d was a kind of hand rocket-tube made of wood and hooped with\r\niron, and was used for discharging wild-fire or Greek-fire (see\r\nCorbett\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish War, 1585\xe2\x80\x9387 [London], 1898, p. 335). At this\r\npoint Stanley discontinues the narrative of MS. 5,650, and translates\r\nfrom Amoretti\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Italian MS.\r\n\r\n[320] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cto better instruct and confirm him in the\r\nfaith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[321] Eden says the queen was preceded by \xe2\x80\x9cthree younge damo\xc5\xbfelles\r\nand three men with theyr cappes in theyr handes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[322] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand presentation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[323] MS. 5,650 reads simply for this last clause: \xe2\x80\x9cand several\r\nothers,\xe2\x80\x9d omitting all the names.\r\n\r\n[324] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cand they all so swore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[325] MS. 5,650 reads from this point: \xe2\x80\x9cThen they swore, and thus the\r\ncaptain caused the king to swear by that image, by the life of the\r\nemperor his sovereign, and by his habit, to ever remain faithful and\r\nsubject to the emperor,\xe2\x80\x9d thus ascribing this oath to the king instead\r\nof to Magalh\xc3\xa3es. The words \xe2\x80\x9cby his habit\xe2\x80\x9d can refer only to\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es, who wore that of Santiago, and not to any habit worn by the\r\nbarbaric ruler of Ceb\xc3\xba.\r\n\r\n[326] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand hang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[327] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand deck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[328] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand demolished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[329] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand overthrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[330] There is a strange difference between the Italian MS. and MS.\r\n5,650 in regard to these names. The latter reads to this point:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a number of villages in that island, whose names and those\r\nof their chiefs are as follows: Cinghapola, Cilaton, Ciguibucan,\r\nCimaningha, Cimaticat, and Cicambul; another, Mandaui, and its chief\r\nand seignior, Lambuzzan; another Cot-cot, and its chief, Acibagalen;\r\nanother, Puzzo, and its chief, Apanoan; another, Lalan, and its chief,\r\nTheteu; another, Lulutan, and its chief, Tapan [Amoretti, followed by\r\nStanley, says Japau, and Mosto, Iapan]; another Cilumay; and also\r\nLubucun.\xe2\x80\x9d Amoretti, who places this list after the disastrous battle\r\nand consequent treachery of the Cebuans, and Stanley, have \xe2\x80\x9cLubucin:\r\nits chief is Cilumai.\xe2\x80\x9d Mandaui is Mandaue; Lalan may be Liloan;\r\nCot-cot is on the east coast; Lubucun may be Lub\xc3\xba, but Mosto (p. 78,\r\nnote 3) conjectures it to be Lambusan. An examination of the Nancy MS.\r\nmay reveal the source of this difference.\r\n\r\n[331] MS. 5,650 adds after the word borchies: \xe2\x80\x9cinstruments so\r\ncalled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[332] Probably cotton cloth. See Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s East African and Malabar\r\nCoasts, p. 65: \xe2\x80\x9cThey make there [i.e., in Cambay] many cloths of\r\nwhite cotton, fine and coarse, and other woven and colored fabrics, of\r\nall kinds and colours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[333] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand closed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[334] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cShe who has killed the hog, puts a lighted\r\ntorch in her mouth, which she extinguishes, and which she holds\r\nconstantly alight with her teeth during that ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[335] Cf. the ceremonies of the baylanes described by Loarca, Vol. V,\r\npp. 131, 133, and by Chirino, Vol. XII, p. 270.\r\n\r\n[336] Otorno: Mosto, p. 79, mistranscribes otoro, and queries Attorno\r\nin a note.\r\n\r\n[337] MS. 5,650 omits the description of this custom, giving only the\r\nfirst and last sentence to this point.

He says: \xe2\x80\x9cNot farre from this Ilande of Zubut, is the Hand\r\nof Mathan, who\xc5\xbfe inhabitauntes v\xc5\xbfe maruelous ceremonies in theyr\r\n\xc5\xbfacrifices to the \xc5\xbfoone and burying the deade. They were rynges of\r\ngold abowt theyr priuie members.\xe2\x80\x9d In the description of the battle in\r\nMatan, Eden says that each of the three divisions of the islanders\r\ncontained \xe2\x80\x9ctwo thou\xc5\xbfand and fiftie men armed with bowes, arrowes,\r\ndartes and iauelins hardened at the poyntes with fyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[345] To this point the Italian MS. and MS. 5,650 agree approximately.\r\nThe story of the battle in the latter MS., however, is much abridged\r\nand much less graphic. It is as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThey replied that they had\r\nbamboo spears and stakes burned and hardened in the fire, and that we\r\ncould attack them when we wished. At daybreak, forty-nine of us leaped\r\ninto the water, in the place whither we had thus gone, at a distance of\r\nmore than three [sic] crossbow flights before we could reach shore, for\r\nthe boats could not approach nearer because of the rocks and reefs\r\nwhich were in the water. Thus we reached land, and attacked them. They\r\nwere arranged in three divisions, of more than one thousand five\r\nhundred persons. We shot many arrows at them from a distance, but it\r\nwas in vain, for they received them on their shields. They leaped\r\nhither and thither in such a way that scarce could we wound one of\r\nthem. On the other hand, our artillery in the boats was so far away\r\nfrom us that it could not aid us. Those people seeing that, and that\r\nthe captain had had some of their houses burned in order to inspire\r\nthem with terror, and having become more enraged, threw so many iron\r\npointed spears at us, and shot so many arrows even at the captain\r\nhimself that we could defend ourselves with difficulty. Finally, having\r\nbeen driven by them quite down to the shore, and while our captain was\r\nfighting bravely although wounded in the leg with an arrow, one of\r\nthose Indians hurled a poisoned bamboo lance into his face which laid\r\nhim stiff and dead. Then they pressed upon us so closely that we were\r\nforced to retire to our boats and to leave the dead body of the\r\ncaptain-general, with our other killed.\xe2\x80\x9d The eulogy on the dead\r\ncommander is approximately the same in both MSS., except at the end,\r\nwhere MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cEight of our men died there with him, and\r\nfour Indians, who had become Christians. Of the enemy fifteen were\r\nkilled by the artillery of the ships, which had at last come to our\r\naid, while many of us were wounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) says of the stay at Ceb\xc3\xba and the death\r\nof Magalh\xc3\xa3es: \xe2\x80\x9cThey stayed there about one month, and the majority\r\nof the people and the king became Christians. The king of Zub\xc3\xb3 ordered\r\nthe kings of the other islands to come to him, but inasmuch as two of\r\nthem refused to come, Magallanes, as soon as he learned it, resolved to\r\ngo to fight with them, and went to an island called Math\xc3\xa1. He set fire\r\nto a village, and not content with that, set out for a large\r\nsettlement, where he, his servant, and five Castilians were killed in\r\ncombat with the savages. The others, seeing their captain dead, went\r\nback to their boats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[346] Terciado: a Spanish word.\r\n\r\n[347] Carteava: a Spanish word.\r\n\r\n[348] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 12) dates the battle April 28. The\r\naccount of the battle is as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cFernan de Magalh\xc3\xa3es desired\r\nthat the other kings, neighbours to this one, should become subject to\r\nthis who had become Christian: and these did not choose to yield such\r\nobedience. Fernan de Magalh\xc3\xa3es seeing that, got ready one night with\r\nhis boats, and burned the villages of those who would not yield the\r\nsaid obedience; and a matter of ten or twelve days after this was done,\r\nhe sent to a village about half a league from that which he had burned,\r\nwhich is named Matam, and which is also an island, and ordered them to\r\nsend him at once three goats, three pigs, three loads of rice, and\r\nthree loads of millet for provisions for the ships; they replied that\r\nfor each article which he sent to ask them three of, they would send to\r\nhim by twos, and if he was satisfied with this they would at once\r\ncomply, if not, it might be as he pleased, but that they would not give\r\nit. Because they did not choose to grant what he demanded of them,\r\nFernan de Magalh\xc3\xa3es ordered three boats to be equipped with a matter\r\nof fifty or sixty men, and went against the said place, which was on\r\nthe 28th day of April, in the morning; there they found many people,\r\nwho might well be as many as three thousand or four thousand men, who\r\nfought with such a good will that the said Fernan de Magalh\xc3\xa3es was\r\nkilled there, with six of his men, in the year 1521.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[349] Navarrete (iv, pp. 65, 66) gives the names of the men killed with\r\nMagalh\xc3\xa3es on April 27 as follows: Christ\xc3\xb3bal Rabelo, then captain of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria;\xe2\x80\x9d Francisco Espinosa, a sailor; Anton Gallego, a\r\ncommon seaman; Juan de Torres, sobresaliente and soldier; Rodrigo\r\nNieto, servant of Juan de Cartagena; Pedro Gomez, servant of Gonzalo\r\nEspinosa; and Anton de Escovar, sobresaliente, wounded but died April\r\n29.\r\n\r\n[350] See Vol. I, pp. 325, 326, note 215*.\r\n\r\n[351] MS. 5,650 gives this name as Duart Bobase, although lower it is\r\nspelled Barbase. Duarte or Odoardo Barbosa, the son of Diogo Barbosa,\r\nwho after serving in Portugal, became alcaide of the Sevilla arsenal,\r\nwas born at Lisbon at the end of the fifteenth century. He spent the\r\nyears 1501\xe2\x80\x931516 in the Orient, the result of that stay being his\r\nLivro emque d\xc3\xa0 rela\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o do que viu e ouviu no Oriente, which was\r\nfirst published at Lisbon in 1813 in vol. vii of Collec\xc3\xa7ao de noticias\r\npara a historia et geographia das na\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb5es ultramarinas, and its\r\ntranslation by Stanley, A description of the coasts of East Africa and\r\nMalabar (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1866). He became a clerk\r\nin the Portuguese factory at Cananor under his uncle Gil Fernandez\r\nBarbosa, and became so expert in the Malabar language that he was said\r\nto speak it even better than the natives. On account of his facility in\r\nthe language he had been appointed commissioner by Nuno da Cunha to\r\nnegotiate peace with the Zamorin. He was commissioned in 1515 to\r\noversee the construction of some galleys by Alboquerque. While at\r\nSevilla, Magalh\xc3\xa3es lived in the household of Diogo Barbosa, where he\r\nmarried Duarte\xe2\x80\x99s sister Beatriz. Duarte embarked on the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad\xe2\x80\x9d as a sobresaliente, and it was he who captured the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictoria\xe2\x80\x9d from the mutineers at Port St. Julian, after which he\r\nbecame captain of that vessel. Failing to recover Magalh\xc3\xa3es body from\r\nthe natives of Mact\xc3\xa1n, he was himself slain at Ceb\xc3\xba at the fatal\r\nbanquet May 1, 1521. Besides the above book, which is a most valuable\r\ncontribution to early Oriental affairs, there is extant in the Torre do\r\nTombo a letter written by him from Cananor, January 12, 1513,\r\ncomplaining of the Portuguese excesses. See Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Magellan;\r\nStanley\xe2\x80\x99s Vasco da Gama; Birch\xe2\x80\x99s Alboquerque; and Hoefer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nNouvelle Biographie G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale (Paris, 1855)\r\n\r\n[352] See ante, note 147.\r\n\r\n[353] Magalh\xc3\xa3es married Beatriz Barbosa, daughter of Diogo Barbosa in\r\nSevilla, probably in the year 1517. One son Rodrigo was born of the\r\nunion, who was about six months old at the time of the departure.\r\nRodrigo died in September, 1521, and in the March following Beatriz\r\ndied. See Guillemard, ut supra, pp. 89\xe2\x80\x9391, 322.\r\n\r\n[354] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand to advise the Christian king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[355] Mosto transcribes this word wrongly as facente, \xe2\x80\x9cbusy.\xe2\x80\x9d MS.\r\n5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cwiser and more affectionate than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[356] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[357] The constable was Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, who was left behind\r\nwith the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad\xe2\x80\x9d and was one of the four survivors of that\r\nill-fated vessel, returning to Spain long after.\r\n\r\n[358] This sentence is confused in MS. 5,650, reading: jehan Caruaie\r\nauecques le bari\xc5\xbfel \xc5\xbfen retourner\xe1\xba\xbdt qui nous dirent comment jlz\r\nauoyent veu mener celluy quy fut guery par miracle et le pre\xc5\xbftre a \xc5\xbfa\r\nmai\xc5\xbfon et que pour cela jlz \xc5\xbfen e\xc5\xbftoyent partiz eulx doubtans de\r\nquelque male aduanture. By dropping the first et this becomes\r\nequivalent to the text.\r\n\r\n[359] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cfor we would kill him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[360] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cBut Jehan Carvaie, his comrade, and others\r\nrefused, for fear lest they would not remain masters there if the boat\r\nwent ashore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn regard to Jo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o\xe2\x80\x99s death, Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309)\r\nsays: \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as the men in the ships saw that slaughter, they\r\nhoisted their anchors, and tried to set sail in order to return to\r\nBurneo. At that juncture, the savages brought Juan Serrano, one of\r\nthose whom they wished to ransom, and asked two guns and two bahars of\r\ncopper for him, besides some Brittanias or linens such as they carried\r\nin the ships as merchandise of trade and barter. Serrano told them to\r\ntake him to the ship and he would give them what they asked, but they,\r\non the contrary, insisted that those things be taken ashore. But [the\r\nmen in the ships] fearing another act of treachery like the past, set\r\nsail, and abandoned that man there, and nothing more was heard of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[361] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 13) says nothing about the\r\nbanquet, but says that the men, twenty-eight in number, counting the\r\ntwo captains, went ashore to ask pilots to Borneo, whereupon the\r\nnatives, who had determined upon their course of action attacked and\r\nkilled them. Peter Martyr (Mosto, p. 81, note 5) asserts that the\r\nviolation of the women by the sailors was the cause of the massacre.\r\nConcerning the number killed, Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that\r\nthirty-five or thirty-six men went ashore, and Castanheda and Gomara\r\nsay thirty, the last asserting that a like number were made slaves, of\r\nwhom eight were sold in China. Peter Martyr places the number of the\r\nslain at twelve. Navarrete (iv, pp. 66, 67) gives the names of those\r\nmassacred as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Duarte Barbosa            captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    Juan Serrano              captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cConcepcion\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    Luis Alfonso de Gois      captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    Andres de S.

See ante,\r\nnote 26.\r\n\r\n[362] Chiacare: the nangca; see Vol. XXXIV, p. 107, where Pigafetta\r\ndescribes and names this fruit. Mosto confuses it with the durio\r\nxibethenus, which is abundant in the western islands of the Indian\r\narchipelagoes, Mindanao being the only one of the Philippines where it\r\nis found (Crawfurd, Dictionary); but it is the Artocarpus integrifolia\r\n(see Vol. XVI, p. 88, note 72). MS. 5,650 makes this \xe2\x80\x9ccapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[363] MS. 5,650 omits mention of the panicum, sorgo, garlic, and\r\nnangcas.\r\n\r\n[364] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cone to the east northeast, and the other to\r\nthe west southwest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[365] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cand eleven minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[366] Stanley says wrongly 154\xc2\xb0.\r\n\r\n[367] This word ends a page in the original Italian MS. On the\r\nfollowing page is a repetition of the title: Vocabili deli populi\r\ngentilli, that is \xe2\x80\x9cWords of those heathen peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d MS. 5,650 does\r\nnot contain this list, and it is also omitted by Stanley.\r\n\r\n[368] See ante, note 160.\r\n\r\n[369] Bassag bassag does not correspond to \xe2\x80\x9cshin,\xe2\x80\x9d but to \xe2\x80\x9cbasket\r\nfor holding clothes, etc.,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccartilage of the nose;\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\npossibly to basac basac, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sound made by falling water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[370] The equivalent of Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s dana is daoa or daua,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmillet.\xe2\x80\x9d Mais, probably the equivalent of humas is the word for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpanicum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[371] Tahil is found in the Tag\xc3\xa1log dictionaries, and is the name of a\r\nspecific weight, not weight in general. It is the Chinese weight called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctael,\xe2\x80\x9d which was introduced by the Chinese into the East Indies,\r\nwhence it spread throughout the various archipelagoes. See Crawfurd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDictionary; and Vols. III, p. 192, note 57; IV, p. 100, note 11; and\r\nVII, p. 88.\r\n\r\n[372] See Note 582, post.\r\n\r\n[373] Tinapay (used also by the Bicols to denote any kind of bread)\r\ndenotes a kind of cake or loaf made with flour and baked about the size\r\nof a chocolate-cup saucer. Two of these are put together before baking\r\nwith some sugar between. The word is extended also to wheat bread and\r\nto the hosts. See Encarnaci\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s Diccionario.\r\n\r\n[374] Amoretti\xe2\x80\x99s conjectured reading of sonaglio\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9chawk\xe2\x80\x99s-bell\xe2\x80\x9d) for conaglio (see Mosto, p. 83), proves correct\r\nfrom the Visayan dictionaries.\r\n\r\n[375] Baloto signifies a canoe dug out of a single log. One of twenty\r\nvaras in length is termed bilis, while the hull alone is called\r\ndal\xc3\xa1mas.\r\n\r\n[376] Most of the words of Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s Visayan vocabulary can be\r\ndistinguished in the dictionaries of that language, although it is\r\nnecessary to make allowance at times for Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s Italian phonetic\r\nrendering. Following is a list of the words that can be distinguished\r\nfrom Diccionario bisaya-espa\xc3\xb1ol y espa\xc3\xb1ol-bisaya (Manila, 1885), by\r\nJuan F\xc3\xa9lix de la Encarnaci\xc3\xb3n, O.S.A.

The general Visayan word for \xe2\x80\x9cman\xe2\x80\x9d is tao or tauo,\r\nalthough Mallat gives a form dala, which may correspond to the lac of\r\nPigafetta (but see Vol. V, p. 123, where the origin of the words lalac,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cman,\xe2\x80\x9d and babaye, \xe2\x80\x9cwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d are given by Loarca). Babaye\r\n(babae) is the general word for \xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmarried woman;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhile binibini is given by Mallat as the Tag\xc3\xa1log equivalent of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgirl,\xe2\x80\x9d and by Santos in his Vocabulario de la lengua tagala\r\n(Manila, 1835) as the equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cinfluential woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Liog is\r\nused for both \xe2\x80\x9cthroat\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cneck.\xe2\x80\x9d Tian is properly\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbelly,\xe2\x80\x9d and the mistake would arise naturally in Pigafetta\r\npointing to himself when desiring the word for \xe2\x80\x9cbody,\xe2\x80\x9d which would\r\nbe construed by the natives to that particular part toward which he\r\nhappened to point. Boto is used for both the male and female generative\r\norgans, especially the latter, as well as for the testicles. Britiis\r\ncorresponds to both \xe2\x80\x9cshin\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccalf of the leg.\xe2\x80\x9d Iro denotes\r\nalso the civet cat. Bulan the equivalent of Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s bolon is the\r\nword for \xe2\x80\x9cmoon\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cstar.\xe2\x80\x9d The occurrence of what are\r\ntoday Tag\xc3\xa1log forms in Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s list shows how the various\r\ndialects shade into one another and how the one has retained words that\r\nhave sunk into disuse in the other.\r\n\r\n[377] Preceding this paragraph in the Italian MS. (folio 38b) is the\r\nchart of the island of Panilonghon (Panisonghon; q.v., p. 202). It is\r\ngiven on folio 51a of MS. 5,650, preceded by the words: \xe2\x80\x9cBelow is\r\nshown the islands of Panilonghon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[378] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, pp. 13, 14) says that the captains\r\nelected in place of those killed at Ceb\xc3\xba were \xe2\x80\x9cJoam Lopez\r\n[Carvalho], who was the chief treasurer\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cbe captain-major of\r\nthe fleet, and the chief constable of the fleet\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cbe captain of\r\none of the ships; he was named Gonzalo Vaz Despinosa.\xe2\x80\x9d Pigafetta\r\nmakes no mention at all of Elcano, who brought the \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria\xe2\x80\x9d home;\r\nboth the above captains remaining with the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad.\xe2\x80\x9d When the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConcepcion\xe2\x80\x9d was burned, only one hundred and fifteen men were left\r\nfor the working of the two ships (see Guillemard, ut supra, p. 267),\r\nalthough the \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 14) says one hundred and eight\r\nmen, and Barros, one hundred and eighty.\r\n\r\n[379] In Eden: \xe2\x80\x9cPauiloghon, where they founde blacke men lyke vnto\r\nthe Sara\xc5\xbfins.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the island of Panglao and the \xe2\x80\x9cblack men\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nare the Negritos. See W. A. Reed\xe2\x80\x99s Negritos of Zambales, published by\r\nDepartment of the Interior \xe2\x80\x9cEthnological Survey Publications\xe2\x80\x9d ii,\r\npart i (Manila, 1904), which says (p. 20) that the only large islands,\r\nbesides Luz\xc3\xb3n, inhabited at present by Negritos are Panay, Negros,\r\nMindanao, and Paragua, although they do inhabit some of the smaller\r\nislands. The pure type is decreasing through marriage with the Bukidnon\r\nor mountain Visayans; and (p. 22) \xe2\x80\x9cso far there is no evidence that\r\nNegritos exist on Cebu, Bohol, Samar, and Leyte. The Negrito population\r\nof the Philippines is probably not in excess of 25,000. The U. S.\r\ncensus report of 1900 gives to Panglao a population of 14,347, all\r\ncivilized. See also Census of the Philippines, i, pp. 411, 415, 436,\r\n468, 478, 532, 533.\r\n\r\n[380] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen entering that house, we were preceded by\r\nmany reed and palmleaf torches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[381] These two words are omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[382] See Crawfurd\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary, pp. 368, 369, on the origin and use\r\nof rice in the eastern islands, and the etymology of the native names\r\nfor that grain; and Census of the Philippines, iv.\r\n\r\n[383] Instead of this last clause, MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cwhere he slept\r\nwith his principal wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[384] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cin the houses of the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[385] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9clittle valleys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[386] Cf. Vol. III, pp. 56, 57.\r\n\r\n[387] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[388] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cCalanoa;\xe2\x80\x9d and Eden: \xe2\x80\x9cCalauar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[389] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cone hundred and sixty-six;\xe2\x80\x9d and Eden:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c170.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[390] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 221) reads as follows when relating the\r\ncourse of the ships on leaving Ceb\xc3\xba: \xe2\x80\x9cWe left Subu and sailed\r\nsouthwest to a latitude of 9 and three-fourths degrees, between the end\r\nof Subu and an island called Bohol. Toward the western end of Subu lies\r\nanother island, by name, Panilongo, which is inhabited by blacks. That\r\nisland and Subu contain gold and considerable ginger. The former lies\r\nin 9 and one-third degrees and Subu in 10 and one-third degrees.\r\nAccordingly we left that channel and went 10 leguas south and anchored\r\nin the island of Bohol. There we made two ships of the three, burning\r\nthe third, because we had no men. The last-named island lies in 9 and\r\none-half degrees. We left Bohol and sailed southwest toward Quipit, and\r\nanchored at that settlement on the right hand side of a river. On the\r\nnorthwest and open side are two islets which lie in 8 and one-half\r\ndegrees. We could get no food there, for the people had none, but we\r\nmade peace with them. That island of Quipit contains a quantity of\r\ngold, ginger, and cinnamon. Accordingly, we determined to go in search\r\nof food. The distance from the headland of Quipit to the first islands\r\nis about 112 leguas. It and the islands lie in an east by north and\r\nsouth by west direction; and this island [i.e., Mindanao] extends quite\r\ngenerally east and west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 14) calls the port of Quipit (which is\r\nlocated on the northeastern coast of Mindanao) Capyam or Quype.\r\nCarvalho gave the boat of the burned ship to the inhabitants of that\r\nplace. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that they learned the\r\nlocation of Borneo at Mindanao. Quipit becomes Gibith in Transylvanus,\r\nChipico in Peter Martyr, and Quepindo in Barros (see Mosto, p. 84, note\r\n2).\r\n\r\n[391] The first European mention of the island of Luz\xc3\xb3n. Luz\xc3\xb3n is\r\nderived from the Malay l\xc3\xa2sung (Tagalog, losong), \xe2\x80\x9cmortar.\xe2\x80\x9d See\r\nCrawfurd\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary, pp. 222, 223.\r\n\r\n[392] Pigafetta evidently means the Chinese by the Lequians who are\r\nknown to have carried on trade for many years with the Philippines, and\r\nwho indeed, once owned them.\r\n\r\nFollowing this paragraph in the Italian MS. (folio 40a) is the chart of\r\nCaghaiam (q.v., p. 202). This chart is shown on folio 53b in MS. 5,650,\r\npreceded by the words: \xe2\x80\x9cBelow is shown the island of Caghaian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[393] MS. 5,650 does not mention the cuirasses.\r\n\r\n[394] Eden reads: \xe2\x80\x9c40. leagues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[395] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 221) says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe left that place [i.e.,\r\nQuipit] and sailed west southwest, southwest, and west, until we came\r\nto an island containing very few inhabitants and called Quagayan. We\r\nanchored in the northern part of that island, where we asked for the\r\nlocation of the island of Poluan, in order to get provisions of rice,\r\nfor that island contains it in abundance, and many ships are laden\r\nthere for other districts. Accordingly we sailed west northwest and\r\ncame across the headland of the island of Poluan.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Stanley, p. 14) calls Cagaiam, Caram. It is the island of Cagayan\r\nSulu, which lies northeast of Borneo.\r\n\r\n[396] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 15) says that the ships contained\r\nonly sufficient provisions for a week.\r\n\r\n[397] Eden reads: \xe2\x80\x9cC.lxxix. degrees and a third parte.\xe2\x80\x9d MS. 5,650\r\nreads: \xe2\x80\x9cone hundred and sixty-one and one-third degrees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[398] Occurrences at Palawan are given as follows by Albo (Navarrete,\r\niv, pp. 221, 222): \xe2\x80\x9cThen we sailed north by east along the coast [of\r\nPalawan] until we reached a village called Saocao, where we made peace.\r\nIts inhabitants were Moros. We went to another village of Cafres, where\r\nwe bartered for a considerable quantity of rice, and consequently laid\r\nin a good supply of provisions. That coast extends northeast and\r\nsouthwest. The headland of its northeastern part lies in 9 and\r\none-third degrees, and that of the southwestern part in 8 and one-third\r\ndegrees. Then on returning to the southwest quite to the headland of\r\nthis island, we found an island near which is a bay. In this course and\r\nalong Poluan many shoals are found. This headland lies east and west\r\nwith Quipit and northeast by east and southwest by west with\r\nQuagayan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, pp. 15\xe2\x80\x9317) gives a fuller account of\r\noccurrences at Palawan. At the first settlement at which they attempt\r\nto land, the natives prove hostile, whereupon they go toward another\r\nisland, but contrary weather compelling them to anchor near Palawan,\r\nthey are invited ashore on that island by the people of another\r\nvillage. There one of the soldiers, Joam de Campos, lands alone in\r\norder to get provisions. Being received kindly at this port, named\r\nDyguasam (perhaps Puerto Princesa), the people set about preparing\r\nprovisions for the strangers. Then going to another nearby village,\r\nwhere Carvalho makes peace with the chief, provisions of rice, goats,\r\nand swine are bought. At the latter village, a Portuguese-speaking\r\nnegro who has been baptized at the Moluccas, is met, who promises to\r\nguide them to Borneo, but he fails them at the last moment. Capturing a\r\nprau and three Moros near the former village, they are guided to\r\nBorneo. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that the two ships remained\r\na month in Palawan, \xe2\x80\x9ca rich country, where they got new directions\r\nabout Burneo, and captured two men to guide them there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point in the Italian MS.

(See Mosto, p. 87, note 3). Crawfurd\r\n(Dictionary, p. 72) conjectures that it is some place in Banjarmasin.\r\n\r\n[419] The journey to Borneo, events there, and a description of Borneo\r\nare thus described by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 222): \xe2\x80\x9cWe sailed from\r\nPoluan to Borney. Coasting the above named island [i.e., Poluan] to its\r\nsouthwest headland, we discovered an island with a shoal on its eastern\r\nside, and which lies in 7 and one-half degrees, so that we had to\r\ndeviate to the west for about fifteen leguas. Then we sailed southwest\r\ncoasting along the island of Borney to a city of the same name. You\r\nmust needs know that the land must be approached closely, for there are\r\nmany shoals outside, and one must keep the sounding line in constant\r\nuse, for it is a harsh coast. Borney is a large city with a very large\r\nbay. Both inside and outside of it are many shoals, so that a native\r\npilot of that place is necessary. We remained there for a considerable\r\nnumber of days, and commenced to trade there and made firm friendship.\r\nBut later, many canoes, in number 260, were equipped to capture us and\r\ncame upon us. When we saw them, we left hurriedly, and sailed out of\r\nthe bay, whereupon we saw some junks coming. We went to them and\r\ncaptured one, in which was a son of the king of Luzon. The latter is a\r\nvery large island. The captain afterward let him go [i.e., the prince\r\nof Luz\xc3\xb3n] without asking advice of anyone. Borney it a large island\r\nwhich yields cinnamon, mirabolans, and camphor, the last named of which\r\nis much esteemed in these lands, and it is said that when people die\r\nthey are embalmed with it. Borney (that is, the port of Borney) lies in\r\na latitude of 5 degrees and 25 minutes, and a longitude of 201 degrees\r\nand 5 minutes from the line of demarcation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, pp. 17\xe2\x80\x9320) says that while on the way to\r\nBorneo, the ships anchor at islands which they call the islets of St.\r\nPaul (now, the Mantanani Islands\xe2\x80\x94Guillemard, Magellan, p. 269) at a\r\ndistance of two and one-half or three leagues from Borneo. Proceeding\r\npast a lofty mountain (Kina Balu\xe2\x80\x94Guillemard) in Borneo, they coast\r\nthat island to the port of Borneo. Anchoring in that port, the Moro\r\npilots captured at Palawan are sent ashore with one of the crew, and on\r\nreaching the city of Borneo, they are taken before the Shahbender of\r\nBorneo. The two ships draw in closer to the city and establish trade\r\nwith the natives. Gonzalo Gomez Espinosa is chosen ambassador to the\r\nking to whom he takes a present. After a stay of twenty-three days in\r\nBorneo, the men in the ships fearing treachery from the evolutions of a\r\nnumber of praus and junks, attack and capture one of the latter with\r\ntwenty-seven men. Next morning the junk commanded by the son of the\r\nking of Luzon and ninety men, are captured. Of the seven men ashore the\r\nking sends two to the ships, but retains the others, whereupon the\r\nships leave, taking with them fourteen men and three women of those\r\ncaptured in the junks. While sailing back over their downward course,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad\xe2\x80\x9d grounds on a point of the island of Borneo, where it\r\nremains for four hours until swung clear by the tide.\r\n\r\nBrito in his account (Navarrete, iv, pp. 309, 310) says that the\r\nBorneans fear at first lest the strangers be Portuguese and that their\r\nobject is conquest, but finally being reassured by Espinosa who takes a\r\npresent to the king, pilots are promised as far as Mindanao. During\r\ntheir stay of a month at Borneo, two Greeks desert the ships. Three\r\nothers, among them Carvalho\xe2\x80\x99s son, are ashore when the fear of attack\r\ninstigated by the two Greeks leads the two ships to attack the\r\nBorneans, and the five men are left behind on the island.\r\n\r\nThe island of Borneo, the largest island (properly so-called) in the\r\nworld, is mentioned first by Varthema (Travels, Hakluyt Society\r\nedition), pp. 246\xe2\x80\x93248. See also Crawfurd\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary, pp. 57\xe2\x80\x9366.\r\nSee also Henry Ling Roth\xe2\x80\x99s Natives of Sarawak and British North\r\nBorneo (London, 1896) in two volumes, which is an excellent work on\r\nmodern conditions in Borneo.\r\n\r\n[420] The word \xe2\x80\x9cjunk\xe2\x80\x9d is probably derived from the Malay Jong or\r\nAjong \xe2\x80\x9ca great ship.\xe2\x80\x9d For a description of these ships, see\r\nYule\xe2\x80\x99s Cathay (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1866), ii, pp.\r\n417, 418.\r\n\r\n[421] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cIf venom or poison be put in a vase of fine\r\nporcelain, it breaks immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d In accordance with this reading we\r\nhave added in brackets in the Italian the word veleno, i.e.,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoison,\xe2\x80\x9d which seems to have been omitted by the amanuensis. Mosto\r\n(p. 88, note 3) quotes the following from Marcantonio Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nItinerario da Vienna a Constantinopoli (p. 208), when speaking of the\r\npresent brought to Sultan Selim II by the Persian ambassador which\r\nconsisted of \xe2\x80\x9ceight dishes [piati firuarii] which break if any one\r\nputs poison in them. Those piati firuarii are made of the substance\r\nwhich we call porcelain, and are made in China, the province situated\r\nin the extreme outskirts of the Orient. They are made of earth, which\r\nis kept for more than fifty years buried in the earth, in order to\r\nrefine it, and which is buried by the father for his son. Thus it\r\npasses from hand to hand.\xe2\x80\x9d See also Yule\xe2\x80\x99s Cathay, ii, p. 478; and\r\nBurnell and Tiele\xe2\x80\x99s Linschoten (Hakluyt Society publications), i, pp.\r\n129, 130.\r\n\r\n[422] The small brass, copper, tin, and zinc coins common throughout\r\nthe eastern islands were called \xe2\x80\x9cpichis\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpitis,\xe2\x80\x9d which was\r\nthe name of the ancient Javanese coin, now used as a frequent\r\nappellative for money in general. Chinese coins were early in general\r\nuse throughout the southern islands of the eastern archipelagoes. See\r\nCrawfurd\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary, pp. 285\xe2\x80\x93288.\r\n\r\n[423] The cate or catty. See Vol. XVIII, p. 141, note 32.\r\n\r\n[424] MS. 5,650 mentions only the six porcelain dishes, the wax, and\r\nthe pitch, for the last eighty, instead of forty, cathils, of bronze\r\nbeing traded. The bahar of the Italian MS. becomes \xe2\x80\x9cbarrel\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccask\xe2\x80\x9d in the French. The anime (pitch) may have been one of the\r\nnumerous resins yielded by various trees in the Philippines (see Report\r\nof Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, 282, 283).\r\n\r\n[425] MS. 5,650 omits this word.\r\n\r\n[426] Spectacles were invented in the thirteenth century; and the\r\ncredit for the invention is assigned to Alessandro d\xc3\xac Spina, a\r\nFlorentine monk, or to Roger Bacon.\r\n\r\n[427] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cnot to wash the buttocks with the left hand;\r\nnot to eat with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[428] Stanley (p. 116) omits a portion of this paragraph. He says that\r\nhad Pigafetta been a Spaniard or Portuguese, he would not have written\r\nas he did concerning the Mahometan laws, as he would have been better\r\ninformed. Notwithstanding the fact that Stanley was a convert to\r\nIslamism and a student of that faith, some of these practices may have\r\nbeen introduced into Borneo, as the rites there being far from their\r\ncenter, may have become vitiated or imperfectly learned in the first\r\nplace. For instance, that the law was not strictly observed there is\r\nseen from the fact recorded by Pigafetta that they used the intoxicant\r\narrack.\r\n\r\n[429] MS. 5,650 says simply that the camphor exudes in small drops. The\r\nMalay camphor tree (dipterocarpus or Dryabalanops camphora) is\r\nconfined, so far as known, to a few parts of the islands of Sumatra and\r\nBorneo, where it is very abundant. The oil (both fluid and solid) is\r\nfound in the body of the tree where the sap should be, but not in all\r\ntrees. The Malay name for camphor is a slight corruption of the\r\nSanskrit one \xe2\x80\x9ckarpura,\xe2\x80\x9d and to distinguish it from the camphor of\r\nChina and Japan, the word Barus is annexed (the name of the seaport of\r\nthe western coast of Sumatra, whence camphor was chiefly exported from\r\nthat island). The Malay variety is higher priced than the Chinese. See\r\nCrawfurd\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[430] MS. 5,650 omits mention of the turnips and cabbages, and adds:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chinds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[431] Immediately following this paragraph in the Italian MS. are three\r\ncharts: 1. On folio 45b, the chart of Burne (q.v., p. 210), at the\r\nlower (i.e., northern) end of which is a scroll reading \xe2\x80\x9cHere are\r\nfound the living leaves;\xe2\x80\x9d found on folio 60b of MS. 5,650, preceded\r\nby the words \xe2\x80\x9cChart of the island of Burne and the place where the\r\nliving leaves are found.\xe2\x80\x9d 2. On folio 46b, the chart of Mindanao,\r\nwhich is divided into the districts of Cippit, Butuam, Maingdanao,\r\nCalagan, and Benaiam (q.v., p. 230); found on folio 63a of MS. 5,650,\r\npreceded by the words \xe2\x80\x9cChart of five islands\xe2\x80\x94Benaian.\xe2\x80\x9d 3. On\r\nfolio 47a, the chart of the islands of Zzolo [i.e., Jol\xc3\xb3], Tagima, and\r\nChauit and Suban\xc3\xacn, (q.v., p. 230), accompanied by a scroll reading\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere pearls are produced;\xe2\x80\x9d found on folio 63b of MS. 5,650,\r\npreceded by the words \xe2\x80\x9cChart of the islands of Zzolo, Cauit, Tagima,\r\nand others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[432] Cape Sampanmangio (Guillemard, p. 274). See ante, note 418.\r\n\r\n[433] MS. 5,650 omits this sentence.\r\n\r\n[434] The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 20) also narrates the capture of\r\nthis junk.\r\n\r\n[435] In Eden: \xe2\x80\x9cCimbubon, beinge. viii. degrees aboue the\r\nEquinoctiall lyne.

It is called in the \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, p. 21), port Samta\r\nMaria de Agosto, (St. Mary of August) because it was reached on the\r\nfifteenth of August, the day of our Lady of August. It is assigned a\r\nlatitude of fully seven degrees. Herrera says that the ships were\r\noverhauled on Borneo itself. Guillemard (p. 274) interprets Pigafetta\r\nwrongly by saying that he assigns the careening place as Palawan or\r\nParagua.\r\n\r\n[436] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9ctwo and one-half feet long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[437] Cf. Transylvanus, Vol. I, pp. 330, 331. The Tridacna gigas,\r\ndescribed by Delgado, Historia, p. 929, under the name of taclobo.\r\nColin asserts that he saw one of the shells which was used as a\r\nwatering-trough and another as a holy-water font. The shells sometimes\r\nattain a length of five or six feet, and weigh hundreds of pounds. The\r\nnatives burn them for lime. See Official Handbook of Philippines\r\n(Manila, 1903), p. 152.\r\n\r\n[438] Mosto (p. 89, note 8) conjectures this to be a fish of the family\r\nof the Squamipen, perhaps of the genus Heniochus.\r\n\r\n[439] Coca: An Italian word formed from the Spanish word \xe2\x80\x9cchocar\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto jostle\xe2\x80\x9d (Mosto, p. 89, note 9). The living leaves, were the\r\ninsects of the genus of Phyllium of the order of the Orthoptera. They\r\nare known as walking leaves from their resemblance to a leaf.\r\n\r\n[440] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650. Eden says that Pigafetta\r\nkept the leaf \xe2\x80\x9cfor the \xc5\xbfpace of viii. dayes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[441] The date of the departure was September 27, 1521. At this place\r\nJo\xc3\xa3o Carvalho was deposed from the chief command for his high-handed\r\nmeasures and non-observance of royal orders, and retook his old\r\nposition as chief pilot. Espinosa was elected in his place and Elcano\r\nwas chosen captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria.\xe2\x80\x9d See Navarrete, iv, pp. 73,\r\n289, 292, 294.\r\n\r\n[442] Basilan; see Vol. III, p. 168, note 44.\r\n\r\n[443] The true pearl oysters of the Philippine Islands are found along\r\nthe coasts of Paragua, Mindanao, and in the Sulu Archipelago,\r\nespecially in the last named, where many very valuable pearls are\r\nfound. These fisheries are said to rank with the famous fisheries of\r\nCeylon and the Persian Gulf. The mother-of-pearl of the shells is more\r\nvaluable than the pearls. The Sultan of Jol\xc3\xb3 claims the fisheries as\r\nhis own and rents them out, but always has trouble with the lessees,\r\nand his ownership is disputed by the datos. The pearl fishery has\r\nfigured in a treaty between that sultan and the United States\r\ngovernment. See Affairs of Philippines, Hearing before U. S. Senate\r\nCommittee (Washington, 1902), part i, p. 18; Official Handbook of\r\nPhilippines (Manila, 1903), p. 153; and Census of Philippine Islands\r\n(Washington, 1905), pp. 534\xe2\x80\x93536. An early interesting account of\r\npearl-fishing is given by Eden (Arber\xe2\x80\x99s edition), pp. 213, 214.\r\n\r\n[444] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cfifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[445] C\xc3\xa1uit is a point and bay on the west coast of Zamboanga,\r\nMindanao; Subanin refers to a portion of Zamboanga; and the island of\r\nMonoripa is perhaps the island of Saccol, located at the southeastern\r\nend of the Zamboanga province. \xe2\x80\x9cSubanim\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Barrows (Census\r\nof the Philippines, i, p. 416) \xe2\x80\x9csuggests a settlement of the present\r\naborigines of that part of Mindanao, who are known as Subanon. Here,\r\ntoo, they saw the notorious \xe2\x80\x98sea-gypsies,\xe2\x80\x99 the Bajau or S\xc3\xa1mal\r\nLaut, whose wandering boats, then as now, shifted their stations with\r\nthe changing of the Monsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[446] Crawfurd (Dictionary, p. 100) says that the cinnamon of Mindanao\r\nis not very strong or valuable; but the Official Handbook of\r\nPhilippines (Manila, 1903) says (p. 114) that a cinnamon of stronger\r\ntaste and fragrance is found in Zamboanga, Caraga, and the mountain\r\ndistricts of Misamis, than that of Ceylon, although containing a bitter\r\nelement that depreciates its value, but which can be eliminated by\r\ncultivation. Many of the old writers describe the plant and its\r\ncultivation, one of the earliest being Varthema (Hakluyt Society\r\nedition), p. 191. Pigafetta\xe2\x80\x99s etymology of the Malay word is correct.\r\n\r\n[447] Mosto (p. 90) mistranscribes biguiday, and Stanley has (p. 121),\r\nbignaday. Perhaps it is the biniray, a boat resembling a large banca,\r\nor the binitan (see Pastells\xe2\x80\x99s Colin, i, p. 25).\r\n\r\n[448] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9cseventeen men seemingly as bold and ready as\r\nany others whom we had seen in those districts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[449] Stanley says (p. 122) that this was attributed by a newspaper of\r\n1874 to the Battas of Sumatra. Semper found the custom of eating the\r\nheart or liver of their slain enemies among the Manobos in eastern\r\nMindanao (Mosto, p. 91, note 2). Tribes of Malayan origin living in\r\nnorthern Luz\xc3\xb3n are said to have ceremonial cannibalism (Official\r\nHandbook of Philippines, p. 158).\r\n\r\n[450] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[451] At this point in the Italian MS. (folio 50a) is found the chart\r\nof Ciboco, Biraban Batolach, Sarangani, and Candigar (q.v., p. 238).\r\nThis chart is shown on folio 65a of MS. 5,650, preceded by the words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChart of the four islands of Ciboco, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[452] Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 223) calls these two islands Sibuco and\r\nVirano Batolaque, the first of which Mosto (p. 91, note 3) conjectures\r\nto be Sibago, and the second (note 4), part of the southern portion of\r\nMindanao. The first conjecture is probably correct if we take Albo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nword that the two ships turned to the southeast after passing the\r\nisland Sibuco; and the fact that the main west coast east of Zamboanga\r\nis remarkably free of islands, lends color to the second.\r\n\r\n[453] The islands of Balut and Sarangani, just south of the most\r\nsouthern point of Mindanao.\r\n\r\n[454] MS. adds: \xe2\x80\x9cwho are St. Elmo. St. Nicholas, and St. Clara.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[455] It is just such acts as this bit of lawlessness, together with\r\nthe unprovoked capture of inoffensive vessels, that show that the\r\ndiscipline of the ships had in great measure disappeared with the loss\r\nof Magalh\xc3\xa3es. Such acts amounted to nothing less than piracy.\r\n\r\n[456] These islands are of the Carcaralong or Karkaralong group south\r\nof Mindanao. Mosto conjectures Cabaluzao (Cabulazao on the chart) to be\r\nthe island of Kabalusu, and that of Lipan, to be Lipang. Valentyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nOud en Nieuw Oost-Indien (Dordrecht and Amsterdam; 1724), i, between\r\npp. 36 and 37, shows a group of islands at about this location with the\r\nnames Lirong (Lipan ?), Karkelang, Cabroewang Noessa (Nuza ?),\r\nKarkarotang, and Karotta.\r\n\r\n[457] At this point in the Italian MS. occur two charts: 1. On folio\r\n51a, the islands of Cauiao, Cabiao, Cabulazao, Lipan, Cheava, Camanuca,\r\nCheai, Nuza, and Sanghir (q.v., p. 242); in MS. 5,650 shown on folio\r\n65b, preceded by the words: \xe2\x80\x9cChart of the islands of Sanghir etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n2. On folio 51b, the islands of Cheama, Carachita, Para, Zangalura,\r\nCiau, Paghinzara, Talaut, Zoar, and Meau (q.v. p. 246); in MS. 5,650,\r\non folio 66b, preceded by the words: \xe2\x80\x9cChart of the islands of Meau,\r\netc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSanghir (now Sanguir) is called Sanguin by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p.\r\n223), and by Castanheda (Mosto, p. 92, note 1).\r\n\r\n[458] Of these islands (some of them in the Talantse group) Cheama is\r\nKima; Carachita is Karakitang; Para still retains that name, or is\r\ncalled Pala; Zanghalura is Sangalong or Sangaluan; Ciau is Siao or\r\nSian; Paghinzara (so called by Albo, ut supra) figures on Valentyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmap (ut supra, note 457) as Pangasare, though the same island seems\r\nalso to be called Tagulanda, so that Guillemard is right in his\r\nidentification of this island; it is identified with the island of\r\nRoang by the British Admiralty map of 1890, while Mosto conjectures\r\nthat it may be the island of Biaro. See Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Magellan, map,\r\nfacing p. 226; and Mosto, p. 92, notes 2\xe2\x80\x937.\r\n\r\n[459] MS. 5,650 gives this name as \xe2\x80\x9cBabintau.\xe2\x80\x9d That MS. adds:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll those islands are inhabited by heathens,\xe2\x80\x9d and continuing,\r\nreads: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is an island called Talant east of Cheama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[460] Talaut is evidently one of the Tulur islands east of Sanguir.\r\nZoar (called Suar by Albo) and Meau may be the islands of Meyo and\r\nTifore. See Guillemard (ut supra), and Mosto, p. 92, notes 8\xe2\x80\x9310. The\r\ngeography of the islands of the East India groups has not yet been set\r\nforth in a detailed and masterly manner, or definite proportions given\r\nto it, although it is a subject that merits enthusiastic research and\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n[461] Eden reads (p. 259): \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xc5\xbfyxte daye of Nouember and the.\r\nxxvii. monethe after theyr departure owt of Spayne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[462] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cby which they were deceived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlbo\xe2\x80\x99s narrative (Navarrete, iv, pp. 222\xe2\x80\x93224) of the events of the\r\ntwo ships from the time they leave Borneo to the arrival at the\r\nMoluccas is as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cWe left Borney, and returned by the road\r\nwhence we had come, and consequently took the channel between the\r\nheadland of the island of Borney and Poluan. Turning west [sic] we went\r\ntoward the island of Quagayan, and thus we went by that same route in\r\nsearch of the island of Quipit toward the south. On this course between\r\nQuipit and Cagayan, we saw to the southward an island called Solo,\r\nwhere many very large pearls are to be found. The king of that island\r\nis said to have a pearl as large as an egg. That island lies in a\r\nlatitude of 6 degrees. While on that course, we came across three small\r\nislets and farther on we met an island called Tagima, where many pearls\r\nare said to be found. The latter island lies northeast by east and\r\nsouthwest by west with Solo. Tagima lies in a latitude of 6 and\r\nfive-sixths degrees, and is located opposite the headland of Quipit.\r\nMany islets lie between those two islands, and one must take to the\r\nopen as he approaches Quipit. The abovenamed headland lies in 7 and\r\none-fourth degrees, and extends southeast and west northwest with\r\nPoluan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThence we coasted the island of Quipit going toward the south.\r\nTurning east by south we sailed toward certain rocky islets. Along the\r\ncoast many settlements are passed, where considerable excellent\r\ncinnamon grows, and for which we traded. That coast also produces a\r\nquantity of ginger. Then we sailed northeast until we saw a gulf,\r\nwhereupon we turned southeast until we saw a large island. There is a\r\nvery large settlement extending from that point to the eastern headland\r\nof the island of Quipit, and at the headland of the said island.\r\nConsiderable gold is obtained there from a very large river. That\r\nheadland lies 91 and one-half degrees from the meridian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe left Quipit for Maluco and turned southeast, where we saw an\r\nisland called Sibuco. Then we turned south southeast, where we saw\r\nanother island called Viramo Batolaque, continuing along that same\r\ncourse to the head of that island. Then we saw another island called\r\nCandicar, and sailed eastward between the two islands until we reached\r\na point some distance ahead, and at that place we entered a channel\r\nbetween Candicar and another island called Sarangani. We anchored at\r\nthe latter island and took a pilot for Maluco. Those two islands lie in\r\n4 and two-thirds degrees, while the headland of Quipit lies in 7 and\r\none-fourth degrees, the headland of Sibuco in 6 degrees south latitude,\r\nand the headland of Virano Batolaque in 5 degrees. From the headland of\r\nQuipit and Candicar, the course is north northwest and south southeast\r\nwithout meeting any headland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe left Sarangani and sailed south by east until we reached the\r\nright side of an island called Sanguin. Between the two islands lie a\r\nnumber of islets lying toward the west. Sanguin lies in 3 and\r\ntwo-thirds degrees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Sanguin we sailed south by east to an island called Sian.\r\nBetween those islands lie many rocky islets. The latter island lies in\r\nexactly 3 degrees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sailed south by west to an island called Paginsara, which lies in\r\n10 and one-sixth degrees. The course from that island to Sarangani is\r\nnorth by east and south by west and all those islands are sighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Paginsara we sailed south by east until we reached a position\r\nmidway between two islets which lie northeast and southwest from one\r\nanother. The one to the northeast is called Suar and the other Mean.\r\nThe first lies in 1 degree 45 minutes and the other in 1 and one-half\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sailed south southeast from Mean, until we sighted the islands of\r\nthe Malucos. Then we turned east and entered a channel between Mare and\r\nTidori, where we anchored. We were received there with the utmost\r\nfriendliness and established a firm peace. We built a house ashore in\r\norder to trade with those people, and abode there many days until the\r\nships were laden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, pp. 20\xe2\x80\x9323) says that after leaving\r\nBorneo, a small junk laden with cocoanuts was overhauled and captured,\r\nand that shortly after the ships were careened for repairs in the port\r\nof St. Mary of August (see ante, note 435). Steering southwest on again\r\nsetting sail, they come to the island of Fagajam (Cagayan) and that of\r\nSeloque (Solo or Jol\xc3\xb3), where they learn that pearls are abundant.\r\nNext they reach Quipe (Quipit), running between it and the island of\r\nTamgym (Tagima). \xe2\x80\x9cAnd always running along the coast of the said\r\nisland, and going thus, they fell in with a parao laden with sago in\r\nloaves, which is bread made of a tree which is named cajare, which the\r\npeople of that country eat as bread. This parao carried twenty-one men,\r\nand the chief of them had been in Maluco in the house of Francisco\r\nSerram, and having gone further along this island they arrived in sight\r\nof some islands which are named Semrryn.\xe2\x80\x9d A guide to Maluco is\r\nbargained for, but after arrangements are concluded he attempts to play\r\nfalse, whereupon he and some others are captured. The natives attempt\r\npursuit but are unable to overtake the two ships. Next day sighting an\r\nisland, and a calm coming upon them, while the currents drew the\r\nvessels in toward shore, the old pilot escapes. Continuing they sight\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthree high mountains belonging to a nation of people whom they call\r\nthe Salabos [Celebes?],\xe2\x80\x9d and shortly after desiring to take water at\r\na small island, they are deterred by one of their native pilots, who\r\nassures them that the people are hostile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile still in this\r\nneighborhood, they saw the islands themselves of Maluco, and for\r\nrejoicing they fired all the artillery, and they arrived at the island\r\non the 8th of November of 1521, so that they spent from Seville to\r\nMaluco two years, two months and twenty-eight days, for they sailed on\r\nthe 10th of August of 1519.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) places the distance from the\r\nLadrones to the Moluccas at 1,000 miles, the archipelago of St. Lazarus\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere there occur many islands\xe2\x80\x9d intervening.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the Italian MS. are found two charts, as follows: 1.\r\nOn folio 52b, a chart of the islands of Hiri, Tarenate, Mastara, and\r\nGiailonlo (q.v., p. 250), with the inscription \xe2\x80\x9cAll the islands shown\r\nin this book are in the other hemisphere, at the antipodes;\xe2\x80\x9d probably\r\nthe same chart appears on folio 73b of MS. 5,650 preceded by the words\r\n(in a different hand than most of that MS.): \xe2\x80\x9cHere follow the\r\ncloves.\xe2\x80\x9d 2. On folio 53a, a chart entitled \xe2\x80\x9cMaluco,\xe2\x80\x9d showing the\r\nislands Tadore, Mare, Pulongha, Mutir, and Machiam (q.v., Vol. XXXIV,\r\np. 72), with a tree bearing the inscription \xe2\x80\x9cCaui gomode, that is,\r\ncloves;\xe2\x80\x9d shown on folio 74a of MS. 5,650, preceded by the words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescription of the clove trees; how they grow; season for gathering;\r\nmethod of finding the best; and also of nutmegs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[463] Eden (p. 259) says that they entered port \xe2\x80\x9cbefore the ry\xc5\xbfinge\r\nof the \xc5\xbfoone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[464] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9cby astrology.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[465] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[466] MS. 5,650 omits the drinking-cups.\r\n\r\n[467] From this point this sentence reads as follows in MS. 5,650:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo some others we gave either silk cloth or some knives, or caps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[468] This sentence is omitted in MS. 5,650.\r\n\r\n[469] MS. 5,650 reads: \xe2\x80\x9ca royal presence and eloquence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[470] \xe2\x80\x9cMauzor\xe2\x80\x9d in Eden (p. 259).\r\n\r\n[471] MS. 5,650 does not mention the \xe2\x80\x9cquintalada.\xe2\x80\x9d The quintalada\r\nwas a per cent of the freight or of the lading space of the ship\r\nallowed the officers and crew of sailing vessels. The amount allowed to\r\neach of the officers and crews of Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s fleet was specified in\r\nsection 74 of the instructions given by C\xc3\xa1rlos I to Magalh\xc3\xa3es and\r\nFalero at Barcelona, May 8, 1519. The amounts (see Navarrete, iv, pp.\r\n150\xe2\x80\x93152) are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Following are declared the quintaladas which shall be laden in the\r\n    ships about to sail to the spice regions, and the amount which each\r\n    one shall lade, from which he will pay the twenty-fourth part to\r\n    his Highness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        Quintaladas\r\nFirst, Fernando de Magallanes and Falero,                        60\r\ncaptains-general of the said fleet will be allowed sixty\r\nquintals of cabin space [c\xc3\xa1mara] apiece\r\nItem: of quintalada, and twenty quintals apiece, these           20\r\ntwenty to be stowed below decks, and the cabin space\r\nabove decks\r\nThe other three captains shall each be allowed forty             40\r\nquintals of cabin space, ten of them quintalada\r\nTreasurer, twenty quintals of cabin space, and one               22\r\nquintalada below decks\r\nAccountant, a like amount of twenty-two quintals                 22\r\nNotaries of the ships, fifteen [sic] quintals of cabin           22\r\nspace and one quintalada\r\nAlguacil of the fleet, six quintals and one quintalada            8\r\nThe sailors of the ships, one and one-half quintalada             3\r\nChaplains, four quintals apiece                                   4\r\nPhysician and surgeon, five quintals apiece                       5\r\nMasters and pilots, twelve quintaladas of cabin space and        14\r\none quintalada apiece\r\nBoatswains, eight quintals of cabin space and one                10\r\nquintalada apiece\r\nSailors, one quintalada apiece                                    2\r\nCommon seamen, one and one-half quintals apiece                   1\xc2\xbd\r\nBoys, three arrobas of quintalada apiece                  3 arrobas\r\nGunners\r\nThe master gunners, three quintals of cabin space apiece          5\r\nand one quintalada\r\nThe other gunners, one and one-half quintaladas apiece            2\xc2\xbd\r\nCarpenters, one and one-half quintaladas                          2\xc2\xbd\r\nCalkers, the same                                                 2\xc2\xbd\r\nCoopers, the same                                                 2\xc2\xbd\r\nCrossbowmen, the same                                             2\xc2\xbd\r\nServants of the captains, one quintalada apiece                   1\r\nStewards, three quintals apiece                                   3\r\nStonecutters, three quintals apiece                               3\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case that our service is performed by building a fortress there, the\r\npersons abovementioned who shall remain in it, shall be allowed the\r\nsaid quintaladas in the ships that shall come [to these kingdoms], and\r\nthey shall receive also a like sum annually from the quintaladas that\r\nshall remain there.\r\n\r\nIf a fortress be made, our captain shall appoint such persons with the\r\nduties and functions that shall be necessary in the said fortress, and\r\nshall appoint them the competent recompense until we appoint to those\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\nChests\r\n\r\nThe captains-general shall take four chests, on which they will pay\r\nonly the twentieth                                                    4\r\nThe other captains shall take three chests apiece on the same terms   3\r\nAccountant and treasurer two chests apiece                            2\r\nThe notaries of the ships one chest apiece                            1\r\nMasters and pilots, each one chest                                    1\r\nBoatswains, one chest apiece                                          1\r\nAlguacil of the fleet, one chest                                      1\r\nChaplains, one chest apiece                                           1\r\nThe merinos of the fleets, one chest apiece                           1\r\nThe captains\xe2\x80\x99 servants, one chest for each two                        1\r\nPhysician and surgeon, one chest                                      1\r\nSailors, one chest for each two                                       1\r\nCommon seamen, one chest for each two                                 1\r\nBoys, one chest for each three                                        1\r\nMaster gunners of the ships, each one chest                           1\r\nThe other gunners, one chest for each two                             1\r\nCarpenters, calkers, coopers, masons, crossbowmen, and sailors, one\r\nchest for each two                                                    1\r\nStewards, one chest apiece                                            1\r\nSobresalientes, one chest apiece                                      1\r\n\r\n\r\n[472] Not nephew, as translated by Stanley (p. 126), as is shown later\r\nby the context.

It has been applied as a collective\r\nname to all the islands of their district, but it is correct of only\r\nthe five mentioned by Pigafetta (for whose ancient names, see Vol. XVI,\r\np. 221). Varthema (Travels, Hakluyt Society edition, pp. 245, 246),\r\ngives a slight account of the district under the name of the \xe2\x80\x9cisland\r\nof Monoch, where the cloves grow,\xe2\x80\x9d which Magalh\xc3\xa3es showed to C\xc3\xa1rlos\r\nI (Guillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Magellan, p. 102). Barbosa gives the first authentic\r\naccount of the five Moluccas (which he names) in his East African and\r\nMalabar Coasts (Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 201, 202, 219, 220. See\r\nalso Crawfurd\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary, pp. 283\xe2\x80\x93285.\r\n\r\n[476] Francisco Serr\xc3\xa3o, brother of Jo\xc3\xa3o Serr\xc3\xa3o, was Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmost intimate friend, and they had been close companions in the\r\nstirring years of early Portuguese operations in far eastern waters. In\r\n1509, Serr\xc3\xa3o sailed on the fleet sent by Almeida to reconnoiter\r\nMalacca. Having been sent ashore with a large force, he was attacked by\r\nthe Malays and only the prompt assistance headed by Magalh\xc3\xa3es saved\r\nhim. In January, 1510, while returning from the expedition, he suffered\r\nshipwreck. In 1511 he was sent as captain of one of three ships under\r\nAntonio d\xe2\x80\x99 Abreu to the Moluccas for purposes of exploration and\r\ntrade, but the expedition failed to reach the islands, going only as\r\nfar as the islands of Banda. On this expedition, Serr\xc3\xa3o\xe2\x80\x99s ship was\r\nabandoned as unseaworthy, and the junk bought in its stead was wrecked\r\non an island. Here pirates landing, Serr\xc3\xa3o and his men took possession\r\nof their boats and thus reached Amboina in safety. The opportunity\r\noffering, Serr\xc3\xa3o went to Ternate, where he espoused the cause of that\r\nking against the king of Tidore, by the latter of whom he was finally\r\npoisoned about the time of Magalh\xc3\xa3es\xe2\x80\x99s death. A number of letters\r\npassed between Magalh\xc3\xa3es and Serr\xc3\xa3o, during the years spent by the\r\nlatter in Ternate, and Magalh\xc3\xa3es made use of them to persuade C\xc3\xa1rlos\r\nI to undertake the expedition.

The testoon (tost\xc3\xa3o, tost\xc3\xb5es) is a\r\nPortuguese silver coin. It was first struck in the fifteenth century\r\n(Hazlitt\xe2\x80\x99s Coinage of European Continent).\r\n\r\n[478] It is impossible to be sure of the correct form of these names.\r\nMS. 5,650 gives them as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cChecchily Momoly, Tadore Vimghi,\r\nChecchily de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cilli Paggi, Chialin, Checchilin\r\nCatara, Vaiechuserich, and Colano Ghappi.\xe2\x80\x9d Amoretti (followed by\r\nStanley) makes these names \xe2\x80\x9cChechili-Momuli, Jadore Vunghi,\r\nChechilideroix, Cilimanzur, Cilipagi, Chialinchechilin, Cataravajecu,\r\nSerich, and Calanopagi.\xe2\x80\x9d Mosto gives the names as in the present\r\nedition with the exception of the sixth and seventh which he gives as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChialin Chechilin\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCathara.\xe2\x80\x9d Checheli (Chechelin) and\r\npossibly Cili, denotes the title Cachil (\xe2\x80\x9cnoble\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\r\n[479] Called by Barros \xe2\x80\x9cJo\xc3\xa3o de Lourosa, a man disloyal to his\r\ncountry (Mosto, p. 94, note 5). The \xe2\x80\x9cRoteiro\xe2\x80\x9d (Stanley, pp. 23,\r\n24), says that this man was found in the island of Targatell (Ternate)\r\nand that letters were sent him, asking him \xe2\x80\x9cto come and speak with\r\nthem, to which he replied that he did not dare, because the king of the\r\ncountry forbade it.\xe2\x80\x9d However, permission is secured from the king and\r\nLorosa comes to the ships. An extract from a letter from the Indies\r\n(Vol. I, p. 299) says that Lorosa was taken prisoner. Brito (Navarrete,\r\niv, p. 305) merely mentions the fact that he had left with the\r\nSpaniards. He remained with the \xe2\x80\x9cTrinidad,\xe2\x80\x9d and was promptly\r\nexecuted by the Portuguese when he fell into their hands (see\r\nGuillemard\xe2\x80\x99s Magellan, p. 303).\r\n\r\n[480] MS. 5,650 adds: \xe2\x80\x9chearing that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[481] In Eden: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc5\xbfixe hundreth and fiftie.\xe2\x80\x9d The native name of\r\nGilolo is Bato-tsima (also called Almahera), and the island belongs to\r\nthe Netherlands, being included in the residency of Ternate.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
