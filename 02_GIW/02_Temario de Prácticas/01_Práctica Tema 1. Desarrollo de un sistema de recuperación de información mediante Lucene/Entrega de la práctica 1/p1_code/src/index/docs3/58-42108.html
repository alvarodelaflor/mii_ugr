<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Slang, like everything else, changes much in the
course of time; and though but fifteen years
have elapsed since this Dictionary was first introduced
to the public, alterations have since then been many and
frequent in the subject of which it treats. The first issue
of a work of this kind is, too, ever beset with difficulties,
and the compiler was always aware that, though
under the circumstances of its production the book
was an undoubted success, it necessarily lacked many
of the elements which would make that success lasting,
and cause the “Slang Dictionary” to be regarded as an
authority and a work of reference not merely among
the uneducated, but among people of cultivated tastes
and inquiring minds. For though the vulgar use of
the word Slang applies to those words only which are
used by the dangerous classes and the lowest grades of
society, the term has in reality, and should have&mdash;as
every one who has ever studied the subject knows&mdash;a
much wider significance. Bearing this in mind, the
original publisher of this Dictionary lost no opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of obtaining information of a useful kind, which could
hardly find place in any other book of reference, with
the intention of eventually bringing out an entirely new
edition, in which all former errors should be corrected
and all fresh meanings and new words find a place.
His intention always was to give those words which
are familiar to all conversant with our colloquialisms
and locutions, but which have hitherto been connected
with an unwritten tongue, a local habitation, and to
produce a book which, in its way, would be as useful to
students of philology, as well as to lovers of human
nature in all its phases, as any standard work in the
English language. The squeamishness which tries to
ignore the existence of slang fails signally, for not only
in the streets and the prisons, but at the bar, on the
bench, in the pulpit, and in the Houses of Parliament,
does slang make itself heard, and, as the shortest and
safest means to an end, understood too.</p>

<p>My predecessor, the original compiler, did not live to
see his wish become an actual fact; and, failing him,
it devolved upon me to undertake the task of revision
and addition. How far this has been accomplished,
the curious reader who is possessed of a copy of each
edition can best judge for himself by comparing any
couple of pages he may select. Of my own share in
the work I wish to say nothing, as I have mainly
benefited by the labours of others; but I may say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
that, when I undertook the position of editor of what,
with the smallest possible stretch of fancy, may now be
called a new book, I had no idea that the alteration
would be nearly so large or so manifest. However, as
the work is now done, it will best speak for itself,
and, as good wine needs no bush, I will leave it, in all
hope of their tenderness, to those readers who are best
qualified to say how the task has been consummated.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is but fair for me to thank, as
strongly as weak words will permit, those gentlemen
who have in various ways assisted me. To two of
them, who are well known in the world of literature,
and who have not only aided me with advice, but have
placed many new words and etymologies at my service,
I am under particular obligation. With this I beg to
subscribe myself, the reader’s most obedient servant,</p>

<h2>THE HISTORY OF CANT,<br />

<span class="small">OR THE</span><br />

SECRET LANGUAGE OF VAGABONDS.</h2>


<p>Cant and Slang are universal and world-wide. By their
means is often said in a sentence what would otherwise
take an hour to express. Nearly every nation on
the face of the globe, polite and barbarous, has its divisions
and subdivisions of various ranks of society. These
are necessarily of many kinds, stationary and wandering,
civilized and uncivilized, respectable and disreputable,&mdash;those
who have fixed abodes and avail themselves of the
refinements of civilization, and those who go from place
to place picking up a precarious livelihood by petty sales,
begging, or theft. This peculiarity is to be observed amongst
the heathen tribes of the southern hemisphere, as well
as in the oldest and most refined countries of Europe. In
South Africa, the naked and miserable Hottentots are pestered
by the still more abject <i>Sonquas</i>; and it may be some satisfaction
for us to know that our old enemies at the Cape, the
Kaffirs, are troubled with a tribe of rascals called <i>Fingoes</i>,&mdash;the
former term, we are informed by travellers, signifying
beggars, and the latter wanderers and outcasts. In South
America, and among the islands of the Pacific, matters are
pretty much the same. Sleek rascals, without much inclination
towards honesty, fatten, or rather fasten, like the insects in the
famous epigram, upon other rascals, who would be equally
sleek and fat but for their vagabond dependents. Luckily
for respectable persons, however, vagabonds, both at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and abroad, generally show certain outward peculiarities which
distinguish them from the great mass of law-abiding people
on whom they subsist. Observation shows that the wandering
races are remarkable for an abnormal development of the
bones of the face, as the jaws, cheek-bones, &amp;c., for high-crowned,
stubborn-shaped heads, quick, restless eyes,<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> and
hands nervously itching to be doing; for their love of gambling;
for sensuality of all kinds; and for their use of a <span class="smcap">Cant</span>
language with which to conceal their designs and plunderings.</p>

<p>The secret jargon, or rude speech, of the vagabonds who
hang upon the Hottentots is termed Cuze-cat. In Finland, the
fellows who steal seal-skins, pick the pockets of bear-skin overcoats,
and talk cant, are termed Lappes. In France, the secret
language of highwaymen, housebreakers, and pickpockets, is
named Argot. The brigands and more romantic rascals of
Spain term their private tongue Germania,<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> or Robbers’ Language.
Rothwälsch,<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> or foreign-beggar-talk, is synonymous with
cant and thieves’ talk in Germany. The vulgar dialect of Malta,
and the Scala towns of the Levant&mdash;imported into this country
and incorporated with English cant&mdash;is known as the Lingua
Franca, or bastard Italian. And the crowds of lazy beggars
that infest the streets of Naples and Rome, as well as the brigands
of Pompeii, use a secret language termed Gergo. In England,
as we all know, it is called Cant&mdash;often improperly Slang.</p>

<p>Most nations, then, possess each a tongue, or series of tongues
maybe, each based on the national language, by which not only
thieves, beggars, and other outcasts communicate, but which is
used more or less by all classes. There is hardly any community
in this country, hardly any profession, but has its slang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and proficiency in this is the greatest desideratum of an aspirant
to the pleasures of Society, or the honours of literature and
art. The formation of these secret tongues varies, of course,
with the circumstances surrounding the speakers. A writer in
<i>Notes and Queries</i> has well remarked that “the investigation of
the origin and principles of cant and slang language opens a
curious field of inquiry, replete with considerable interest to the
philologist and the philosopher. It affords a remarkable instance
of lingual contrivance, which, without the introduction of
much arbitrary matter, has developed a system of communicating
ideas, having all the advantages of a foreign language.”</p>

<p>“The terms Cant and Canting were probably derived from
chaunt and chaunting,&mdash;the whining tone, or modulation of voice
adopted by beggars, with intent to coax, wheedle, or cajole by
pretensions of wretchedness.”<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> For the origin of the other
application of the word Cant, pulpit hypocrisy, we are indebted
to the <i>Spectator</i>&mdash;“Cant is by some people derived from one
Andrew Cant, who, they say, was a Presbyterian minister in
some illiterate part of Scotland, who, by exercise and use, had
obtained the faculty, alias gift, of talking in the pulpit in such
a dialect that ’tis said he was understood by none but his own
congregation,&mdash;and not by all of them. Since Master Cant’s
time it has been understood in a larger sense, and signifies all
exclamations, whinings, unusual tones, and, in fine, all praying
and preaching like the unlearned of the Presbyterians.” This
anecdote is curious, though it is but fair to assume that the
preacher’s name was taken from his practice, rather than that
the practice was called after the preacher. As far as we are
concerned, however, in the present inquiry, Cant was derived
from chaunt, a beggar’s whine; “chaunting” being the recognised
term amongst beggars to this day for begging orations
and street whinings; and “chaunter,” a street talker and
tramp, is still the term used by strollers and patterers. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
race is, however, nearly obsolete. The use of the word Cant,
amongst beggars, must certainly have commenced at a very
early date, for we find “To cante, to speake,” in Harman’s list
of Rogues’ Words in the year 1566; and Harrison about the
same time,<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> in speaking of beggars and Gipsies, says, “they
have devised a language among themselves which they name
Canting, but others Pedlars’ Frenche.”</p>

<p>Now, the word Cant in its old sense, and Slang<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> in its
modern application, although used by good writers and persons
of education as synonyms, are in reality quite distinct and
separate terms. Cant, apart from religious hypocrisy, refers to
the old secret language of Gipsies, thieves, tramps, and beggars.
Slang represents that evanescent language, ever changing with
fashion and taste, which has principally come into vogue
during the last seventy or eighty years, spoken by persons in
every grade of life, rich and poor, honest and dishonest.<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>
Cant is old; Slang is always modern and ever changing. To
illustrate the difference: a thief in Cant language would term a
horse a “prancer” or a “prad;” while in Slang, a man of fashion
would speak of it as a “bit of blood,” a “spanker,” or a “neat
tit.” A handkerchief, too, would be a “billy,” a “fogle,” or a
“Kent rag,” in the secret language of low characters; whilst
amongst the modern folk who affect Slang, it would be called
a “stook,” a “wipe,” a “fogle,” or a “clout.” Cant was formed
for purposes of secrecy. Slang, though it has a tendency the
same way, is still often indulged in from a mild desire to appear
familiar with life, gaiety, town-humour, and the transient nicknames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and street jokes of the day. Both Cant and Slang, we
have before said, are often huddled together as synonyms;
but they are most certainly distinct, and as such should be
used.</p>

<p>To the Gipsies, beggars and thieves are in great measure
indebted for their Cant language. It is supposed that the
Gipsies originally landed in this country early in the reign of
Henry VIII. They were at first treated as conjurors and
magicians,&mdash;indeed, they were hailed by the populace with as
much applause as a company of English performers usually
receives on arriving in a distant colony. They came here with
all their old Eastern arts of palmistry and second-sight, with
their factitious power of doubling money by incantation and
burial,&mdash;shreds of pagan idolatry; and they brought with them,
also, the dishonesty of the lower-caste Orientals, and the
nomadic tastes they had acquired through centuries of wandering
over nearly the whole of the then known globe. They
possessed also a language quite distinct from anything that had
been heard in England up till their advent; they claimed the
title of Egyptians, and as such, when their thievish propensities
became a public nuisance, were cautioned and proscribed in a
royal proclamation by Henry VIII.<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> The Gipsies were not
long in the country before they found native imitators; and
indeed the imitation is much more frequently found nowadays,
in the ranks of the so-called Gipsies, than is the genuine article.
Vagabondism is peculiarly catching, and the idle, the vagrant,
and the criminal soon caught the idea from the Gipsies, and
learned from them to tramp, sleep under hedges and trees, tell
fortunes, and find lost property for a consideration&mdash;frequently,
as the saying runs, having found it themselves before it was
lost. They also learned the value and application of a secret
tongue; indeed, with the Gipsies came in all the accompaniments
of maunding and imposture, except thieving and begging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
which were well known in this country, and perhaps in every
other, long before visitors had an opportunity of teaching
them.</p>

<p>Harman, in 1566, wrote a singular, not to say droll, book,
entitled, <i>A Caveat for commen Cvrsetors, vulgarly called Vagabones,
newly augmented and inlarged</i>, wherein the history and
various descriptions of rogues and vagabonds are given, together
with their canting tongue. This book, the earliest of the kind,
gives the singular fact that within a dozen years after the landing
of the Gipsies, companies of English vagrants were formed,
places of meeting appointed, districts for plunder and begging
operations marked out, and rules agreed to for their common
management. In some cases Gipsies joined the English gangs;
in others, English vagrants joined the Gipsies. The fellowship
was found convenient and profitable, as both parties were aliens
to the laws and customs of the country, living in a great measure
in the open air, apart from the lawful public, and often
meeting each other on the same by-path, or in the same retired
valley; but seldom intermarrying or entirely adopting each
other’s habits. The common people, too, soon began to consider
them as of one family,&mdash;all rogues, and from Egypt. This
superstition must have been very firmly imbedded, for it is still
current. The secret language spoken by the Gipsies, principally
Hindoo, and extremely barbarous to English ears, was found
incomprehensible and very difficult to learn. The Gipsies
naturally found a similar difficulty with the English language.
A rude, rough, and singular, but under the circumstances not
unnatural, compromise was made, and a mixture of Gipsy, old
English, newly-coined words, and cribbings from any foreign,
and therefore secret, language, mixed and jumbled together,
formed what has ever since been known as the Canting Language,
or Pedlar’s French; or, during the past century, St.
Giles’s Greek.</p>

<p>Such was the origin of Cant; and in illustration of its
blending with the Gipsy or Cingari tongue, we are enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
give the accompanying list of Gipsy, and often Hindoo, words,
with, in many instances, their English representatives:&mdash;</p>

<p>[In those instances indicated by a (*), it is doubtful whether we are
indebted to the Gipsies for the terms. Dad, in Welsh, also signifies a
father. Cur is stated to be a mere term of reproach, like Dog, which
in all European languages has been applied in an abusive sense. Objections
may also be raised against Gad, Maund, and many other of these
parallels. We have, however, no wish to present them as infallible; our
idea is merely to call the reader’s attention to the undoubted similarity
between both the sound and the sense in most examples.]</p>

<p>Here, then, we have the remarkable fact of at least a few
words of pure Gipsy origin going the round of Europe, passing
into this country before the Reformation, and coming down to
us through numerous generations purely by the mouths of the
people. They have seldom been written or used in books,
and it is simply as vulgarisms that they have reached us. Only
a few are now Cant, and some are household words. The
word jockey, as applied to a dealer or rider of horses, came
from the Gipsy, and means in that language a whip. The
word, used as a verb, is an instance of modern slang grown
out of the ancient. Our standard dictionaries give, of course,
none but conjectural etymologies. Another word, bamboozle,
has been a sore difficulty with lexicographers. It is not in the
old dictionaries, although it is extensively used in familiar or
popular language for the last two centuries; and is, in fact, the
very kind of word that such writers as Swift, Butler, L’Estrange,
and Arbuthnot would pick out at once as a telling and most
serviceable term. It is, as we have seen, from the Gipsy; and
here we must state that it was Boucher who first drew attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to the fact, although in his remarks on the dusky tongue he
has made an evident mistake by concluding it to be identical
with its offspring, Cant. Other parallel instances, with but
slight variations from the old Gipsy meanings, might be mentioned;
but sufficient examples have been adduced to show
that Marsden, a great Oriental scholar in the last century,
when he declared before the Society of Antiquaries that the
Cant of English thieves and beggars had nothing to do with
the language spoken by the despised Gipsies, was in error.
Had the Gipsy tongue been analysed and committed to writing
three centuries ago, there is every probability that many scores
of words now in common use could be at once traced to its
source, having been adopted as our language has developed
towards its present shape through many varied paths. Instances
continually occur nowadays of street vulgarisms ascending to
the drawing-rooms of respectable society. Who, then, can
doubt that the Gipsy-vagabond alliance of three centuries ago
has contributed its quota of common words to popular
speech?</p>

<p>Thomas Moore, in a humorous little book, <i>Tom Crib’s
Memorial to Congress</i>, 1819, says, “The Gipsy language, with
the exception of such terms as relate to their own peculiar
customs, differs but little from the regular Flash or Cant language.”
But this was magnifying the importance of the
alliance. Moore, we should think, knew nothing of the Gipsy
tongue other than the few Cant words put into the mouths of
the beggars in Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>Comedy of the Beggar’s
Bush</i>, and Ben Jonson’s <i>Masque of the Gipsies Metamorphosed</i>,&mdash;hence
his confounding Cant with Gipsy speech, and appealing
to the Glossary of Cant for so-called “Gipsy” words at the end
of the <i>Life of Bamfylde Moore Carew</i>, to bear him out in his
assertion. Still his remark bears much truth, and proof of this
would have been found long ago if any scholar had taken the
trouble to examine the “barbarous jargon of Cant,” and to
have compared it with Gipsy speech. George Borrow, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<i>Account of the Gipsies in Spain</i>, thus eloquently concludes his
second volume; speaking of the connexion of the Gipsies with
Europeans, he says:&mdash;“Yet from this temporary association
were produced two results; European fraud became sharpened
by coming into contact with Asiatic craft; whilst European
tongues, by imperceptible degrees, became recruited with various
words (some of them wonderfully expressive), many of which
have long been stumbling-blocks to the philologist, who, whilst
stigmatizing them as words of mere vulgar invention, or of
unknown origin, has been far from dreaming that a little more
research or reflection would have proved their affinity to the
Sclavonic, Persian, or Romaic, or perhaps to the mysterious
object of his veneration, the Sanscrit, the sacred tongue of the
palm-covered regions of Ind; words originally introduced into
Europe by objects too miserable to occupy for a moment his
lettered attention&mdash;the despised denizens of the tents of
Roma.” These words might with very little alteration be
ascribed to the subject of which this volume is supposed&mdash;indeed
hoped&mdash;to be a handbook.</p>

<p>But the Gipsies, their speech, their character&mdash;bad enough,
as all the world testifies, but yet not devoid of redeeming
qualities&mdash;their history, and their religious belief, have been
totally disregarded, and their poor persons buffeted and jostled
about until it is a wonder that any trace of origin or national
speech remains. On the Continent they received better attention
at the hands of learned men. Their language was taken
down in writing and examined, their history was traced, and
their extraordinary customs and practice of living in the open
air, and eating raw, and often putrid meat, were explained.
They ate reptiles and told fortunes because they had learnt to
do so through their forefathers centuries back in Hindostan;
and they devoured carrion because the Hindoo proverb&mdash;“That
which God kills is better than that killed by man”<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a>&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
still in their remembrance. This is the sort of proverb, we
should imagine, that would hardly commend itself to any one
who had not an unnatural and ghoule-like tendency anxious for
full development. Grellman, a learned German, was their
principal historian, and to him, and those who have followed
him, we are almost entirely indebted for the little we know of
their language. The first European settlement of the Gipsies
was in the provinces adjoining the Danube, Moldau and
Theiss, where M. Cogalniceano, in his <i>Essai sur les Cigains de
la Moldo-Valachie</i>, estimates them at 200,000. Not a few of
our ancient and modern Cant and Slang terms are Wallachian
and Greek words, picked up by these wanderers from the East,
and added to their common stock.</p>

<p>Gipsy, then, started, and was partially merged into Cant;
and the old story told by Harrison and others, that the first inventor
of canting was hanged for his pains, would seem to be a
humorous invention, for jargon as it is, it was doubtless of
gradual formation, like all other languages or systems of speech.
Most of the modern Gipsies know the old Cant words as well
as their own tongue&mdash;or rather what remains of it. As Borrow
says, “The dialect of the English Gipsies is mixed with
English words.”<a name="Anchor-11" id="Anchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> Those of the tribe who frequent fairs, and
mix with English tramps, readily learn the new words, as they
are adopted by what Harman calls “the fraternity of vagabonds.”
Indeed, the old Cant is a common language to
the vagrants of many descriptions and every possible origin
who are scattered over the British Isles.</p>

<p>English Cant has its mutabilities like every other system of
speech, and is considerably altered since the first dictionary was
compiled by Harman in 1566. A great many words are unknown
in the present tramps’ and thieves’ vernacular. Some of
them, however, still bear their old definitions, while others
have adopted fresh meanings. “Abraham-man” is yet seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
our modern “sham Abraham,” or “play the old soldier”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
to feign sickness or distress. “Autum” is still a church or
chapel amongst Gipsies; and “beck,” a constable, is our
modern Cant and Slang “beak,” once a policeman, but now a
magistrate. “Bene,” or “bone,” stands for good in Seven Dials
and the back streets of Westminster; and “bowse” is our
modern “booze,” to drink or fuddle. A “bowsing ken” was the
old Cant term for a public-house; and “boozing ken,” in modern
Cant, has precisely the same meaning. There is little doubt,
though, that the pronunciations were always as they are now, so
far at least as these two instances are concerned. “Cassan”
is both old and modern Cant for cheese; the same may be said
of “chattes,” or “chatts,” the gallows. “Cofe,” or “cove,” is still
a vulgar synonym for a man. “Dudes” was Cant for clothes;
we now say “duds.” “Flag” is still a fourpenny-piece; and
“fylche” means to rob. “Ken” is a house, and “lick”
means to thrash; “prancer” is yet known amongst rogues as
a horse; and to “prig,” amongst high and low, is to steal.
Three centuries ago, if one beggar said anything disagreeable to
another, the person annoyed would say, “Stow you,” or hold
your peace; low people now say, “Stow it,” equivalent to “Be
quiet.” There is, so far as the Slang goes, no actual difference in
the use of these phrases, the variation being in the pronouns&mdash;in
fact, in the direction. “Trine” is still to hang; “wyn”
yet stands for a penny. And many other words, as will be seen
in the Dictionary, still retain their ancient meaning.</p>

<p>As specimens of those words which have altered their original
Cant signification, may be instanced “<a id="chete"></a>chete,” now written cheat.
“Chete” was in ancient Cant what <i>chop</i> is in the Canton-Chinese&mdash;an
almost inseparable adjunct. Everything was termed a
“chete,” and qualified by a substantive-adjective, which showed
what kind of a “chete” was meant; for instance, “crashing-chetes”
were teeth; a “moffling-chete,” was a napkin; a
“topping-chete,” was the gallows, and a “grunting-chete,” was
a pig. Cheat nowadays means to cozen or defraud, and lexicographers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have tortured etymology for an original&mdash;but without
success. <i>Escheats</i> and <i>escheatours</i> have been named, but with
great doubts; indeed, Stevens, the learned commentator on
Shakspeare, acknowledged that he “did not recollect to have
met with the word cheat in our ancient writers.”<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> Cheat,
to defraud, then, is no other than an old Cant term somewhat
altered in its meaning,<a name="Anchor-13" id="Anchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> and as such it should be described in
the next etymological dictionary. Another instance of a
change in the meaning of the old Cant, but the retention of
the word, is seen in “cly,” formerly to take or steal, now a
pocket; and with the remembrance of a certain class of low
characters, a curious connexion between the two meanings is
discovered. “Make” was a halfpenny: we now say “mag,”&mdash;“make”
being modern Cant for getting money by any possible
means, their apophthegm being&mdash;“Get money the best way you
can, but <i>make</i> it somehow.” “Milling” stood for stealing; it ultimately
became a pugilistic term, and then faded into nothingness,
“the cove wot loves a mill,” being a thing of the past.
“Nab” was a head,&mdash;low people now say “nob,” the former
meaning, in modern Cant, to steal or seize. “Pek” was meat,&mdash;we
still say “peckish,” when hungry. “Peckish” is though
more likely to be derived from the action of birds when eating,
as all slang has its origin in metaphor. “Prygges, dronken
Tinkers or beastly people,” as old Harman wrote, would scarcely
be understood now; a “prig,” in the 19th century, is a pickpocket
or thief. He is also a mean, contemptible little
“cuss,” who is not, as a rule, found in low life, but who
could be very well spared from that of the middle and upper
classes. “<a id="Quier"></a>Quier,” or “queer,” like cheat, was a very common
prefix, and meant bad or wicked,&mdash;it now means odd, curious,
or strange; but to the ancient Cant we are possibly indebted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for the word, which etymologists should remember.<a name="Anchor-14" id="Anchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> “Rome,”
or “rum,” formerly meant good, or of the first quality, and was
extensively used like cheat and queer,&mdash;indeed as an adjective
it was the opposite of the latter. “Rum” now means curious,
and is synonymous with queer; thus,&mdash;“rummy old bloke,” or
a “queer old man.” Here again we see the origin of an
every-day word, scouted by lexicographers and snubbed by
respectable persons, but still a word of frequent and popular
use. “Yannam” meant bread; “pannum” is the word now.
Other instances could be pointed out, but they will be observed
in the Dictionary.</p>

<div>
<p>Several words are entirely obsolete. “Alybbeg” no longer
means a bed, nor “askew” a cup. “Booget,”<a name="Anchor-15" id="Anchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a> nowadays,
would not be understood for a basket; neither would “gan”
pass current for mouth. “Fullams” was the old Cant term
for false or loaded dice, and although used by Shakspeare in
this sense, is now unknown and obsolete. Indeed, as Moore
somewhere remarks, the present Greeks of St. Giles’s themselves
would be thoroughly puzzled by many of the ancient
canting songs,&mdash;taking, for example, the first verse of an old
favourite&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Bing out, bien Morts, and toure and toure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bing out, bien Morts, and toure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all your duds are bing’d awast;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The bien cove hath the loure.”<a name="Anchor-16" id="Anchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But perhaps we cannot do better than present to the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
at once an entire copy of the first Canting Dictionary ever
compiled. As before mentioned, it was the work of one
Thomas Harman, who lived in the days of Queen Elizabeth.
Some writers have remarked that Decker<a name="Anchor-17" id="Anchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> was the first to
compile a dictionary of the vagabonds’ tongue; whilst Borrow<a name="Anchor-18" id="Anchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a>
and Moore stated that Richard Head performed that service
in his <i>Life of an English Rogue</i>, published in the year 1680.
All these statements are equally incorrect, for the first attempt
was made more than a century before the latter work was
issued. The quaint spelling and old-fashioned phraseology are
preserved, and the initiated will quickly recognise many vulgar
street words as old acquaintances dressed in antique garb.<a name="Anchor-19" id="Anchor-19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a></p>

<p>Turning attention more to the Cant of modern times, in connexion
with the old, it will be found that words have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
drawn into the thieves’ vocabulary from every conceivable
source. Hard or infrequent words, vulgarly termed “crack-jaw,”
or “jaw-breakers,” were very often used and considered as Cant
terms. And here it should be mentioned that at the present
day the most inconsistent and far-fetched terms are often used
for secret purposes, when they are known to be caviare to the
million. It is strange that such words as incongruous, insipid,
interloper, intriguing, indecorum, forestall, equip, hush, grapple,
&amp;c., &amp;c., were current Cant words a century and a half ago, if we
are to judge by the Dictionary of Canting Words at the end of
<i>Bacchus and Venus</i>,<a name="Anchor-20" id="Anchor-20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> 1737. It is but fair, however, to assume
that the compiler of the dictionary was but trading on the demand
for Cant phrases, and was humbugging his readers. The
terms are inserted not as jokes or squibs, but as selections from
the veritable pocket dictionaries of the Jack Sheppards and
Dick Turpins of the day. If they were safely used as unknown
and cabalistic terms amongst the commonalty, the fact would
form a very curious illustration of the ignorance of our poor ancestors;
but it would be unfair and, indeed, idiotic to assume
this without much stronger proof than the book in question gives
of itself.</p>

<p>Amongst those Cant words which have either altered their
meanings, or have become extinct, may be cited lady, formerly
the Cant for “a very crooked, deformed, and ill-shapen
woman;”<a name="Anchor-21" id="Anchor-21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> and Harman, “a pair of stocks, or a constable.” The
former is a pleasant piece of sarcasm, whilst the latter indicates
a singular method of revenge, or else of satire. Harman was
the first author who specially wrote against English vagabonds,
and for his trouble his name, we are told, became synonymous
with a pair of stocks, or a policeman of the olden time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the Gipsy element, we find that Cant abounds
in terms from foreign languages, and that it exhibits signs of a
growth similar to that of most recognised and completely-formed
tongues,&mdash;the gathering of words from foreign sources. In
the reign of Elizabeth and of King James I., several Dutch,
Flemish, and Spanish words were introduced by soldiers who
had served in the Low Countries and sailors who had returned
from the Spanish Main, who, like “mine ancient
Pistol,” were fond of garnishing their speech with outlandish
phrases. Many of these were soon picked up and
adopted by vagabonds and tramps in their Cant language.
The Anglo-Norman and the Anglo-Saxon, the Scotch, the
French, the Italian, and even the classic languages of ancient
Italy and Greece, besides the various provincial dialects of
England, have contributed to its list of words. Indeed, as has
been remarked, English Cant seems to be formed on the same
basis as the Argot of the French and the Roth-Sprach of the
Germans&mdash;partly metaphorical, and partly by the introduction
of such corrupted foreign terms as are likely to be unknown to
the society amid which the Cant speakers exist. Argot is the
London thieves’ word for their secret language; it is, of course,
from the French, but that matters not, so long as it is incomprehensible
to the police and the mob. “Booze,” or “bouse,” is
supposed to come from the Dutch <i>buysen</i>, though the word has
been in use in England for some hundreds of years. “Domine,”
a parson, is from the Spanish. “Donna and feeles,” a woman
and children, is from the Latin; and “don,” a clever fellow,
has been filched from the Lingua Franca, or bastard Italian,
although it sounds like an odd mixture of Spanish and French;
whilst “duds,” the vulgar term for clothes, may have been pilfered
either from the Gaelic or the Dutch. “Feele,” a daughter,
from the French; and “frow,” a girl or wife, from the German&mdash;are
common tramps’ terms. So are “gent,” silver, from the
French <i>argent</i>; and “vial,” a country town, also from the
French. “Horrid-horn,” a fool, is believed to be from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Erse; and “gloak,” a man, from the Scotch. As stated before,
the dictionary will supply numerous other instances.</p>

<p>The Celtic languages have contributed many Cant and
vulgar words to our popular vocabulary. These have come to
us through the Gaelic and Irish languages, so closely allied in
their material as to be merely dialects of a primitive common
tongue. This element may arise from the Celtic portion of our
population, which, from its position as slaves or servants to its
ancient conquerors, has contributed so largely to the lowest
class of the community, therefore to our Slang, provincial,
or colloquial words; or it may be an importation from Irish
immigrants, who have contributed their fair proportion to our
criminal stock.</p>

<p>There is one source, however, of secret street terms which in
the first edition of this work was entirely overlooked,&mdash;indeed,
it was unknown to the original compiler until pointed out by a
correspondent,&mdash;the Lingua Franca, or bastard Italian, spoken
at Genoa, Trieste, Malta, Constantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria,
and all Mediterranean seaport towns. The ingredients of this
imported Cant are, as its name denotes, many. Its foundation
is Italian, with a mixture of modern Greek, German (from the
Austrian ports), Spanish, Turkish, and French. It has been
introduced to the notice of the London wandering tribes by the
sailors, foreign and English, who trade to and from the Mediterranean
seaports, but it must not be confounded with the
mixture of Irish, English, and Italian spoken in neighbourhoods
like Saffron Hill and Leather Lane, which are thronged with
swarms of organ-grinders from all parts of Italy, and makers of
images from Rome and Florence,&mdash;all of whom, in these dense
thoroughfares, mingle with our lower orders. It would occupy
too much space here to give a list of the words used in either
of these Babel-like tongues, especially as the principal of them
are noted in the dictionary.</p>

<p>“There are several Hebrew terms in our Cant language,
obtained, it would appear, from the intercourse of the thieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with the Jew fences (receivers of stolen goods); many of the Cant
terms, again, are Sanscrit, got from the Gipsies; many Latin, got
by the beggars from the Catholic prayers before the Reformation;
and many again, Italian, got from the wandering musicians
and others; indeed, the showmen have but lately introduced a
number of Italian phrases into their Cant language.”<a name="Anchor-22" id="Anchor-22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> The
Hindostanee also contributes several words, and these have
been introduced by the Lascar sailors, who come over here in
the East Indiamen, and often lodge during their stay in the low
tramps’ houses at the East-end of London. Speaking of the
learned tongues, it may be mentioned that, precarious and
abandoned as the vagabonds’ existence is, many persons
of classical or refined education have from time to time joined
the nomadic ranks,&mdash;occasionally from inclination, as in the
popular instance of Bamfylde Moore Carew, but generally
through indiscretions, which involve pecuniary difficulty and loss
of character.<a name="Anchor-23" id="Anchor-23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> This will in some measure account for numerous
classical and learned words figuring as Cant terms in the vulgar
dictionary.</p>

<p>In the early part of the last century, when highwaymen and
footpads were plentiful, and when the dangerous classes were
in larger proportion to the bulk of the population than they are
now, a great many new words were added to the canting
vocabulary, whilst several old terms fell into disuse. “Cant,”
for instance, as applied to thieves’ talk, was supplanted by the
word “flash.” In the North of England the Cant employed
by tramps and thieves is known as “Gammy.” It is mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from the old Gipsy corrupted. In the large towns of Ireland
and Scotland this secret language is also spoken, with of
course additions peculiar to each locality. All those words
derived from “gammy” are inserted in the dictionary as from
the North country.</p>

<div><p>A singular feature, however, in vulgar language is the retention
and the revival of sterling old English words, long since
laid up in ancient manuscripts. Disraeli somewhere says, “The
purest source of neology is in the revival of old words”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Words that wise Bacon or brave Rawleigh spake;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>and Dr. Latham remarks that “the thieves of London are
the conservators of Anglo-Saxonisms.” A young gentleman
from Belgravia, who had lost his watch or his pocket-handkerchief,
would scarcely remark to his mamma that it had been
“boned”&mdash;yet “bone,” in old times, meant, amongst high
and low, to steal. And a young lady living in the precincts of
dingy but aristocratic Mayfair, although enraptured with a
Jenny Lind or a Ristori, would hardly think of turning back in
the box to inform papa that she (Ristori or Lind) “made no
‘bones’ of it”&mdash;yet the phrase was most respectable and well-to-do
before it met with a change of circumstances. Possibly
fashion, in its journey from east to west, left certain phrases
and metaphors behind, which being annexed by the newcomers,
sank gradually in the social scale until they ultimately passed
out of the written language altogether, and became “flash”
or Slang. “A ‘crack’ article,” however first-rate, would have
greatly displeased Dr. Johnson and Mr. Walker&mdash;yet both
crack, in the sense of excellent, and crack up, to boast or
praise, were not considered vulgarisms in the time of Henry
VIII. The former term is used frequently nowadays, as a kind of
polite and modified Slang&mdash;as a “crack” regiment, a “crack”
shot, &amp;c. “Dodge,” a cunning trick, is from the Anglo-Saxon;
and ancient nobles used to “get each other’s ‘dander’ up”
before appealing to their swords,&mdash;quite “flabbergasting” (also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a respectable old word) the half-score of lookers-on with the
thumps and cuts of their heavy weapons. “Gallivanting,”
waiting upon the ladies, was as polite in expression as in
action; whilst a clergyman at Paule’s Crosse thought nothing
of bidding a noisy hearer “hold his ‘gab,’” or “shut up his
‘gob.’” But then the essence of preaching was to indulge in
idiomatic phrases and colloquialisms&mdash;a practice now almost
peculiar to itinerant “ranters.” “Gadding,” roaming about in
an idle and vacant manner, was used in an old translation of
the Bible; and “to do anything ‘gingerly’” was to do it with
great care. Persons of modern affected tastes will be shocked
to know that the great Lord Bacon spoke of the lower part of a
man’s face as his “gills,” though the expression is not more
objectionable than the generality of metaphor, and is considerably
more respectable than many words admitted to the
genteel&mdash;we use the word advisedly&mdash;vocabulary.</p>

<p>Shakspeare also used many words which are now counted
dreadfully vulgar. “‘Clean’ gone,” in the sense of out of sight,
or entirely away; “you took me all ‘a-mort,’” or confounded
me; “it wont ‘fadge,’” or suit, are phrases taken at random
from the great dramatist’s works. These phrases are the natural
outcome of the poet’s truth to life in the characters he portrayed.
A London costermonger, or inhabitant of the streets,
instead of saying, “I’ll make him yield,” or “give in,” in a
fight or contest, would say, “I’ll make him ‘buckle’ under.”
Shakspeare in his <i>Henry the Fourth</i> (part ii. act i. scene 1),
has the word; and Mr. Halliwell, one of the greatest and most
industrious of living antiquaries, informs us that “the commentators
do not supply another example.” If Shakspeare was not
a pugilist, he certainly anticipated the terms of the prize-ring&mdash;or
they were respectable words before the prize-ring was
thought of&mdash;for he has “pay,” to beat or thrash, and “pepper,”
with a similar meaning; also “fancy,” in the sense of pets and
favourites,&mdash;pugilists are often termed “the ‘fancy.’” The
origin of the term, as applied to them, has, however, never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
satisfactorily decided, though Pierce Egan and others since his
time have speculated ingeniously on the subject. The Cant
word “prig,” from the Saxon <i>priccan</i>, to filch, is also Shakspearian;
so, indeed, is “piece,” a contemptuous term for a
young woman. Shakspeare was not the only vulgar dramatist
of his time. Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Brome, and
other play-writers, occasionally, and very naturally, put Cant
words into the mouths of their low characters, or employed old
words which have since degenerated into vulgarisms. “Crusty,”
poor tempered; “two of a kidney,” two of a sort; “lark,”
a piece of fun; “lug,” to pull; “bung,” to give or pass;
“pickle,” a sad plight; “frump,” to mock, are a few specimens
casually picked from the works of the old histrionic writers.</p>

<p>One old English mode of canting, simple enough, but
affected only by the most miserable impostors, was the inserting
a consonant betwixt each syllable; thus, taking <i>g</i>, “How do
you do?” would be “How<i>g</i> do<i>g</i> you<i>g</i> do<i>g</i>?” The name very
properly given to this disagreeable nonsense, we are informed
by Grose, was gibberish.</p>

<p>Another slang has been manufactured by transposing the
initial letters of words, so that a mutton chop becomes a
<i>ch</i>utton <i>m</i>op, and a pint of stout a <i>st</i>int of <i>p</i>out; but it is satisfactory
to know that it has gained no ground, as it is remarkable
for nothing so much as poverty of resource on the part of its
inventors. This is called “Marrowskying,” or “Medical Greek,”
from its use by medical students at the hospitals. Albert Smith
termed it the “Gower Street Dialect,” and referred to it occasionally
in his best-known works.</p>

<p>The “Language of Ziph,” it may be noted, is another rude
mode of disguising English, in use among the students at
Winchester College. Some notices of this method of conveying
secret information, with an extensive Glossary of the Words,
Phrases, Customs, &amp;c., peculiar to the College, may be found
in Mr. Mansfield’s <i>School Life at Winchester College</i>. It is
certainly too puerile a specimen of work to find place here.</p>

<h2>ACCOUNT<br />

<span class="small">OF THE</span><br />

HIEROGLYPHICS USED BY VAGABONDS.</h2>


<p>One of the most singular chapters in a history of vagabondism
would certainly be “An Account of the
Hieroglyphic Signs used by Tramps and Thieves,” and
it certainly would not be the least interesting. The reader
may be startled to know that, in addition to a secret language,
the wandering tribes of this country have private marks and
symbols with which to score their successes, failures, and advice
to succeeding beggars; in fact, there is no doubt that the
country is really dotted over with beggars’ finger-posts and
guide-stones. The subject was not long since brought under
the attention of the Government by Mr. Rawlinson.<a name="Anchor-24" id="Anchor-24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> “There
is,” he says in his report, “a sort of blackguards’ literature,
and the initiated understand each other by Slang [Cant] terms,
by pantomimic signs, and by hieroglyphics. The vagrant’s
mark may be seen in Havant, on corners of streets, on door-posts,
on house-steps. Simple as these chalk-lines appear,
they inform the succeeding vagrants of all they require to
know; and a few white scratches may say, ‘Be importunate,’
or ‘Pass on.’”</p>

<p>Another very curious account was taken from a provincial
newspaper, published in 1849, and forwarded to <i>Notes and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<i>Queries</i>,<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> under the head of Mendicant Freemasonry.
“Persons,” remarks the writer, “indiscreet enough to open
their purses to the relief of the beggar tribe, would do well to
take a readily-learned lesson as to the folly of that misguided
benevolence which encourages and perpetuates vagabondism.
Every door or passage is pregnant with instruction as to the
error committed by the patron of beggars; as the beggar-marks
show that a system of freemasonry is followed, by which
a beggar knows whether it will be worth his while to call into
a passage or knock at a door. Let any one examine the
entrances to the passages in any town, and there he will find
chalk marks, unintelligible to him, but significant enough to
beggars. If a thousand towns are examined, the same marks
will be found at every passage entrance. The passage mark is
a cypher with a twisted tail; in some cases the tail projects
into the passage, in others outwardly; thus seeming to indicate
whether the houses down the passage are worth calling at or
not. Almost every door has its marks; these are varied. In
some cases there is a cross on the brickwork, in others a
cypher; the figures <b>1, 2, 3</b> are also used. Every person may
for himself test the accuracy of these statements by the examination
of the brickwork near his own doorway&mdash;thus demonstrating
that mendicity is a regular trade, carried out upon a
system calculated to save time, and realize the largest profits.”
These remarks refer mainly to provincial towns, London
being looked upon as the tramps’ home, and therefore too
“fly” or experienced to be duped by such means. The title it
obtains, that of “the Start,” or first place in everything, is
significant of this.</p>

<p>Provincial residents, who are more likely to view the foregoing
extract with an eye of suspicion than are those who live
in a position to constantly watch for and profit by evidences
of the secret intercommunication indulged in by the dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
classes, should note, in favour of the extract given, how significant
is the practice of tramps and beggars calling in unfrequented
localities, and how obvious it is that they are directed
by a code of signals at once complete and imperious. It is bad
for a tramp who is discovered disobeying secret orders. He is
marked out and subjected to all kinds of annoyance by means
of decoy hieroglyphs, until his life becomes a burden to him,
and he is compelled to starve or&mdash;most horrible of alternatives&mdash;go
to work.</p>

<p>The only other notice of the hieroglyphs of vagabonds worth
remarking is in Mayhew’s <i>London Labour and the London Poor</i>.<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a>
Mayhew obtained his information from two tramps, who stated
that hawkers employ these signs as well as beggars. One tramp
thus described the method of “working”<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> a small town. “Two
hawkers (‘pals’<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a>) go together, but separate when they enter
a village, one taking one side of the road, and selling different
things, and so as to inform each other as to the character
of the people at whose houses they call, they chalk certain
marks on their door-posts.” Another informant stated that “if
a ‘patterer’<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> has been ‘crabbed’” (that is, offended by refusal
or exposure) “at any of the ‘cribs’” (houses), “he mostly
chalks a signal at or near the door.” These hawkers
were not of the ordinary, but of the tramp, class, who carried
goods more as a blind to their real designs than for the purposes
of sale. They, in fact, represented the worst kinds of the
two classes. The law has comparatively recently improved
these nondescript gentry off the face of the country, and the
hawker of the present day is generally a man more sinned
against than sinning.</p>

<p>Another use is also made of hieroglyphs. Charts of successful
begging neighbourhoods are rudely drawn, and symbolical
signs attached to each house to show whether benevolent or
adverse.<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> “In many cases there is over the kitchen mantelpiece”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of a tramps’ lodging-house “a map of the district,
dotted here and there with memorandums of failure or success.”
A correct <a href="#frontiss">facsimile</a> of one of these singular maps is
given in this book. It was obtained from the patterers and
tramps who supplied a great many words for this work, and
who were employed by the original publisher in collecting
Old Ballads, Christmas Carols, Dying Speeches, and Last
Lamentations, as materials for a <i>History of Popular Literature</i>.
The reader will, no doubt, be amused with the drawing. The
locality depicted is near Maidstone, in Kent; and it was
probably sketched by a wandering Screever<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> in payment for a
night’s lodging. The English practice of marking everything,
and scratching names on public property, extends itself to
the tribe of vagabonds. On the map, as may be seen in the
left-hand corner, some Traveller<a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> has drawn a favourite or
noted female, singularly nicknamed Three-quarter Sarah.
What were the peculiar accomplishments of this lady to
demand so uncommon a name, the reader will be at a loss to
discover; but a patterer says it probably refers to a shuffling
dance of that name, common in tramps’ lodging-houses, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which “&frac34; Sarah” may have been a proficient. Above her, three
beggars or hawkers have reckoned their day’s earnings,
amounting to 13s., and on the right a tolerably correct sketch
of a low hawker, or cadger, is drawn. “To Dover, the <i>nigh</i>
way,” is the exact phraseology; and “hup here,” a fair
specimen of the self-acquired education of the draughtsman.
No key or explanation to the hieroglyphs was given in the
original, because it would have been superfluous, when every
inmate of the lodging-house knew the marks from his cradle&mdash;or
rather his mother’s back.</p>

<div><p>Should there be no map, in most lodging-houses there is an
old man who is guide to every “walk” in the vicinity, and
who can tell on every round each house that is “good for a
cold tatur.” The hieroglyphs that are used are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tdl" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Hieroglyphs">
<tr><td><img src="images/sa.jpg" alt="cross" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>No good</b>; too poor, and know too much.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/sb.jpg" alt="semicircle plus cross" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>Stop</b>,&mdash;If you have what they want, they will buy. They are
pretty “fly” (knowing).</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/sc.jpg" alt="forked branch" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>Go in this direction</b>, it is better than the other road.
Nothing that way.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/sd.jpg" alt="diamond" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>Bone</b> (good). Safe for a “cold tatur,” if for nothing else.
“Cheese your patter” (don’t talk much) here.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/se.jpg" alt="triangle pointing down" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>Cooper’d</b> (spoilt), by too many tramps calling there.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/sf.jpg" alt="square" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>Gammy</b> (unfavourable), like to have you taken up. Mind the
dog.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/sg.jpg" alt="circle with dot" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>Flummuxed</b> (dangerous), sure of a month in “quod” (prison).</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/sh.jpg" alt="circle with cross" title="" class="symbol" /></td><td><b>Religious</b>, but tidy on the whole.</td></tr>
</table></div>
</div>

<p>Where did these signs come from? and when were they first
used? are questions which have been asked again and again,
and the answers have been many and various. Knowing the
character of the Gipsies, and ascertaining from a tramp that
they are well acquainted with the hieroglyphs, “and have been
as long ago as ever he could remember,” there is little fear of
being wrong in ascribing the invention to them. How strange
it would be if some modern Belzoni, or Champollion&mdash;say Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
George Smith, for instance&mdash;discovered in these beggars’ marks
traces of ancient Egyptian or Hindoo sign-writing!</p>

<p>That the Gipsies were in the habit of leaving memorials of
the road they had taken, and the successes that had befallen
them, is upon record. In an old book, <i>The Triumph of Wit</i>,
1724, there is a passage which appears to have been copied
from some older work, and it runs thus:&mdash;“The Gipsies set out
twice a year, and scatter all over England, each parcel having
their appointed stages, that they may not interfere, nor hinder
each other; and for that purpose, when they set forward in the
country, they stick up boughs in the way of divers kinds,
according as it is agreed among them, that one company may
know which way another is gone, and so take another road.”
The works of Hoyland and Borrow supply other instances.</p>

<p>It would be hardly fair to close this subject without drawing
attention to the extraordinary statement that, actually on the
threshold of the gibbet, the sign of the vagabond was to be
met with! “The murderer’s signal is even exhibited from the
gallows; as a red handkerchief held in the hand of the felon
about to be executed is a token that he dies without having
betrayed any professional secrets.”<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> Private executions have of
course rendered this custom obsolete, even if it ever existed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the first editions of this work were published, the
publishers have received from various parts of England
numerous evidences of the still active use of beggars’ marks
and mendicant hieroglyphs. One gentleman writes from
Great Yarmouth to say that, whilst residing in Norwich, he used
frequently to see them on the houses and street corners in the
suburbs. Another gentleman, a clergyman, states that he has
so far made himself acquainted with the meanings of the signs
employed, that by himself marking the characters <img src="images/sf.jpg" alt="square" title="" class="symbol" /> (gammy)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and <img src="images/sg.jpg" alt="circle with dot" title="" class="symbol" /> (flummuxed) on the gate-posts of his parsonage, he
enjoys a singular immunity from alms-seekers and cadgers on
the tramp. This hint may not be lost on many other sufferers
from importunate beggars, yet its publication may lead to the
introduction of a new code.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div><p>In a popular constable’s guide,<a name="Anchor-31" id="Anchor-31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> giving the practice of justices
in petty sessions, the following interesting paragraph is found,
corroborating what has just been said on the hieroglyphs used
by vagabonds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Gipsies follow their brethren by numerous marks, such as strewing
handfuls of grass in the daytime at a four lane or cross roads; the grass
being strewn down the road the gang have taken; also, by a cross being
made on the ground with a stick or knife&mdash;the longest end of the cross
denotes the route taken. In the night-time a cleft stick is placed in the
fence at the cross roads, with an arm pointing down the road their comrades
have taken. The marks are always placed on the left-hand side, so that
the stragglers can easily and readily find them.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>From the cleft stick here alluded to, we learn the origin and
use of <img src="images/sc.jpg" alt="forked branch" title="" class="symbol" />, the third hieroglyph in the vagabond’s private
list. And the extract also proves that the “rule of the road”
is the same with tramps as with that body which is morally less
but physically more dangerous, the London drivers.</p>

<h2>A SHORT HISTORY OF SLANG,<br />

<span class="small">OR</span><br />

THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF FAST LIFE.</h2>

<p>Slang is the language of street humour, of fast, high, and
low life. Cant, as was stated in the <a href="#Page_1">chapter</a> upon that
subject, is the vulgar language of secrecy. It must be admitted,
however, that within the past few years they have become
almost indivisible. They are both universal and ancient, and
appear to have been, with certain exceptions, the offspring of
gay, vulgar, or worthless persons in every part of the world at
every period of time. Indeed, if we are to believe implicitly the
saying of the wise man, that “there is nothing new under the
sun,” the “bloods” of buried Nineveh, with their knotty and
door-matty-looking beards, may have cracked Slang jokes on the
steps of Sennacherib’s palace; while the stocks and stones of
ancient Egypt, and the bricks of venerable and used-up
Babylon, may be covered with Slang hieroglyphs, which,
being perfectly unknown to modern antiquaries, have long been
stumbling-blocks to the philologist; so impossible is it at this
day to say what was then authorized, or what vulgar, language.
The only objection that can be raised to this idea is, that Slang
was, so far as can be discovered, traditional, and unwritten,
until the appearance of this volume, a state of things which accounts
for its many changes, and the doubtful orthography of even
its best known and most permanent forms. Slang is almost as
old as speech, and must date from the congregating together of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
people in cities. It is the result of crowding, and excitement,
and artificial life. We have traces of this as far as we can refer
back. Martial, the epigrammatist, is full of Slang. When an
uninvited guest accompanied his friend, the Slang of the day
styled him his “umbra;” when a man was trussed, neck and heels,
it called him jocosely “quadrupus.” Slang is nowadays very
often the only vehicle by which rodomontade may be avoided.
It is often full of the most pungent satire, and is always to the
point. Without point Slang has no <i>raison d’être</i>.</p>

<p>Old English Slang was coarser, and depended more upon
downright vulgarity than our modern Slang. It was a jesting
speech, or humorous indulgence for the thoughtless moment
or the drunken hour, and it acted as a vent-peg for a fit of
temper or irritability; but it did not interlard and permeate
every description of conversation as now. It was confined to
nicknames and improper subjects, and encroached but to a very
small extent upon the domain of authorized speech. Indeed,
it was exceedingly limited when compared with the vast territory
of Slang in such general favour and complete circulation at the
present day. Still, although not an extensive institution, as in
our time, Slang certainly did exist in this country centuries ago,
as we may see if we look down the page of any respectable
History of England. Cromwell was familiarly called “Old
Noll,”&mdash;in much the same way as Bonaparte was termed
“Boney,” and Wellington “Conkey” or “Nosey,” only a few
years ago.<a name="Anchor-32" id="Anchor-32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> His Legislature, too, was spoken of in a high-flavoured
way as the “Barebones” or “Rump” Parliament,
and his followers were nicknamed “Roundheads,” and the
peculiar religious sects of his protectorate were styled “Puritans”
and “Quakers.”<a name="Anchor-33" id="Anchor-33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> The Civil War pamphlets, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
satirical hits of the Cavaliers and the Commonwealth men, originated
numerous Slang words and vulgar similes in full use
at the present moment. Here is a field of inquiry for the
Philological Society, indeed a territory, for there are thirty
thousand of these partisan tracts. Later still, in the court
of Charles II., the naughty ladies and the gay lords, with
Rochester at their head, talked Slang; and very naughty Slang
it was too. Fops in those days, when “over head and ears”
in debt, and in continual fear of arrest, termed their enemies,
the bailiffs, “Philistines”<a name="Anchor-34" id="Anchor-34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> or “Moabites.” At a later period,
when collars were worn detached from shirts, in order to save
the expense of washing&mdash;an object, it would seem, with needy
“swells” in all ages&mdash;they obtained the name of “Jacobites.”
One-half of the coarse wit in Butler’s <i>Hudibras</i> lurks in the
vulgar words and phrases which he was so fond of employing.
These Slang phrases contained the marrow of his arguments
stripped of all superfluous matter, and they fell with ponderous
weight and terrible effect upon his opponents. They were
more homely and forcible than the mild and elegant sentences
of Cowley, and the people, therefore, hurrahed them,
and pronounced Butler one of themselves,&mdash;or, as we should
say, in a joyful moment, “a jolly good fellow.” Orator Henley
preached and prayed in Slang, and first charmed and then
ruled the dirty mobs in Lincoln’s Inn Fields by vulgarisms.
Burly Grose mentions Henley, with the remark that we owe a
great many Slang phrases to him, though even the worst Slang
was refinement itself compared with many of Henley’s most
studied oratorical utterances, which proves that the most blackguard
parts of a blackguard speech may be perfectly free from
either Slang or Cant. Swift, and old Sir Roger L’Estrange, and
Arbuthnot, were all fond of vulgar or Slang language; indeed,
we may see from a Slang word used by the latter how curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
is the gradual adoption of vulgar terms in our standard dictionaries.
The worthy doctor, in order to annihilate (or, as we
should say, with a fitting respect to the subject under consideration,
to “smash”) an opponent, thought proper on an occasion
to use the word “cabbage,” not in the ancient sense of a flatulent
vegetable of the kitchen-garden, but in the at once Slang sense
of purloining or cribbing. Johnson soon met with the word,
looked at it, examined it, weighed it, and shook his head, but
out of respect to a brother doctor inserted it in his dictionary,
labelling it, however, prominently “Cant;” whilst Walker and
Webster, years after, when all over England “to cabbage” was to
pilfer, placed the term in their dictionaries as an ancient and
very respectable word. Another Slang term, “gull,” to cheat, or
delude, sometimes varied to “gully,” is stated to be connected
with the Dean of St. Patrick’s. “Gull,” a dupe, or a fool, is often
used by our old dramatists, and is generally believed to have
given rise to the verb; but a curious little edition of <i>Bamfylde
Moore Carew</i>, published in 1827, says that “to gull,” or “gully,”
is derived from the well-known Gulliver, the hero of the
famous Travels. It may be from the phrase, “You can’t come
Gulliver over me,” in use while the popularity of the book was
hot. How crammed with Slang are the dramatic works of the
last century! The writers of the comedies and farces in those
days must have lived in the streets, and written their plays in
the public-houses, so filled are they with vulgarisms and
unauthorized words. The popular phrases, “I owe you one,”
“That’s one for his nob,” and “Keep moving, dad,” arose in
this way.<a name="Anchor-35" id="Anchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a> The second of these sayings was, doubtless, taken
from the card-table, for at cribbage the player who holds the
knave of the suit turned up counts “one for his nob,” and the
dealer who turns up a knave counts “two for his heels.” From
a dramatic point of view, the use of these phrases is perfectly
correct, as they were in constant use among the people supposed
to be represented by the author’s characters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In Mrs. Centlivre’s admirable comedy of <i>A Bold Stroke for
a Wife</i>, we see the origin of that popular phrase, the real
<a id="Simon_Pure_Int"></a>Simon Pure. Simon Pure is the Quaker name adopted by
Colonel Feignwell as a trick to obtain the hand of Mistress
Anne Lovely in marriage. The veritable Quaker, the “real
Simon Pure,” recommended by Aminadab Holdfast, of Bristol,
as a fit sojourner with Obadiah Prim, arrives at last, to the
discomfiture of the Colonel, who, to maintain his position and
gain time, concocts a letter in which the real Quaker is spoken
of as a housebreaker who had travelled in the “leather conveniency”
from Bristol, and adopted the garb and name of the
western Quaker in order to pass off as the “Real Simon Pure,”
but only for the purpose of robbing the house and cutting the
throat of the perplexed Obadiah. The scene in which the two
Simon Pures, the real and the counterfeit, meet, is one of the
best in the comedy.</p>

<p>Tom Brown, of “facetious memory,” as his friends were wont
to say, and Ned Ward, who wrote humorous books, and when
tired drew beer for his customers at his alehouse in Long
Acre,<a name="Anchor-36" id="Anchor-36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> were both great producers of Slang in the last century,
and to them we owe many popular current phrases and household
words.</p>

<p>Written Slang was checked, rather than advanced, by the
pens of Addison, Johnson, and Goldsmith; although Bee,
the bottle-holder and historiographer of the pugilistic band of
brothers in the youthful days of flat-nosed Tom Cribb, has
gravely stated that Johnson, when young and rakish, contributed
to an early volume of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> a few pages, by
way of specimen, of a slang dictionary, the result, Mr. Bee says,
“of his midnight ramblings!”<a name="Anchor-37" id="Anchor-37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> This statement is not only
improbable, but an investigation of the venerable magazine,
though strict and searching, produces no evidence in corroboration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of Mr. Bee. Goldsmith, even, certainly coined a few words
as occasion required, although as a rule his pen was pure
and graceful, and adverse to neologisms. The word “fudge,”
it has been stated, was first used by him in literary composition,
although it probably originated with one Captain Fudge, a
notorious fibber, nearly a century before. Street phrases, nicknames,
and vulgar words were continually being added to the
great stock of popular Slang up to the commencement of the present
century, when it received numerous additions from pugilism,
horse-racing, and “fast” life generally, which suddenly came
into great public favour, and was at its height in the latter part
of the reign of George III., and in the early days of the
Regency. Slang in those days was generally termed “flash”
language. It will thus be noted that the term “flash” has in
turn represented both Cant and Slang; now the word Slang
has become perfectly generic. So popular was “flash” with
the “bloods” of high life, that it constituted the best paying
literary capital for certain authors and dramatists. Pierce Egan
issued <i>Boxiana</i>, and <i>Life in London</i>, six portly octavo volumes,
crammed with Slang; and Moncrieff wrote the most popular
farce of the day, <i>Tom and Jerry</i> (adapted from the latter
work), which, to use newspaper Slang, “took the town by
storm,” and, with its then fashionable vulgarisms, made the
fortune of the old Adelphi Theatre, and was without exception
the most wonderful instance of a continuous theatrical run in
ancient or modern times. This also was brimful of Slang.
Other authors helped to popularize and extend Slang down to
our own time, and it has now taken a somewhat different turn,
dropping many of the Cant and old vulgar words, and assuming a
certain quaint and fashionable phraseology&mdash;familiar, utilitarian,
and jovial. There can be no doubt that common speech is
greatly influenced by fashion, fresh manners, and that general
change of ideas which steals over a people once in a generation.
But before proceeding further into the region of Slang, it will
be well to say something on the etymology of the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The word Slang is only mentioned by two lexicographers&mdash;Webster
and Ogilvie.<a name="Anchor-38" id="Anchor-38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a> Johnson, Walker, and the older compilers
of dictionaries give “slang” as the preterite of “sling,” but not
a word about Slang in the sense of low, vulgar, or unrecognised
language. The origin of the word has often been asked for in
literary journals and books, but only one man, until recently,
ever hazarded an etymology&mdash;Jonathan Bee.<a name="Anchor-39" id="Anchor-39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> With a recklessness
peculiar to ignorance, Bee stated that Slang was derived
from “the <i>slangs</i> or fetters worn by prisoners, having
acquired that name from the manner in which they were worn,
as they required a sling of string to keep them off the ground.”
Bee had just been nettled at Pierce Egan’s producing a new
edition of Grose’s <i>Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>, and was
determined to excel in a vulgar dictionary of his own, which
should be more racy, more pugilistic, and more original. How
far he succeeded in this latter particular, his ridiculous etymology
of Slang will show. Slang is not an English word; it is
the Gipsy term for their secret language, and its synonym is
Gibberish&mdash;another word which was believed to have had no
distinct origin.<a name="Anchor-40" id="Anchor-40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a> Grose&mdash;stout and burly Captain Grose&mdash;whom
we may characterize as the greatest antiquary, joker, and porter-drinker
of his day, was the first lexicographer to recognise the
word “Slang.” It occurs in his <i>Classical Dictionary of the
Vulgar Tongue</i>, of 1785, with the statement that it implies
“Cant or vulgar language.” Grose was a great favourite with
Burns, and so pleased him by his extensive powers of story-telling
and grog-imbibing, that the companionable and humour-loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Scotch bard wrote for his fat friend&mdash;or, to use his own
words, “the fine, fat, fodgel wight”&mdash;the immortal poem of
<i>Tam O’ Shanter</i>.</p>

<p>It is not worth while troubling the reader with a long account
of the transformation into an English term of the word Slang,
as it is easily seen how we obtained it. Hucksters and beggars
on tramp, or at fairs and races, associate and frequently join in
any rough enterprise with the Gipsies. The word would be
continually heard by them, and would in this manner soon become
part of their vocabulary,<a name="Anchor-41" id="Anchor-41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> and, when carried by “fast” or
vulgar fashionables from the society of thieves and low characters
to their own drawing-rooms, would as quickly become Slang,
and the representative term for all vulgar language. Modern
philologists give the word Slang as derived from the French
<i>langue</i>. This is, at all events, as likely as any other derivative.</p>

<p>Any sudden excitement or peculiar circumstance is quite sufficient
to originate and set going a score of Slang words. Nearly
every election or public agitation throws out offshoots of excitement,
or scintillations of humour in the shape of Slang terms&mdash;vulgar
at first, but at length adopted, if possessing sufficient hold
on the public mind, as semi-respectable from sheer force of
habit. There is scarcely a condition or calling in life that does
not possess its own peculiar Slang. The professions, legal and
medical, have each familiar and unauthorized terms for peculiar
circumstances and things, and it is quite certain that the clerical
calling, or “the cloth”&mdash;in itself a Slang term given at a time
when the laity were more distinguished by their gay dress
from the clergy than they are now&mdash;is not entirely free from
this peculiarity. Every workshop, warehouse, factory, and mill
throughout the country has its Slang, and so have the public
schools and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Slang constitutes the principal charm of a sailor’s “yarn;” and
our soldiers have in turn their peculiar nicknames and terms for
things and subjects, proper and improper. A writer in <i>Household
Words</i> (No. 183) has gone so far as to remark, that a person
“shall not read one single parliamentary debate, as reported in
a first-class newspaper, without meeting scores of Slang words,”
and “that from Mr. Speaker in his chair, to the Cabinet Ministers
whispering behind it&mdash;from mover to seconder, from true
blue Protectionist to extremest Radical&mdash;Mr. Barry’s New
House echoes and re-echoes with Slang.” This statement is
most worthy of notice, as showing how, with a very small sub-stratum
of fact, a plausible, though not the less gigantic, mis-statement
may be built up.</p>

<p>The universality of Slang is extraordinary. Let any person
for a short time narrowly examine the conversation of his
dearest and nearest friends, or even analyse his own supposed
correct talk, and he shall be amazed at the numerous unauthorized,
and what we can only call vulgar, words in constant
use. One peculiarity of the growth of Slang is the finding of
new meanings for old words. Take, for instance, the verbs “do,”
“cut,” “go,” and “take,” and see how they are used to express
fresh ideas, and then let us ask ourselves how is it possible
for a Frenchman or German, be he never so well educated, to
avoid continually blundering and floundering amongst our
little words when trying to make himself understood in an
ordinary conversation? He may have studied our language the
required time, and have gone through the usual amount of
“grinding,” and practised the common allotment of patience,
but all to no purpose as far as accuracy is concerned. As, however,
we do not make our language, nor for the matter of that
our Slang, for the convenience or inconvenience of foreigners,
we need not pursue this portion of the subject further. “Jabber”
and “hoax” were Slang and Cant terms in Swift’s time; so, indeed,
were “mob” and “sham.”<a name="Anchor-42" id="Anchor-42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> Words directly from the Latin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Greek, framed in accordance with the rules which govern the
construction of the language, are not Slang, but are good English,
if not Saxon,&mdash;a term, by the way, which is as much misused
as any unfortunate word that can be remembered just now.
Sound contributes many Slang words&mdash;a source that etymologists
frequently overlook. Nothing pleases an ignorant person so
much as a high-sounding term, “full of fury.” How melodious
and drum-like are those vulgar coruscations “rumbumptious,”
“slantingdicular,” “splendiferous,” “rumbustious,” and “ferricadouzer.”
What a “pull” the sharp-nosed lodging-house-keeper
thinks she has over her victims if she can but hurl such
testimonies of a liberal education at them when they are disputing
her charges, and threatening to “absquatulate!” In the
United States the vulgar-genteel even excel the poor “stuck-up”
Cockneys in their formation of a native fashionable language.
How charming to a refined ear are “abskize,” “catawampously,”
“exflunctify,” “obscute,” “keslosh,” “kesouse,” “keswollop,”
and “kewhollux!”<a name="Anchor-43" id="Anchor-43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> It must not be forgotten, however,
that a great many new “Americanisms” are perfectly unknown
in America, and in this respect they resemble the manners and
customs of our cousins as found in books, and in books only.
Vulgar words representing action and brisk movement often owe
their origin to sound, as has before been remarked. Mispronunciation,
too, is another great source of vulgar or Slang words,
and of this “ramshackle,” “shackly,” “nary-one” for neither
or neither one, “ottomy” or “atomy” for anatomy, “rench” for
rinse, are specimens. The commonalty dislike frequently-occurring
words difficult of pronunciation, and so we have the
street abridgments of “bimeby” for by-and-by, “caze” for because,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“gin” for given, “hankercher” for handkerchief, “ruma
tiz” for rheumatism, “backer” for tobacco, and many others,
not perhaps Slang, but certainly, all vulgarisms. Whately, in
his <i>Remains of Bishop Copleston</i>, has inserted a leaf from the
bishop’s note-book on the popular corruption of names, mentioning,
among others, “kickshaws,” as from the French <i>quelques
choses</i>; “beefeater,” the grotesque guardian of royalty in a
procession, and the envied devourer of enormous beefsteaks,
as but a vulgar pronunciation of the French <i>buffetier</i>, and
“George and Cannon,” the sign of a public-house, as nothing
but a corruption (although so soon!) of the popular premier of
the last generation, George Canning.<a name="Anchor-44" id="Anchor-44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> Literature has its Slang
terms; and the desire on the part of writers to say funny and
startling things in a novel and curious way contributes many
unauthorized words to the great stock of Slang.</p>

<div><p>Fashionable or Upper-class Slang is of several varieties.
There is the Belgravian, military and naval, parliamentary, dandy,
and the reunion and visiting Slang. English officers, civilians,
and their families, who have resided long in India, have contributed
many terms from the Hindostanee to our language.
Several of these, such as “chit,” a letter, and “tiffin,” lunch, are
fast losing their Slang character, and becoming regularly-recognised
English words. “Jungle,” as a term for a forest or
wilderness, is now an English phrase; a few years past, however,
it was merely the Hindostanee “junkul.” This, being a
perfectly legal transition, having no other recognised form, can
hardly be characterized as Slang. The extension of trade in
China, and the English settlement of Hong Kong, have introduced
among us several examples of Canton jargon, that
exceedingly curious Anglo-Chinese dialect spoken in the seaports
of the Celestial Empire. While these words have been
carried as it were into the families of the upper and middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
classes, persons in a humbler rank of life, through the sailors
and soldiers and Lascar and Chinese beggars that haunt the
metropolis, have also adopted many Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Chinese
phrases. As this dictionary would have been incomplete
without them, they are carefully recorded in its pages.
Concerning the Slang of the fashionable world, it has been
remarked that it is mostly imported from France; and that an
unmeaning gibberish of Gallicisms runs through English
fashionable conversation and fashionable novels, and accounts
of fashionable parties in the fashionable newspapers. Yet,
ludicrously enough, immediately the fashionable magnates of
England seize on any French idiom, the French themselves not
only universally abandon it to us, but positively repudiate it
altogether from their idiomatic vocabulary. If you were to
tell a well-bred Frenchman that such and such an aristocratic
marriage was on the <i>tapis</i>, he would stare with astonishment,
and look down on the carpet in the startled endeavour to find
a marriage in so unusual a place. If you were to talk to him
of the <i>beau monde</i>, he would imagine you meant the world
which God made, not half-a-dozen streets and squares between
Hyde Park Corner and Chelsea Bun House. The <i>thé dansant</i>
would be completely inexplicable to him. If you were to
point out to him the Dowager Lady Grimgriffin acting as
<i>chaperon</i> to Lady Amanda Creamville, he would imagine you
were referring to the <i>petit Chaperon rouge</i>&mdash;to little Red-Riding
Hood. He might just understand what was meant by <i>vis-à-vis</i>,
<i>entremets</i>, and some others of the flying horde of frivolous little
foreign slangisms hovering about fashionable cookery and
fashionable furniture; but three-fourths of them would seem to
him as barbarous French provincialisms, or, at best, but as
antiquated and obsolete expressions, picked out of the letters
of Mademoiselle Scuderi, or the tales of Crebillon “the younger.”
Servants, too, appropriate the scraps of French conversation
which fall from their masters’ guests at the dinner table, and
forthwith in the world of flunkeydom the word “know” is disused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and the lady’s-maid, in doubt on a particular point, asks
John whether or no he “saveys” it?<a name="Anchor-45" id="Anchor-45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> What, too, can be more
abominable than that heartless piece of fashionable newspaper
Slang, regularly employed when speaking of the successful
courtship of young people in the aristocratic world:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Marriage in High Life</span>.&mdash;We understand that a marriage is
<span class="smcap lowercase">ARRANGED</span> (!) betwixt the Lady, &amp;c. &amp;c., and the Honourable, &amp;c. &amp;c.</div></div>

<p>“Arranged!” Is that cold-blooded Smithfield or Mark Lane
term for a sale or a purchase the proper word to express the
hopeful, joyous, golden union of young and trustful hearts?
Possibly, though, the word is often used with a due regard to
facts, for marriages, especially amongst our upper classes, are
not always “made in heaven.” Which is the proper way to
pronounce the names of great people, and what the correct
authority? Lord Cowper, we are often assured, is Lord <i>Cooper</i>&mdash;on
this principle Lord Cowley would certainly be Lord
<i>Cooley</i>&mdash;and Mr. Carew, we are told, should be Mr. <i>Carey</i>,
Ponsonby should be <i>Punsunby</i>, Eyre should be <i>Aire</i>, Cholmondeley
should be <i>Chumley</i>, St. John <i>Sinjen</i>, Beauchamp
should be <i>Beachem</i>, Majoribanks <i>Marshbanks</i>, and Powell
should always be <i>Poel</i>. The pronunciation of proper names
has long been an anomaly in the conversation of the upper
classes of this country. Hodge and Podge, the clodhoppers of
Shakspeare’s time, talked in their mug-houses of the great
Lords <i>Darbie</i>, <i>Barkelie</i>, and <i>Bartie</i>. In Pall Mall and May
Fair these personages are spoken of in exactly the same
manner at the present day, whilst in the City, and amongst the
<i>middle</i> classes, we only hear of Derby, Berkeley, &amp;c.,&mdash;the correct
pronunciations, if the spelling is worth aught. It must not
be forgotten, however, that the pronunciation of the upper
classes, as regards the names of places just mentioned, is a
relic of old times when the orthography was different. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
middle-class man is satisfied to take matters the modern way,
but even he, when he wishes to be thought a swell, alters his
style. In fact, the old rule as to proper names being pronounced
according to individual taste, is, and ever will be, of
absolute necessity, not only as regards the upper and middle,
but the lower classes. A costermonger is ignorant of such a
place as Birmingham, but understands you in a moment if you
talk of <i><a id="Brummagem"></a>Brummagem</i>. Why do not Pall Mall exquisites join
with the costermongers in this pronunciation? It is the
ancient one.<a name="Anchor-46" id="Anchor-46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a></p>

<p><i>Parliamentary Slang</i>, excepting a few peculiar terms connected
with “<i>the</i> House” (scarcely Slang), is mainly composed
of fashionable, literary, and learned Slang. When members
get excited, and wish to be forcible, they are now and again,
but not very often, found guilty of vulgarisms, and then may be
not particular which of the street terms they select, providing
it carries, as good old Dr. South said, plenty of “wildfire” in
it. Lord Cairns when Sir Hugh, and a member of the Lower
House, spoke of “that homely but expressive phrase, ‘dodge.’”
Out of “the House,” several Slang terms are used in connexion
with Parliament or members of Parliament. If Lord Palmerston
was familiar by name to the tribes of the Caucasus and
Asia Minor as a great foreign diplomatist, when the name of
our Queen was unknown to the inhabitants of those parts&mdash;as
was once stated in the <i>Times</i>&mdash;it is worthy of remark that,
amongst the costers and the wild inhabitants of the streets, he
was at that time better known as “Pam.” The cabmen on
the “ranks” in Piccadilly have been often heard to call each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
other’s attention to the great leader of the Opposition in the
following expressive manner&mdash;“Hollo, there! de yer see old
‘Dizzy’ doing a stump?” A “plumper” is a single vote at an
election&mdash;not a “split-ticket;” and electors who had occupied
a house, no matter how small, and boiled a pot in it, thus
qualifying themselves for voting, used in the good old days to
be termed “potwallopers.” A quiet “walk over” is a re-election
without opposition and much cost; and is obtained from
the sporting vocabulary, in which the term is not Slang. A
“caucus” meeting refers to the private assembling of politicians
before an election, when candidates are chosen, and measures
of action agreed upon. The term comes from America, where
caucus means a meeting simply. A “job,” in political
phraseology, is a Government office or contract obtained by
secret influence or favouritism; and is not a whit more objectionable
in sound than is the nefarious proceeding offensive to
the sense of those who pay but do not participate. The <i>Times</i>
once spoke of “the patriotic member of Parliament ‘potted
out’ in a dusty little lodging somewhere about Bury Street.”
But then the <i>Times</i> was not always the mildly respectable high-class
paper it now is, as a reference to the columns devoted by
it to Macaulay’s official career will alone determine. These,
which appeared during the present reign, would be far below
the lowest journalistic taste nowadays; yet they are in keeping
with the rest of the political references made at that time by the
now austere and high-principled “leading journal.” The term
“quockerwodger,” although referring to a wooden toy figure
which jerks its limbs about when pulled by a string, has been
supplemented with a political meaning. A pseudo-politician,
whose strings of action are pulled by somebody else, is often
termed a “quockerwodger.” From an early period politics
and partyism have attracted unto themselves quaint Slang
terms. Horace Walpole quotes a party nickname of February,
1742, as a Slang word of the day:&mdash;“The Tories declare
against any further prosecution, if Tories there are, for now one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
hears of nothing but the ‘broad-bottom;’ it is the reigning
Cant word, and means the taking all parties and people,
indifferently, into the Ministry.” Thus “broad-bottom” in
those days was Slang for “coalition.” The term “rat,” too, in
allusion to rats deserting vessels about to sink, has long been
employed towards those turncoat politicians who change their
party for interest. Who that occasionally passes near the
Houses of Parliament has not often noticed stout or careful
M.P.’s walk briskly through the Hall, and on the kerb-stone in
front, with umbrella or walking-cane uplifted, shout to the cabmen
on the rank, “Four-wheeler!” The term is both useful
and expressive; but it is none the less Slang, though of a
better kind than “growler,” used to denominate the same kind
of vehicle, or “shoful,” the street term for a hansom cab.</p>

<p>Military Slang is on a par, and of a character, with dandy
Slang. Inconvenient friends, or elderly and lecturing relatives,
are pronounced “dreadful bores.” This affectionate term,
like most other Slang phrases which have their rise in a certain
section of society, has spread and become of general application.
Four-wheeled cabs are called “bounders;” and a
member of the Four-in-hand Club, driving to Epsom on the
Derby Day, would, using fashionable phraseology, speak of it
as “tooling his drag down to the Derby.” A vehicle, if not a
“drag” (or dwag), is a “trap,” or a “cask;” and if the “turn-out”
happens to be in other than a trim condition, it is
pronounced at once as not “down the road,” unless the critic
should prefer to characterize the equipage as “dickey.” Your
City swell would say it is not “up to the mark;” whilst the
costermonger would call it a “wery snide affair.” In the army
a barrack or military station is known as a “lobster-box;” to
“cram” for an examination is to “mug-up” (this same term
is much in vogue among actors, who regard mugging-up as one
of the fine arts of the profession); to reject from the examination
is to “spin;” and that part of the barrack occupied by
subalterns is frequently spoken of as the “rookery.” In dandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
or swell Slang, any celebrity, from the Poet-Laureate to the
Pope of Rome, is a “swell,”&mdash;“the old swell” now occupies
the place once held by the “guv’nor.” Wrinkled-faced old
professors, who hold dress and fashionable tailors in abhorrence,
are called “awful swells,”&mdash;if they happen to be very
learned or clever. In this upper-class Slang, a title is termed
a “handle;” trousers, “inexpressibles,” and bags, or “howling
bags,” when of a large pattern;&mdash;a superior appearance, or
anything above the common cut, is styled “extensive;” a four-wheeled
cab is called a “birdcage;” a dance, a “hop;” dining
at another man’s table, “sitting under his mahogany;” anything
flashy or showy, “loud;” the peculiar make or cut of a
coat, its “build;” full dress, “full fig;” wearing clothes which
represent the very extreme of fashion, “dressing to death;” a
dinner or supper party, a “spread;” a friend (or a “good
fellow”), a “trump;” a difficulty, a “screw loose;” and
everything that is unpleasant, “from bad sherry to a writ from
a tailor,” “jeuced infernal.” The phrase, “to send a man
to Coventry,” or permit no person “in the set” to speak to
him, although an ancient saying, must still be considered
Slang.</p>

<p>The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the great
public schools, are the hotbeds of fashionable Slang. Growing
boys and high-spirited young fellows detest restraint of all
kinds, and prefer making a dash at life in a Slang phraseology
of their own to all the set forms and syntactical rules of <i>Alma
Mater</i>. Many of the most expressive words in a common
chit-chat, or free-and-easy conversation, are old university vulgarisms.
“Cut,” in the sense of dropping an acquaintance, was
originally a Cambridge form of speech; and “hoax,” to deceive
or ridicule, we are informed by Grose, was many years since an
Oxford term. Among the words that fast society has borrowed
from our great scholastic&mdash;not establishments (they are sacred
to linendrapery and “gentlemanly assistants”)&mdash;institutions, is
found “crib,” a house or apartments; “dead men,” empty wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bottles; “drawing teeth,”<a name="Anchor-47" id="Anchor-47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a> wrenching off knockers,&mdash;an obsolete
amusement; “fizzing,” first-rate, or splendid; “governor,”
or “relieving-officer,” the general term for a male parent;
“plucked,” defeated or turned back, now altered to “plough;”
“quiz,” to scrutinize, or a prying old fellow; and “row,” a noisy
disturbance. The Slang words in use at Oxford and Cambridge
would alone fill a volume. As examples let us take “scout,”
which at Oxford refers to an undergraduate’s valet, whilst the
same menial at Cambridge is termed a “gyp,”&mdash;popularly derived
by the Cantabs from the Greek, γὺψ, a vulture; “skull,”
the head, or master, of a college; “battles,” the Oxford term
for rations, changed at Cambridge into “commons.” The term
“dickey,” a half-shirt, it is said, originated with the students of
Trinity College, Dublin, who at first styled it a “tommy,”
from the Greek τομὴ, a section,&mdash;the change from “tommy” to
“dickey” requires no explanation. “Crib,” a literal translation,
is now universal; “grind” refers to “working up” for an examination,
also to a walk or “constitutional;” “Hivite” is a
student of St. Begh’s (St. Bee’s) College, Cumberland; to
“japan,” in this Slang speech, is to ordain; “mortar board” is
a square college cap; “sim,” a student of a Methodistical turn&mdash;in
allusion to the Rev. Charles Simeon; “sloggers,” at Cambridge,
refers to the second division of race-boats, known at
Oxford as “torpids;” “sport” is to show or exhibit; “trotter”
is the jocose term for a tailor’s man who goes round for orders;
and “tufts” are privileged students who dine with the “dons,”
and are distinguished by golden tufts, or tassels, in their caps.
Hence we get the world-wide Slang term “tuft-hunter,” one
whose pride it is to be acquainted with scions of the nobility&mdash;a
sycophantic race unfortunately not confined to any particular
place or climate, nor peculiar to any age or either sex. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
are many terms in use at Oxford not known at Cambridge; and
such Slang names as “coach,” “gulf,” “harry-soph,” “poker,”
or “post-mortem,” common enough at Cambridge, are seldom
or never heard at the great sister University. For numerous
other examples of college Slang the reader is referred to the
Dictionary.</p>

<p>Religious Slang, strange as the compound may appear, exists
with other descriptions of vulgar speech at the present day.
<i>Punch</i>, in one of those half-humorous, half-serious articles,
once so characteristic of the wits engaged on that paper, who
were, as a rule, fond of lecturing any national abuse or
popular folly, remarked&mdash;“Slang has long since penetrated into
the Forum, and now we meet it in the Senate, and even the
pulpit itself is no longer free from its intrusion.” There is no
wish here, for one moment, to infer that the practice is general.
On the contrary, and in justice to the clergy, it must be said
that the principal disseminators of pure English throughout the
country are the ministers of our Established Church. Yet it
cannot be denied that a great deal of Slang phraseology
and expressive vulgarism have gradually crept into the very
pulpits which should give forth as pure speech as doctrine.
This is an error which, however, has only to be noticed, to be
cured.</p>

<p>Dean Conybeare, in his able “Essay on Church Parties,”<a name="Anchor-48" id="Anchor-48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a>
has noticed this addition of Slang to our pulpit speech. As
stated in his Essay, the practice appears to confine itself mainly
to the exaggerated forms of the High and Low Church&mdash;the
Tractarians and the “Recordites.”<a name="Anchor-49" id="Anchor-49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a> By way of illustration, the
Dean cites the evening parties, or social meetings, common
amongst the wealthier lay members of the Recordite churches,
where the principal topics discussed&mdash;one or more favourite
clergymen being present in a quasi-official manner&mdash;are “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
merits and demerits of different preachers, the approaching restoration
of the Jews, the date of the Millennium, the progress
of the ‘Tractarian heresy,’ and the anticipated ‘perversion’
of High Church neighbours.” These subjects are canvassed in
a dialect differing considerably from English, as the word is
generally understood. The terms “faithful,” “tainted,” “acceptable,”
“decided,” “legal,” and many others, are used in a sense
different from that given to any of them by the lexicographers.
We hear that Mr. A. has been more “owned” than Mr. B.; and
that Mr. C. has more “seals”<a name="Anchor-50" id="Anchor-50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> than Mr. D. Again, the word
“gracious” is invested with a meaning as extensive as that
attached by young ladies to nice. Thus, we hear of a “gracious
sermon,” a “gracious meeting,” a “gracious child,” and even a
“gracious whipping.” The word “dark” has also a new and
peculiar usage. It is applied to every person, book, or place
not impregnated with Recordite principles. A ludicrous misunderstanding
resulting from this phraseology is on record (this
is not a joke). “What did you mean,” said A. to B., “by telling
me that &mdash;&mdash; was such a very ‘dark’ village? I rode over
there to-day, and found the street particularly broad and cheerful,
and there is not a tree in the place.” “The gospel is not
preached there,” was B’s. laconic reply. The conclusion of
one of these singular evening parties is generally marked by
an “exposition”&mdash;an unseasonable sermon of nearly one hour’s
duration, circumscribed by no text, and delivered from the table
by one of the clerical visitors with a view to “improve the
occasion.” This same term, “improve the occasion,” is of
Slang slangy, and is so mouthed by Stigginses and Chadbands,
and their followers, that it has become peculiarly objectionable
to persons of broad views. In the Essay to which reference
has been made, the religious Slang terms for the two great
divisions of the Established Church receive some explanation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
The old-fashioned High Church party&mdash;rich and “stagnant,”
noted for its “sluggish mediocrity, hatred of zeal, dread of innovation,
abuse of Dissent, blundering and languid utterance”&mdash;is
called the “high and dry;” whilst the opposing division,
known as the Low Church&mdash;equally stagnant with the former,
but poorer, and more lazily inclined (from absence of education)
towards Dissent&mdash;receives the nickname of the “low and
slow.” These terms are among persons learned in the distinctions
shortened, in ordinary conversation, to the “dry” and the
“slow.” The Broad Church, or moderate division, is often
spoken of as the “broad and shallow.”</p>

<p>What can be more objectionable than the irreverent and
offensive manner in which many Dissenting ministers continually
pronounce the names of the Deity&mdash;God and Lord?
God, instead of pronouncing in the plain and beautiful simple
old English way, “G‑o‑d,” they drawl out into “Gorde” or
“Gaude;” and Lord, instead of speaking in the proper way,
they desecrate into “Loard” or “Loerd,”&mdash;lingering on the <i>u</i>,
or the <i>r</i>, as the case may be, until an honest hearer feels disgusted,
and almost inclined to run the gauntlet of beadles
and deacons, and pull the vulgar preacher from his pulpit. This
is, though a Christian impulse, hardly in accordance with
our modern times and tolerant habits. Many young preachers
strive hard to acquire this peculiar pronunciation, in imitation
of the older ministers. What, then, can more properly be called
Slang, or, indeed, the most objectionable of Slang, than this
studious endeavour to pronounce the most sacred names in a
uniformly vulgar and unbecoming manner? If the old-fashioned
preacher whistled Cant through his nose, the modern vulgar
reverend whines Slang from the more natural organ. These
vagaries of speech will, perhaps, by an apologist, be termed
“pulpit peculiarities,” and the writer may be impugned for
having dared to intermeddle with a subject that is or should
be removed from his criticisms. Honesty of purpose and
evident truthfulness of remark will, however, overcome the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
most virulent opposition. The terms used by the mob towards
the Church, however illiberal and satirically vulgar, are fairly
within the province of an inquiry such as the present. A
clergyman, in vulgar language, is spoken of as a “choker,” a
“cushion-thumper,” a “dominie,” an “earwig,” a “gospel-grinder,”
a “grey-coat parson;” a “spouter,” a “white-choker,”
or a “warming-pan rector,” if he only holds the living <i>pro
tempore</i>. If he is a lessee of the great tithes, “one in
ten;” or if spoken of by an Anglo-Indian, a “rook.” If a
Tractarian, his outer garment is rudely spoken of as a
“pygostole,” or “M. B. (mark of the beast) coat.” His profession
is termed “the cloth” (this item of Slang has been
already referred to), and his practice is called “tub-thumping.”
This latter term has of late years been almost peculiarly
confined to itinerant preachers. Should he belong to the Dissenting
body, he is probably styled a “pantiler,” or a “psalm
smiter,” or perhaps, a “<a id="swaddler"></a>swaddler.”<a name="Anchor-51" id="Anchor-51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a> His chapel, too, is spoken
of as a “schism shop.” A Roman Catholic is coarsely named
a “brisket-beater.”</p>

<p>Particular as lawyers generally are about the meanings of
words, they have not prevented an unauthorized phraseology
from arising, which may be termed legal Slang. So forcibly did
this truth impress a late writer, that he wrote in a popular
journal, “You may hear Slang every day in term from barristers
in their robes, at every mess-table, at every bar-mess, at every
college commons, and in every club dining-room.” Swift, in his
<i>Art of Polite Conversation</i> (p. 15), published a century and a
half ago, states that “vardi” was the Slang in his time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“verdict.” A few of the most common and well-known terms
used out of doors, with reference to legal matters, are “cook,”
to hash or make up a balance-sheet; “dipped,” mortgaged;
“dun” (from a famous writ or process-server named Dunn), to
solicit payment; “fullied,” to be “fully committed for trial;”
“land shark,” a sailor’s definition of a lawyer; “limb of the
law,” a milder term for the same “professional;” “monkey with
a long tail,” a mortgage; “mouthpiece,” the thief’s term for
his counsel; “to run through the ring,” to take advantage of
the Insolvency Act; “smash,” to become bankrupt; “snipe,”
an attorney with a long bill; and “whitewash,” to take the
benefit of the Insolvent Act. Comparatively recent legislation
has rendered many of these terms obsolete, and “in liquidation”
is now the most ominous sound a creditor can hear.
Lawyers, from their connexion with the police courts, and transactions
with persons in every grade of society, have ample
opportunities for acquiring street Slang, of which, in cross-questioning
and wrangling, they frequently avail themselves.</p>

<div><p>It has been said there exists a literary Slang, or the Slang of
Criticism&mdash;dramatic, artistic, and scientific. This is composed
of such words as “æsthetic,” “transcendental,” “the harmonies,”
“the unities,” a “myth;” such phrases as “an exquisite <i>morceau</i>
on the big drum,” a “scholarlike rendering of John the Baptist’s
great toe,” “keeping harmony,” “middle distance,” “aërial perspective,”
“delicate handling,” “nervous chiaroscuro,” and the
like. It is easy to find fault with this system of doing work, whilst
it is not easy to discover another at once so easily understood by
educated readers, and so satisfactory to artists themselves. Discretion
must, of course, always be used, in fact always is used
by the best writers, with regard to the quantity of technical
Slang an article will hold comfortably. Overdone mannerism
is always a mistake, and generally defeats its own end. Properly
used, these technicalities are allowable as the generous inflections
and bendings of a bountiful language, for the purpose
of expressing fresh phases of thought, and ideas not yet provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with representative words.<a name="Anchor-52" id="Anchor-52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> <i>Punch</i> often employs a
Slang term to give point to a joke, or humour to a line of satire.
In his best day he gave an original etymology of the schoolboy-ism
“slog.” “Slog,” said the classical and then clever <i>Punch</i>,
is derived from the Greek word “slogo,” to baste, to wallop, to
slaughter. To show his partiality to the subject, he once amused
his readers with two columns on Slang and Sanscrit, from which
the following is taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The allegory which pervades the conversation of all Eastern nations is
the foundation of Western Slang; and the increased number of students of
the Oriental languages, especially since Sanscrit and Arabic have been
made subjects for the Indian Civil Service examinations, may have contributed
to supply the English language with a large portion of its new dialect.
While, however, the spirit of allegory comes from the East, there is so great a
difference between the brevity of Western expression and the more cumbrous
diction of the Oriental, that the origin of a phrase becomes difficult to
trace. Thus, for instance, whilst the Turkish merchant might address his
friend somewhat as follows&mdash;‘That which seems good to my father is to his
servant as the perfumed breath of the west wind in the calm night of the
Arabian summer;’ the Western negotiator observes more briefly, ‘all
serene!’”<a name="Anchor-53" id="Anchor-53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a></p></div>

<p>But the vulgar term, “brick,” <i>Punch</i> remarks in illustration,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“must be allowed to be an exception, its Greek derivation being universally
admitted, corresponding so exactly as it does in its rectangular form
and compactness to the perfection of manhood, according to the views of
Plato and Simonides; but any deviation from the simple expression, in
which locality is indicated&mdash;as, for instance, ‘a genuine Bath’&mdash;decidedly
breathes the Oriental spirit.”</p></div></div>

<p>It is singular that what <i>Punch</i> says unwittingly and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
humour respecting the Slang expression “bosh,” should be
quite true. “Bosh,” remarks <i>Punch</i>, after speaking of it as belonging
to the stock of words pilfered from the Turks, “is one
whose innate force and beauty the slangographer is reluctantly
compelled to admit. It is the only word which seems a proper
appellation for a great deal which we are obliged to hear and to
read every day of our life.” “Bosh,” nonsense or stupidity,
is derived from the Gipsy and the Persian. The universality
of Slang is proved by its continual use in the pages of <i>Punch</i>.
Who ever thinks, unless belonging to a past generation, of asking
a friend to explain the stray vulgar words employed by the
<i>London Charivari</i>? Some of the jokes, though, might nowadays
be accompanied by explanatory notes, in similar style to that
adopted by youthful artists who write “a man,” “a horse,” &amp;c.,
when rather uncertain as to whether or not their efforts will
meet with due appreciation.</p>

<p>The <i>Athenæum</i>, the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and other kindred
“weeklies,” often indulge in Slang words when force of expression
or a little humour is desired, or when the various writers
wish to say something which is better said in Slang, or so-called
vulgar speech, than in the authorized language. Bartlett, the
compiler of the <i>Dictionary of Americanisms</i>, continually cites
the <i>Athenæum</i> as using Slang and vulgar expressions; but the
magazine the American refers to is not the literary journal of
the present day,&mdash;it was a smaller, and now defunct, “weekly.”
The present possessor of the classic title is, though, by no means
behindhand in its devotion to colloquialisms. Many other
highly respectable journals often use Slang words and phrases.
The <i>Times</i> (or, in Slang, the “Thunderer”) frequently employs
unauthorized terms; and, following a “leader”<a name="Anchor-54" id="Anchor-54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> of the purest
and most eloquent composition, may sometimes be seen another
“article”<a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> on a totally different subject, containing, perhaps, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
score or more of exceedingly questionable words. Among the
words and phrases which may be included under the head of
Literary Slang are, “balaam,” matter kept constantly in type
about monstrous productions of nature, to fill up spaces in
newspapers; “balaam-box,” the term given in <i>Blackwood</i> to
the repository for rejected articles; and “slate,” to pelt with
abuse, or “cut up” in a review. “He’s the fellow to slate a
piece” is often said of dramatic critics, especially of those who
through youth, inexperience, and the process of unnatural selection
which causes them to be critics, imagine that to abuse all
that is above their comprehension is to properly exercise the
critical faculty. This is, however, dangerous ground. The
Slang names given to newspapers are curious;&mdash;thus, the
<i>Morning Advertiser</i> is known as the “Tap-tub,” the “’Tizer,”
and was until recently the “Gin and Gospel Gazette.” The
<i>Morning Post</i> has obtained the suggestive sobriquet of “Jeames;”
whilst the <i>Morning Herald</i> was long caricatured as “Mrs.
Harris,” and the <i>Standard</i> as “Mrs. Gamp.”<a name="Anchor-55" id="Anchor-55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Stage</i>, of course, has its Slang&mdash;“both before and behind
the curtain,” as a journalist remarks. The stage-manager is
familiarly termed “daddy;” and an actor by profession, or a
“professional,” is called a “pro.” It is amusing at times to
hear a young actor&mdash;who struts about padded with copies of all
newspapers that have mentioned his name&mdash;talking, in a mixed
company, of the stage as <i>the</i> profession. This is after all but
natural, for to him “all the world’s a stage.” A man who is occasionally
hired at a trifling remuneration to come upon the stage
as one of a crowd, or when a number of actors are wanted to
give effect, is named a “supe,”&mdash;an abbreviation of “supernumerary.”
A “surf” is a third-rate actor, who frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
pursues another calling; and the band, or orchestra between
the pit and the stage, is generally spoken of as the “menagerie.”
A “ben” is a benefit; and “sal” is the Slang abbreviation of
“salary.” Should no money be forthcoming on the Saturday
night, it is said that the “ghost doesn’t walk;” or else the
statement goes abroad that there is “no treasury,” as though
the coffers themselves had departed. The travelling or provincial
theatricals, who perform in any large room that can be
rented in a country village, are called “barn-stormers.” A
“length” is forty-two lines of any dramatic composition; and
a “run” is the continuous term of a piece’s performance. A
“saddle” is the additional charge made by a manager to an
actor or actress upon his or her benefit night. To “mug up”
is to paint one’s face, or arrange the person, to represent a particular
character; to “corpse,” or to “stick,” is to balk, or put the
other actors out in their parts by forgetting yours. A performance
is spoken of as either a “gooser” or a “screamer,” should
it be a failure or a great success;&mdash;if the latter, it is not infrequently
termed a “hit.” To “goose” a performance is to hiss
it; and continued “goosing” generally ends, or did end before
managers refused to accept the verdict of audiences, in the
play or the players being “damned.” To “star it” is to perform
as the centre of attraction, with your name in large type,
and none but subordinates and indifferent actors in the same
performance. The expressive term “clap-trap,” high-sounding
nonsense, is nothing but an ancient theatrical term, and signified
a “trap” to catch a “clap” by way of applause. “Up amongst
the ‘gods,’” refers to being among the spectators in the gallery,&mdash;termed
in French Slang “paradis.”</p>

<p>There exists, too, in the great territory of vulgar speech what
may not inappropriately be termed Civic Slang. It consists of
mercantile and Stock Exchange terms, and the Slang of good
living and wealth. A turkey hung with sausages is facetiously
styled an “alderman in chains,”&mdash;a term which has spread from
the City and become general; and a half-crown, perhaps from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
its rotundity, is often termed an “alderman.” A “bear” is a
speculator on the Exchange; and a “bull,” although of an
opposite order, follows a like profession. There is something
very humorous and applicable in the Slang term “lame duck,”
a defaulter in stock-jobbing speculations. The allusion to his
“waddling out of the Alley,” as they say, is excellent. “Breaking
shins,” in City Slang, is borrowing money; a rotten or
unsound scheme is spoken of as “fishy;” “rigging the
market” means playing tricks with it; and “stag” was a
common term during the railway mania for a speculator without
capital, a seller of “scrip” in “Diddlesex Junction” and other
equally safe lines. At Tattersall’s a “monkey” is 500<i>l.</i>, and in
the City a “plum” is 100,000<i>l.</i>, and a “marygold” is one million
sterling. But before proceeding further in a sketch of the
different kinds of Slang, it may be as well to speak here of the
extraordinary number of Cant and Slang terms in use to represent
money&mdash;from farthings to bank-notes the value of fortunes.
Her Majesty’s coin, collectively or in the piece, is known by
more than one hundred and thirty distinct Slang words, from
the humble “brown” (a halfpenny) to “flimsies,” or “long-tailed
ones” (bank-notes).</p>

<p>“Money,” it has been well remarked, “the bare, simple word
itself, has a sonorous, significant ring in its sound,” and might
have sufficed, one would have imagined, for all ordinary purposes,
excepting, of course, those demanded by direct reference
to specific sums. But a vulgar or “fast” society has thought
differently; and so we have the Slang synonyms&mdash;“beans,”
“blunt” (<i>i.e.</i>, specie,&mdash;not soft or rags, bank-notes), “brads,”
“brass,” “bustle,” “coppers” (copper money, or mixed pence),
“chink,” “chinkers,” “chips,” “corks,” “dibbs,” “dinarly,”
“dimmock,” “dust,” “feathers,” “gent” (silver,&mdash;from argent),
“haddock” (a purse of money), “horse nails,” “huckster,”
“loaver,” “lour” (the oldest Cant term for money), “mopusses,”
“needful,” “nobbings” (money collected in a hat by street-performers),
“ochre” (gold), “pewter,” “palm oil,” “pieces,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
“posh,” “queen’s pictures,” “quids,” “rags” (bank-notes),
“ready,” or “ready gilt,” “redge” (gold), “rhino,” “rowdy,”
“shiners” (sovereigns), “skin” (a purse of money), “stiff”
(checks, or bills of acceptance), “stuff,” “stumpy,” “tin”
(silver), “wedge” (silver), and “yellow-boys” (sovereigns);&mdash;just
forty-three vulgar equivalents for the simple word money.
So attentive is Slang speech to financial matters, that there are
seven terms for bad, or “bogus,” coin (as our friends the
Americans call it): a “case” is a counterfeit five-shilling piece;
“half a case” represents half that sum; “grays” are halfpence
made specially for unfair gambling purposes; “queer-soft” is
counterfeit or lead coin; “schofel” refers to coated or spurious
coin; “sheen” is bad money of any description; and “sinkers”
bears the same and not inappropriate meaning. “Snide” is
now the generic term for all bad money, whether coined or in
notes; and “snide-pitching” or “schoful-tossing” is the term
in use among the professors of that pursuit for what is more
generally known as “smashing.” “Flying the kite,” or obtaining
money on bills and promissory-notes, is closely connected
with the allegorical expression of “raising the wind,” which is
a well-known phrase for procuring money by immediate sale,
pledging, or by a forced loan. In winter or in summer any
elderly gentleman who may have prospered in life is pronounced
“warm;” whilst an equivalent is immediately at hand in the
phrase “his pockets are well lined,” or “he is well breeched.”
Each separate piece of money has its own Slang term, and
often half a score of synonyms. To begin with that extremely
humble coin, a farthing: first we have “fadge,” then “fiddler;”
then “gig,” and lastly “quartereen.” A halfpenny is a “brown”
or a “madzer (pronounced ‘medzer’) saltee” (Cant), or a
“mag,” or a “posh,” or a “rap,”&mdash;whence the popular phrase,
“I don’t care a rap.” The useful and universal penny has for
Slang equivalents a “copper,” a “saltee” (Cant), and a “winn.”
Twopence is a “deuce,” and threepence is either “thrums” or
“thrups.” “Thrums” has a special peculiarity; for while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
“thrums-buskin” represents threepence-halfpenny, the term
“buskin” is not used in connexion with any other number of
pence. Fourpence, or a groat, may in vulgar speech be termed
a “bit,” a “flag,” or a “joey.” Sixpence is well represented in
street talk, and some of the slangisms are very comical&mdash;for
instance, “bandy,” “bender,” “cripple,” and “downer;” then
we have “buck,” “fye-b’ck,” “half a hog,” “kick” (thus “two
and a ‘kick,’” or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>), “lord of the manor,”<a name="Anchor-56" id="Anchor-56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a> “pig,” “pot”
(the price of a pot of ale&mdash;thus half-a-crown is a “five ‘pot’
piece”), “snid,” “sprat,” “sow’s baby,” “tanner,” “tester,”
“tizzy,”&mdash;seventeen vulgar words to one coin. Sevenpence being
an uncommon amount has only one Slang synonym, “setter.”
The same remark applies to eightpence and ninepence, the
former being only represented by “otter,” and the latter by the
Cant phrase “nobba-saltee.” Tenpence is “dacha-saltee,”
and elevenpence “dacha-one,”&mdash;both Cant expressions. It is
noticeable that coined pieces, and sums which from their smallness
or otherwise are mostly in use, receive a commensurate
amount of attention from promoters of Slang. One shilling
boasts eleven Slang equivalents; thus we have “beong,” “bob,”
“breaky-leg,” “deener,” “gen” (from the back Slang), “hog,”
“levy,” “peg,” “stag,” “teviss,” and “twelver.” One shilling
and sixpence is a “kye,” now and then an “eighteener.” It is
noticeable that so far the florin has escaped, and only receives
the shilling titles with the required numeral adjective prefixed.
Half-a-crown is known as an “alderman,” “half a bull,” “half
a wheel,” “half a tusheroon,” and a “madza (medzer)
caroon;” whilst a crown piece, or five shillings, may be called
either a “bull,” a “caroon,” a “cartwheel,” or a “coachwheel,”
or, more generally than either, a “wheel” or a “tusheroon.”
The word “dollar” is in general use among costermongers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
their customers, and signifies exactly five shillings. Any term
representing this amount “takes in two,” and represents the
half-crown by the addition of the usual prefix. The next advance
in Slang money is ten shillings, or half-a-sovereign, which may
be either pronounced as “half a bean,” “half a couter,” “a
madza poona,” “half a quid,” or “half a thick ’un.” A sovereign,
or twenty shillings, is a “bean,” “canary,” “couter,”
“foont,” “goldfinch,” “James” (from Jacobus), “poona,”
“portrait,” “quid,” “thick-un,” or “yellow-boy.” Guineas
are nearly obsolete, yet the terms “neds” and “half neds” are
still in use. Bank-notes are “flimsies,” “long-tailed ones,” or
“soft.” A “fin,” or a “finnuf,” is a five-pound note. Twenty-five
pounds is a “pony,” and a hundred a “century.” One
hundred pounds (or any other “round sum”), quietly handed
over as payment for services performed, is curiously termed “a
‘cool’ hundred.” Thus ends, with several necessary omissions,
this long list of Slang terms for the coins of the realm which,
for copiousness, it is not too much to say, is not equalled by
any other vulgar or unauthorized language in Europe.</p>

<p>The antiquity of many of these Slang names is remarkable.
“<a id="Winn"></a>Winn” was the vulgar term for a penny in the days of Queen
Elizabeth; and “tester,” a sixpence (formerly a shilling), was
the correct name in the days of Henry VIII. The reader, too,
will have remarked the frequency of animals’ names as Slang
terms for money. Little, as a modern writer has remarked,
do the persons using these phrases know of their remote and
somewhat classical origin, which may, indeed, be traced to a
period anterior to that when monarchs monopolized the surface
of coined money with their own images and superscriptions.
They are identical with the very name of money among
the early Romans, which was <i>pecunia</i>, from <i>pecus</i>, a flock. The
collections of coin-dealers amply show that the figure of a “hog”
was anciently placed on a small silver coin; and that that of
a “bull” decorated larger ones of the same metal. These coins
were frequently deeply crossed on the reverse; this was for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
convenience of easily breaking them into two or more pieces,
should the bargain for which they were employed require it, and
the parties making it had no smaller change handy to complete
the transaction. Thus we find that the “half bull” of
the itinerant street-seller, or “traveller,” so far from being
a phrase of modern invention, as is generally supposed, is in
point of fact referable to an era extremely remote. This remark
will safely apply to most descriptions of money; and it must
not be forgotten that farthing is but a corruption of fourthing,
or, literally, fourth part of a penny. The representative coin of
the realm was often in olden times made to break up,&mdash;but this
by the way. It is a reminder, however, that the word “smash,”
as used by the classes that speak Slang from motives other than
those of affectation, has nothing whatever to do with base coin,
as is generally supposed. It simply means to give change.
Thus:&mdash;“Can you smash a thick ’un for me?” means simply,
“Can you give me change for a sovereign?” We learn from
Erizzo, in his <i>Discorso</i>, a further illustration of the proverb
“that there is nothing new under the sun;” for he says that
the Roman boys at the time of Hadrian tossed up their coppers
and cried, “Head or ship;” of which tradition our “heads or
tails,” and “man or woman,” or “a tanner I heads ’em,” is
certainly a less refined version. We thence gather, however,
that the prow of a vessel would appear to have been the more
ordinary device of the reverse of the brass coin of that ancient
period. There are many other Cant words directly from a
classic source, as will be seen in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Shopkeepers’ Slang is perhaps the most offensive of all Slang,
though this is not intended to imply that shopkeepers are perhaps
the most offensive of people. This kind of Slang is not a
casual eyesore, as newspaper Slang, neither is it an occasional
discomfort to the ear, as in the case of some vulgar byword of
the street; but it is a perpetual nuisance, and stares you in the
face on tradesmen’s invoices, on labels in the shop-windows,
and placards on the hoardings, in posters against the house next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to your own&mdash;if it happen to be empty for a few weeks&mdash;and
in bills thrust into your hand, as you peaceably walk through
the streets. Under your door, and down your area, Slang handbills
are dropped by some “pushing” tradesman; and for the
thousandth time you are called upon to learn that an “alarming
sacrifice” is taking place in the next street; that prices are “down
again;” that, in consequence of some other tradesman not
“driving a roaring trade,” being in fact, “sold up,” and for
the time being a resident in “Burdon’s Hotel” (Whitecross-Street
Prison), the “pushing” tradesman wishes to sell out at
“awfully low prices,” to “the kind patrons, and numerous customers,”
&amp;c. &amp;c., “that have on every occasion,” &amp;c. &amp;c. These
are, though, very venial offenders compared with those ghouls,
the advertising undertakers, who employ boys, loaded with
ghastly little books, to follow up the parish doctor, and leave
their horrible wares wherever he calls. But what can be expected
of ignorant undertakers when a London newspaper of large circulation
actually takes out the death records from the <i>Times</i>, and
sends a circular to each address therein, informing the bereaved
persons that the “&mdash;&mdash;” charges so much per line for similar
notices, and that its circulation is most extensive? Surely the
typical “death-hunter,” hardened though he may be, is hardly
down to that level. In shopkeeping Slang any occupation
or calling is termed a “line,”&mdash;thus, the “building line.” A
tailor usurps to himself a good deal of Slang. Amongst operatives
he is called a “snip,” a “steel-bar driver,” a “cabbage
contractor,” or a “goose persuader;” by the world, a “ninth
part of a man;” and by the young collegian, or “fast” man, a
“sufferer.” If he takes army contracts, it is “sank work;” if
he is a “slop” tailor, he is a “springer up,” and his garments
are “blown together.” Perquisites with him are “spiffs,” and
remnants of cloth “peaking, or cabbage.” The per-centage he
allows to his assistants (or “counter jumpers”) on the sale of old-fashioned
articles is termed “tinge.” If he pays his workmen in
goods, or gives them tickets upon other tradesmen, with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he shares the profit, he is soon known as a “tommy master.” If
his business succeeds, it “takes;” if neglected, it becomes
“shaky,” and “goes to pot;” if he is deceived by a debtor (a
by no means unusual circumstance), he is “let in,” or, as it is
sometimes varied, “taken in.” It need scarcely be remarked
that any credit he may give is termed “tick.”</p>

<p>Operatives’ or workmen’s Slang, in quality, is but slightly removed
from tradesmen’s Slang. When belonging to the same
shop or factory, they “graft” there, and are “brother chips.”
Among printers the favourite term is “comps,”&mdash;not compositors,
though the same contraction is used for that word,&mdash;but companions,
whether so in actual fact, or as members of the same
“companionship.” A companionship is the number of men
engaged on any one work, and this is in turn reduced to “ship:”
sometimes it is a “’stab ship,” <i>i.e.</i>, paid by the week, therefore
on the establishment; sometimes it is “on the piece,” and anyhow
it is an extremely critical organization, so perhaps it would
be better to broaden the subject. Workmen generally dine at
“slap-bang shops,” and are often paid at “tommy shops.” At
the nearest “pub,” or public-house, they generally have a “score
chalked up” against them, which has to be “wiped off” regularly
on the Saturday night. This is often known as a “light.”
When credit is bad the “light” is said to be out. When out
of work, they describe themselves as being “out of collar.”
They term each other “flints” and “dungs,” if they are “society”
or “non-society” men. Their salary is a “screw,” and to be
discharged is to “get the sack,” varied by the expression “get
the bullet,” the connexion of which with discharge is obvious, as
the small lecturers&mdash;those at the Polytechnic for instance&mdash;say,
to the meanest capacity. When they quit work, they “knock
off;” and when out of employ, they ask if any “hands” are,
or any assistance is, wanted. “Fat” is the vulgar synonym
for perquisites; “elbow grease” signifies labour; and “Saint
Monday” is the favourite day of the week. Names of animals
figure plentifully in the workman’s vocabulary; thus we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“goose,” a tailor’s smoothing-iron; “sheep’s-foot,” an iron
hammer; “sow,” a receptacle for molten iron, whilst the metal
poured from it is termed “pig.” Many of the Slang terms for
money may have originally come from the workshop, thus&mdash;“brads,”
from the ironmonger; “chips,” from the carpenter;
“dust,” from the goldsmith; “feathers,” from the upholsterer;
“horse-nails,” from the farrier; “haddock,” from the fishmonger;
and “tanner and skin” from the leather-dresser.</p>

<p>If society, as has been remarked, is a sham, from the vulgar
foundation of commonalty to the crowning summit of royalty,
then do we perceive the justness of the remark in that most
peculiar of peculiarities, the Slang of makeshifts for oaths, and
sham exclamations for passion and temper. These apologies
for feeling are an addition to our vernacular, and though some
argue that they are a disgrace, for the reason that no man
should pretend to swear or curse who does not do so, it is some
satisfaction to know that they serve the purpose of reducing
the stock of national profanity. “You be blowed,” or “I’ll be
blowed if,” &amp;c., is an exclamation often heard in the streets.
“Blazes,” or “like blazes,” came probably from the army,
unless, indeed, it came from the original metaphor, afterwards
corrupted, to serve all turns, “to smoke like blazes.” “Blast,”
too, although in general vulgar use, may have had an engineering
or military origin, and the phrase, “I wish I may be
shot, if,” smacks much of powder. “Blow me tight” is a very
windy and common exclamation. The same may be said of
“strike me lucky,” “never trust me,” and “so help me Davy;”
the latter being evidently derived from the truer old phrase,
“I’ll take my Davy on’t”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, my affidavit, “Davy,” and sometimes
“Alfred Davy,” being a corruption of that word. “By
Golly,” “Gol darn it,” and “so help”&mdash;generally pronounced
“selp” or “swelp”&mdash;“me Bob,” are evident shams for profane
oaths. “Tarnation” is but a softening of damnation; and “od,”
whether used in “od drat it,” or “od’s blood,” is but an
apology for the name of the Deity. “Marry,” a term of asseveration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in common use, was originally, in Popish times, a mode
of swearing by the Virgin Mary;&mdash;so also “marrow-bones,” for
the knees. “I’ll bring him down upon his marrow-bones,”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
I’ll make him bend his knees as he does to the Virgin
Mary. The Irish phrase, “Bad scran to yer!” is equivalent to
wishing a person bad food. “I’m sniggered if you will,” and “I’m
jiggered,” are other mild forms of swearing among men fearful
of committing an open profanity, yet slily nibbling at the sin.
Maybe, some day one of these adventurers will meet with the
object of his desires, and then when fairly “jiggered,” whatever
it may ultimately turn out to be, it is to be hoped he will prove
a fearful example to all persons with the will, but not the pluck,
to swear fierce oaths. Both “deuce” and “dickens” are vulgar
old synonyms for the devil; and “zounds” is an abbreviation
of “God’s wounds,”&mdash;a very ancient oath.</p>

<p>In a casual survey of the territory of Slang, it is curious to
observe how well represented are the familiar wants and failings
of life. First, there is money, with one hundred and odd
Slang terms and synonyms; then comes drink, from small
beer to champagne; and next as a very natural sequence, intoxication,
and fuddlement generally, with some half a hundred
vulgar terms, graduating the scale of drunkenness, from a slight
inebriation to the soaky state which leads to the gutter, sometimes
to the stretcher, the station-house, the fine, and, most
terrible of all, the “caution.” The Slang synonyms for mild
intoxication are certainly very choice,&mdash;they are “beery,”
“bemused,” “boozy,” “bosky,” “buffy,” “corned,” “foggy,”
“fou,” “fresh,” “hazy,” “elevated,” “kisky,” “lushy,”
“moony,” “muggy,” “muzzy,” “on,” “screwed,” “stewed,”
“tight,” and “winey.” A higher or more intense state of
beastliness is represented by the expressions, “podgy,” “beargered,”
“blued,” “cut,” “primed,” “lumpy,” “ploughed,”
“muddled,” “obfuscated,” “swipey,” “three sheets in the wind,”
and “top-heavy.” But the climax of fuddlement is only obtained
when the “disguised” individual “can’t see a hole in a ladder,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
or when he is all “mops and brooms,” or “off his nut,” or with
his “main-brace well spliced,” or with the “sun in his eyes,”
or when he has “lapped the gutter,” and got the “gravel rash,”
or is on the “ran-tan,” or on the “ree-raw,” or when “sewed
up,” and regularly “scammered,”&mdash;then, and not till then, is he
entitled, in vulgar society, to the title of “lushington,” or recommended
to “put in the pin,” <i>i.e.</i>, the linch-pin, to keep his
legs steady.</p>

<h2><span class="small">THE</span><br />

<p><b>A 1</b>, first-rate, the very best; “she’s a prime girl, she is; she is A 1.”&mdash;<i>Sam

term in the United States; also at Liverpool and other English seaports.
Another, even more intensitive form is “first-class, letter A,

beyond that of being different from others.</p>

<p><b>Abigail</b>, a lady’s-maid; perhaps obtained from old comedies. Used in
an uncomplimentary sense. Some think the term is derived from
Abigail Hill (Mrs. Masham), lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne, and a
typical <span class="smcap lowercase">ABIGAIL</span> in the way of intrigue.</p>

<p><b>About Right</b>, “to do the thing <span class="smcap lowercase">ABOUT RIGHT</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, to do it properly,
soundly, correctly; “he guv it ’im <span class="smcap lowercase">ABOUT RIGHT</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, he beat him
severely.</p>

<div><p><b>Abraham-man</b>, a vagabond, such as were driven to beg about the
country after the dissolution of the monasteries.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bess">BESS O’ BEDLAM</a></span>,

<p>It appears to have been the practice in former days to allow certain
inmates of Bethlehem Hospital to have fixed days “to go begging:”
hence impostors were said to “<span class="smcap lowercase">SHAM ABRAHAM</span>” (the Abraham Ward
in Bedlam having for its inmates these mendicant lunatics) when they
pretended they were licensed beggars in behalf of the hospital.</p>

<div><p><b><a id="Abraham-sham"></a>Abraham-sham</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAM ABRAHAM</span>, to feign sickness or distress.
From <span class="smcap lowercase">ABRAHAM-MAN</span>, the <i>ancient Cant</i> term for a begging impostor,
or one who pretended to have been mad.&mdash;<i>Burton’s Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>, vol. i. p. 360. When Abraham Newland was Cashier to

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><b>Absquatulate</b>, to run away, or abscond; a hybrid <i>American</i> expression,
from the Latin <i>ab</i>, and “squat” to settle.</p>

<p><b>Acres</b>, a coward. From Bob Acres, in Sheridan’s <i>Rivals</i>.</p>

<p><b>Adam’s Ale</b>, water.&mdash;<i>English.</i> The <i>Scotch</i> term is <span class="smcap lowercase">ADAM’S WINE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Added to the List</b>, a euphuism current among sporting writers
implying that a horse has been gelded. As, “Sabinus has been
<span class="smcap lowercase">ADDED TO THE LIST</span>.” Another form of expression in reference to
this matter is that “the knife has been brought into requisition.”
“<span class="smcap lowercase">ADDED TO THE LIST</span>” is simply a contraction for “added to the list
of geldings in training.”</p>

<p><b>Addlepate</b>, a foolish fellow, a dullard.</p>

<p><b>Admiral of the Red</b>, a person whose very red face evinces a fondness
for strong potations.</p>

<p><b>Affygraphy.</b> “It fits to an <span class="smcap lowercase">AFFYGRAPHY</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, to a nicety&mdash;to a <i>T</i>.</p>

<p><b>Afternoon Farmer</b>, one who wastes his best opportunity, and drives
off the large end of his work to the little end of his time.</p>

<p><b>Against the Grain</b>, in opposition to the wish. “It went <span class="smcap lowercase">AGAINST
THE GRAIN</span> to do it, but I knew I must,” is a common expression.</p>

<p><b>Aggerawators</b> (corruption of <i>Aggravators</i>), the greasy locks of hair in
vogue among costermongers and other street folk, worn twisted from
the temple back towards the ear. They are also, from a supposed
resemblance in form, termed <span class="smcap lowercase">NEWGATE KNOCKERS</span>, and sometimes
<span class="smcap lowercase">NUMBER SIXES</span>. This style of adorning the head is, however, fast
dying out, and the everyday costermonger or street thief has his hair
cut like any one else. The yearly militia drill may have had a good
deal to do with this alteration.</p>

<p><b>Akeybo</b>, a slang phrase used in the following manner:&mdash;“He beats
<span class="smcap lowercase">AKEYBO</span>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">AKEYBO</span> beat the devil.”</p>

<p><b>Albertopolis</b>, a facetious appellation given by the Londoners to the
Kensington Gore district. Now obsolete.</p>

<p><b>Alderman</b>, a half-crown&mdash;possibly from its rotundity. Also a long
pipe.</p>

<p><b>Alderman</b>, a turkey; “<span class="smcap lowercase">ALDERMAN IN CHAINS</span>,” a turkey hung with
sausages.</p>

<p><b>All of a Hugh!</b> all on one side; falling with a thump; the word <span class="smcap lowercase">HUGH</span>
being pronounced with a grunt.&mdash;<i>Suffolk.</i></p>

<p><b>All my Eye</b>, a remark of incredulity made in reference to an improbable
story; condensation of “<span class="smcap lowercase">ALL MY EYE AND BETTY MARTIN</span>,” a vulgar
phrase constructed from the commencement of a Roman Catholic
prayer to St. Martin, “Oh, mihi, beate Martine,” which in common
with many another fell into discredit and ridicule after the Reformation.</p>

<p><b>All out</b>, by far;&mdash;“he was <span class="smcap lowercase">ALL OUT</span> the best of the lot.” <i>Old</i>&mdash;frequently

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><b>All-overish</b>, neither sick nor well; the premonitory symptoms of illness.
Also the feeling which comes over a man at a critical moment, say
just when he is about to “pop the question.” Sometimes this is
called, “feeling all over alike, and touching nowhere.”</p>

<p><b>All-rounder</b>, a shirt collar going all round the neck and meeting in
front. Once fashionable, but little worn now.</p>

<p><b>All Serene</b>, an ejaculation of acquiescence. Some years back a popular
street cry. With or without application to actual fact, the words <span class="smcap lowercase">ALL
SERENE</span> were bawled from morning to night without any reference to
the serenity of the unfortunate hearers.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Serene">SERENE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Alls</b>, tap-droppings, refuse spirits sold at a cheap rate in gin-palaces.</p>

<p><b>All There</b>, in strict fashion, first-rate, “up to the mark;” a vulgar
person would speak of a handsome, well-dressed woman as being
<span class="smcap lowercase">ALL THERE</span>. An artisan would use the same phrase to express the
capabilities of a skillful fellow-workman. Sometimes <span class="smcap lowercase">ALL THE WAY
THERE</span>. Always used as a term of encomium.</p>

<p><b>All to Pieces</b>, utterly, excessively; “he beat him <span class="smcap lowercase">ALL TO
PIECES</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, excelled or surpassed him exceedingly. Also a term
much in use among sporting men and expressing want of form, or
decadence. A boat’s crew are said to “go <span class="smcap lowercase">ALL TO PIECES</span>” when
they through distress lose their regularity. A woman is vulgarly
said to “fall to pieces,” or “tumble to pieces,” when she is confined.</p>

<p><b>All to Smash</b>, or “<span class="smcap lowercase">GONE ALL TO PIECES</span>,” bankrupt, ruined.</p>

<div><p><b>Almighty Dollar</b>, an <i>American</i> expression representing the manner
in which money is worshipped. Modernly introduced by Washington
Irving in 1837. The <i>idea</i> of this phrase is, however, far older than
the time of <i>Irving</i>. <i>Ben Jonson’s Epistle to Elizabeth, Countess of
Rutland</i>, commences thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Whilst that for which all virtue now is sold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And almost every vice, <i>almightie gold</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It seems almost obvious that the term must have been applied, not to
dollars certainly, but to money, long before the time of Irving.</p>
</div>

<p><b>American Tweezers</b>, an instrument used by an hotel-sneak which
nips the wards end of a key, and enables him to open a door from the
opposite side to that on which it has been locked.</p>

<p><b>Andrew Millar</b>, a ship of war.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Ain’t</b>, the vulgar abbreviation of “am not,” “are not,” or “is not.”</p>

<p><b>Anointed</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, eminent; used to express great rascality in any one;
“an <span class="smcap lowercase">ANOINTED</span> scoundrel,” king among scoundrels.&mdash;<i>Irish.</i></p>

<p><b>Anointing</b>, a good beating. A case for the application of salve.</p>

<p><b>Anonyma</b>, a lady of the <i>demi-monde</i>, or worse; a “pretty horsebreaker.”
<span class="smcap">Incognita</span> was the term at first. Product of the
squeamishness of the age which tries to thrust away fact by the use of
fine words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Antiscriptural</b>, oaths, foul language. Anything unfit for ordinary
society conversation.</p>

<p><b>Apartments to Let</b>, a term used in reference to one who has a somewhat
empty head. As, “He’s got <span class="smcap lowercase">APARTMENTS TO LET</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Apostle’s Grove</b>, the London district known as St. John’s Wood.
Also called <span class="smcap lowercase">GROVE OF THE EVANGELIST</span>.</p>

<p><b>Apostles</b>, <span class="smcap">The Twelve</span>, the last twelve names on the Poll, or “Ordinary
Degree” List at the Cambridge Examinations, when it was arranged
in order of merit, and not alphabetically, and in classes, as at present;
so called from their being <i>post alios</i>, after the others.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Poll">POLL</a></span>. The
last of all was called <span class="smcap">St. Paul</span> (or Saint Poll), as being the least of
the apostles, and “not meet to be called an apostle” (<i>see</i> 1 Cor. xv.
9). As in the “Honour” list (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Gulfed">Gulf</a></span>), students who had failed
only slightly in one or more subjects were occasionally allowed their
degrees, and these were termed <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Elegant_extracts">ELEGANT EXTRACTS</a></span>.&mdash;<i>Camb. Univ.
Slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Apple-pie Bed</b>, a trick played at schools on new comers, or on any
boy disliked by the rest. One of the sheets is removed, and the
other is doubled in the middle, so that both edges are brought to the
top, and look as if both sheets were there; but the unhappy occupant
is prevented getting more than half-way down, and he has to remake
his bed as best he can. This trick is sometimes played by children of
a larger growth.</p>

<p><b>Apple-Cart</b>, the human structure, so far as the phrases with which it is
connected are concerned. As “I’ll upset your <span class="smcap lowercase">APPLE-CART</span>,” “down
with his <span class="smcap lowercase">APPLE-CART</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Apple-pie Order</b>, in exact or very nice order.</p>

<p><b>Appro</b>, contraction of approbation, a word much in use among jewellers.
Most of the extensive show of chains, watches, and trinkets in a shop
window is obtained “<span class="smcap lowercase">ON APPRO</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, “on sale or return.”</p>

<p><b>Area Sneak</b>, a thief who commits depredations upon kitchens and
cellars.</p>

<p><b>Argol-bargol</b>, to bandy words.&mdash;<i>Scotch.</i></p>

<p><b>Article</b>, derisive term for a weak or insignificant specimen of humanity.</p>

<p><b>Atomy</b>, a diminutive or deformed person. From <span class="smcap lowercase">ANATOMY</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">ATOM</span>.</p>

<p><b>Attack</b>, to carve, or commence operations; “<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTACK</span> that beef, and
oblige!”</p>

<p><b>Attic</b>, the head; “queer in the <span class="smcap lowercase">ATTIC</span>,” intoxicated or weak-minded.
Sometimes <span class="smcap lowercase">ATTIC</span> is varied by “upper story.”</p>

<p><b>Attic Salt</b>, wit, humour, pleasantry. Partly a reference to a suggestive
portion of Grecian literature, and partly a sly hit at the well-known
poverty of many writers.</p>

<p><b>Auctioneer</b>, to “tip him the <span class="smcap lowercase">AUCTIONEER</span>,” is to knock a man down. Tom
Sayers’s right hand was known to pugilistic fame as the <span class="smcap lowercase">AUCTIONEER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Audit Ale</b>, extra strong ale supposed to be drunk when the accounts
are audited.&mdash;<i>Camb. Univ.</i></p>

<p><b>Auld-Reekie</b>, an affectionate term for the old town of Edinburgh.
Derived from its dingy appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Aunt Sally</b>, a favourite figure on racecourses and at fairs, consisting of a
wooden head mounted on a stick, firmly fixed in the ground; in the
nose of which, or rather where the nose should be, a tobacco-pipe is
inserted. The fun consists in standing at a distance and demolishing
<span class="smcap lowercase">AUNT SALLY’S</span> pipe-clay projection with short bludgeons, very
similar to the halves of broom-handles. The Duke of Beaufort is a
“crack hand” at smashing pipe noses; and his performances some
years ago on Brighton racecourse, which brought the game into
notoriety, are yet fresh in remembrance. <span class="smcap">Aunt Sally</span> has, however,
had her day, and once again the inevitable “three shies a penny!” is
chief among our outdoor amusements.</p>

<p><b>Avast</b>, a sailor’s phrase for stop, shut up, go away,&mdash;apparently connected
with the <i>old Cant</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BYNGE A WASTE</span>; or from the <i>Italian</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BASTA</span>, hold! enough.</p>

<p><b>Awake</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FLY</span>, knowing, thoroughly understanding. “I’m awake,”
<i>i.e.</i>, I know all. The phrase <span class="smcap lowercase">WIDE-AWAKE</span> carries a similar
meaning in ordinary conversation, but has a more general reference.</p>

<p><b>Awful</b>, a senseless expletive, used to intensify a description of anything
good or bad; “what an <span class="smcap lowercase">AWFUL</span> fine woman!” “awfully jolly,”
“awfully sorry,” &amp;c. The phrase is not confined to any section of
society.</p>

<p><b>Ax</b>, to ask. Sometimes pronounced arks.</p>

<div class="section">

<p><b>Babes</b>, the lowest order of <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Knock-outs">KNOCK-OUTS</a></span> (which <i>see</i>), who are prevailed
upon not to give opposing biddings at auctions, in consideration of
their receiving a small sum (from one shilling to half-a-crown), and a
certain quantity of beer. They can, however, even after this agreement,
be secured on the other side for a little longer price. There is no
honour among thieves&mdash;at all events not among auction thieves&mdash;nowadays.</p>

<p><b><a id="Back2"></a>Back</b>, to support by means of money, on the turf or otherwise.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Lay">LAY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Back"></a>Back</b>, “to get one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">BACK UP</span>,” to annoy or enrage. Probably from the
action of a cat when preparing to give battle to an enemy.</p>

<p><b>Back-end</b>, that portion of the year which commences with October.
This phrase is peculiar to the turf, and has its origin in the fact that
October was actually, and is now nearly, the finishing portion of the
racing season. Towards <span class="smcap lowercase">BACK-END</span> the punters and “little men” generally
begin to look forward with anxiety to their winter prospects, and
“going for the gloves” is not only a frequent phrase, but a frequently
recurring practice.</p>

<p><b>Back Out</b>, to retreat from a difficulty; reverse of <span class="smcap lowercase">GO AHEAD</span>. Metaphor
borrowed from the stables.</p>

<p><b>Back Slang It</b>, to go out the back way. Equivalent to “Sling your
hook out of the back-door,” <i>i.e.</i>, get away quickly.</p>

<p><b>Backslums</b>, the byeways and disreputable portions of a town.</p>

<p><b>Back-Hander</b>, a blow on the face with the back of the hand, a back-handed
tip. Also a drink out of turn, as when a greedy person delays
the decanter to get a second glass. Anything done slyly or secretly
is said to be done in a back-handed manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Backer</b>, one who places his money on a particular man or animal; a
supporter of one side in a contest. The great body of betting men is
divided into <span class="smcap lowercase">BOOKMAKERS</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">BACKERS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Back Jump</b>, a back window.&mdash;<i>Prison term.</i></p>

<p><b>Bacon</b>, the body, “to save one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">BACON</span>,” to escape.</p>

<p><b>Bad</b>, “to go to the bad,” to deteriorate in character, to be ruined. <i>Virgil</i>
has an almost similar phrase, <i>in pejus ruere</i>, which means, by the way,
to go to the worse.</p>

<p><b>Bad</b>, hard, difficult. Word in use among sporting men who say, “He
will be <span class="smcap lowercase">BAD</span> to beat,” when they mean that the man or horse to whom
they refer will about win.</p>

<p><b>Bad Egg</b>, a scoundrel or rascal.</p>

<p><b>Badger</b>, to tease, to annoy by “chaffing.” Suggestive of drawing a
badger.</p>

<p><b>Bad Lot</b>, a term derived from auctioneering slang, and now generally
used to describe a man or woman of indifferent morals.</p>

<p><b><a id="Badminton"></a>Badminton</b>, blood,&mdash;properly a peculiar kind of claret-cup invented at
the Duke of Beaufort’s seat of that name. <span class="smcap">Badminton</span> proper is
made of claret, sugar, spice, cucumber peel, and ice, and was sometimes
used by the patrons of the Prize Ring as a synonym for blood.</p>

<p><b>Bad Words</b>, words not always bad of themselves but unpleasant to
“ears polite,” from their vulgar associations.</p>

<p><b>Baffaty</b>, calico. Term used in the drapery trade.</p>

<p><b>Bag</b>, to seize or steal, equivalent to “collar.”</p>

<p><b>Bagman</b>, a commercial traveller. This word is used more in reference to
the old style of commercial travellers than to the present.</p>

<p><b><a id="Bags"></a>Bags</b>, trousers. Trousers of an extensive pattern, or exaggerated fashion,
have sometimes been termed <span class="smcap lowercase">HOWLING-BAGS</span>, but only when the style
has been very “loud.” The word is probably an abbreviation of
bumbags. “To have the <span class="smcap lowercase">BAGS</span> off,” to be of age and one’s own
master, to have plenty of money. <span class="smcap">Bags of mystery</span> is another
phrase in frequent use, and refers to sausages and saveloys. <span class="smcap">Bag of
tricks</span>, refers to the whole of a means towards a result. “That’s
the whole bag of tricks.”</p>

<p><b>Baked</b>, seasoned, “he’s only <span class="smcap lowercase">HALF-BAKED</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, soft, inexperienced.</p>

<p><b>Baker’s Dozen</b>, thirteen. Originally the London bakers supplied the
retailers, <i>i.e.</i>, chandlers’ shopkeepers and itinerants, with thirteen loaves
to the dozen, so as to make up what is known as the overweight, the
surplus number, called the <i>inbread</i>, being thrown in for fear of incurring
a penalty for short weight. To “give a man a <span class="smcap lowercase">BAKER’S DOZEN</span>,” in
a slang sense, sometimes means to give him an extra good beating or
pummelling.</p>

<p><b>Balaam</b>, printers’ slang for matter kept in type about monstrous productions
of nature, &amp;c., to fill up spaces in newspapers that would otherwise
be vacant. The term <span class="smcap lowercase">BALAAM-BOX</span> has often been used as the
name of a depository for rejected articles. Evidently from Scripture,
and referring to the “speech of an ass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Bald-Faced Stag</b>, a term of derision applied to a person with a bald
head. Also, still more coarsely, “<span class="smcap lowercase">BLADDER-OF-LARD</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Bale up</b>, an Australian term equivalent to our “Shell out.” A demand
for instantaneous payment.</p>

<p><b>Ballambangjang.</b> The Straits of <span class="smcap lowercase">BALLAMBANGJANG</span>, though unnoticed
by geographers, are frequently mentioned in sailors’ yarns as
being so narrow, and the rocks on each side so crowded with trees inhabited
by monkeys, that the ship’s yards cannot be squared, on
account of the monkey’s tails getting jammed into, and choking up,
the brace blocks.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Ballast</b>, money. A rich man is said to be well-ballasted. If not proud
and over-bearing he is said to carry his ballast well.</p>

<p><b>Balmy</b>, weak-minded or idiotic (not insane).</p>

<p><b>Balmy</b>, sleep; “have a dose of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BALMY</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Bamboozle</b>, to deceive, make fun of, or cheat a person; abbreviated to
<span class="smcap lowercase">BAM</span>, which is sometimes used also as a substantive&mdash;a deception, a
sham, a “sell.” <i>Swift</i> says <span class="smcap lowercase">BAMBOOZLE</span> was invented by a nobleman
in the reign of Charles II.; but this is very likely an error. The
probability is that a nobleman then first <i>used</i> it in polite society. The
term is derived from the <i>Gipsies</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bandannah</b>, originally a peculiar kind of silk pocket-handkerchief, now
slang used to denote all sorts of “stooks,” “wipes,” and “fogles,”
and in fact the generic term for a kerchief, whether neck or pocket.</p>

<p><b>Banded</b>, hungry. From the habit hungry folks have of tying themselves
tight round the middle.</p>

<p><b>Bandy</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Cripple">CRIPPLE</a></span>, a sixpence, so called from this coin being generally
bent or crooked; old term for flimsy or bad cloth, temp. Q. Elizabeth.</p>

<p><b>Bang</b>, to excel or surpass; <span class="smcap lowercase">BANGING</span>, great or thumping.</p>

<p><b>Bang-up</b>, first-rate, in the best possible style.</p>

<p><b>Bank</b>, to put in a place of safety. “<span class="smcap">Bank</span> the rag,” <i>i.e.</i>, secure the
note. Also “to bank” is to go shares.</p>

<p><b>Bank</b>, the total amount possessed by any one, “How’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">BANK</span>?”
“Not very strong; about one and a buck.”</p>

<p><b>Bantling</b>, a child; stated in <i>Bacchus and Venus</i>, 1737, and by <i>Grose</i>,
to be a cant term. This is hardly slang now-a-days, and modern
etymologists give its origin as that of bands or swaddling clothes.</p>

<p><b>Banyan-Day</b>, a day on which no meat is served out for rations; probably
derived from the <span class="smcap lowercase">BANIANS</span>, a Hindoo caste, who abstain from
animal food. Quite as probably from the sanitary arrangements which
have in hot climates counselled the eating of <span class="smcap lowercase">BANYANS</span> and other
fruits in preference to meat on certain days.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Bar</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BARRING</span>, excepting; in common use in the betting-ring; “Two to
one bar one,” <i>i.e.</i>, two to one against any horse with the exception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one. The Irish use of <span class="smcap lowercase">BARRIN’</span> is very similar, and the words <span class="smcap lowercase">BAR</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">BARRING</span> may now be regarded as general.</p>

<p><b>Barber’s Cat</b>, a half-starved sickly-looking person. Term used in connexion
with an expression too coarse to print.</p>

<p><b>Barber’s Clerk</b>, an overdressed shopboy who apes the manners of, and
tries to pass himself off as, a gentleman; a term of reproach applied
not to an artisan but to one of those who, being below, assume airs of
superiority over, handicraftsmen.</p>

<p><b>Barge</b>, a term used among printers (compositors) to denote a case in
which there is an undue proportion of some letters and a corresponding
shortness of those which are most valuable.</p>

<p><b>Bark</b>, an Irish person of either sex. From this term, much in use among
the London lower orders, but for which no etymology can be found,
Ireland is now and then playfully called Barkshire.</p>

<p><b>Barker</b>, a man employed to cry at the doors of “gaffs,” shows, and
puffing shops, to entice people inside. Among touting photographers
he is called a doorsman.</p>

<p><b>Barking-Iron</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BARKER</span>, a pistol. Term used by footpads and thieves
generally.</p>

<p><b>Barnacles</b>, spectacles; possibly a corruption of binoculi; but derived
by some from the barnacle (<i>Lepas Anatifera</i>), a kind of conical shell
adhering to ships’ bottoms. Hence a marine term for goggles,
which they resemble in shape, and for which they are used by sailors
in case of ophthalmic derangement.</p>

<p><b>Barney</b>, an unfair race of any kind: a sell or cross. Also a lark, jollification,
or outing. The word <span class="smcap lowercase">BARNEY</span> is sometimes applied to a
swindle unconnected with the sporting world.</p>

<p><b>Barn Stormers</b>, theatrical performers who travel the country and act
in barns, selecting short and tragic pieces to suit the rustic taste.</p>

<p><b>Barrikin</b>, jargon, speech, or discourse; “We can’t tumble to that
<span class="smcap lowercase">BARRIKIN</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, we don’t understand what he says. “Cheese your
<span class="smcap lowercase">BARRIKIN</span>,” shut up. <i>Miege</i> calls it “a sort of stuff;” <i>Old French</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BARACAN</span>.</p>

<div><p><b><a id="Bash"></a>Bash</b>, to beat, thrash; “<span class="smcap lowercase">BASHING</span> a dona,” beating a woman; originally
a provincial word, applied to the practice of beating walnut trees,
when in bud, with long poles, to increase their productiveness. Hence
the West country proverb&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A woman, a whelp, and a walnut tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more you <span class="smcap lowercase">BASH</span> ’em, the better they be.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The word <span class="smcap lowercase">BASH</span>, among thieves, signifies to flog with the cat or birch.
The worst that can happen to a brutal ruffian is to receive “a <span class="smcap lowercase">BASHING</span>
in, and a <span class="smcap lowercase">BASHING</span> out,”&mdash;a flogging at the commencement and
another at the close of his term of enforced virtue.</p>
</div>

<p><b><a id="Bastile"></a>Bastile</b>, the workhouse. General name for “the Union” amongst the
lower orders of the <i>North</i>. Formerly used to denote a prison, or
“lock-up;” but its abbreviated form, <span class="smcap lowercase">STEEL</span>, is now the favourite
expression with the dangerous classes, some of whom have never heard
of <span class="smcap lowercase">BASTILE</span>, familiar as they are with “steel.”</p>

<p><b>Bat</b>, “on his own <span class="smcap lowercase">BAT</span>,” on his own account. Evident modification of
the cricket term, “off his own bat,” though not connected therewith.&mdash;<i>See</i>

are slang terms on the Stock Exchange, and are frequently used in the
business columns of newspapers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He who sells that of which he is not possessed is proverbially said to sell the
skin before he has caught the <span class="smcap lowercase">BEAR</span>. It was the practice of stock-jobbers, in
the year 1720, to enter into a contract for transferring South Sea stock at a future
time for a certain price; but he who contracted to sell had frequently no stock to
transfer, nor did he who bought intend to receive any in consequence of his
bargain; the seller was, therefore, called a <span class="smcap lowercase">BEAR</span>, in allusion to the proverb, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the buyer a <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL</span>, perhaps only as a similar distinction. The contract was
merely a wager, to be determined by the rise or fall of stock; if it rose, the
seller paid the difference to the buyer, proportioned to the sum determined by
the same computation to the seller.”&mdash;<i>Dr. Warton on Pope.</i></p></div>

<p>These arrangements are nowadays called “time bargains,” and are as
fairly (or unfairly) gambling as any transactions at the Victoria Club or
Tattersall’s, or any of the doings which call for the intervention of the
police and the protestations of pompous City magistrates, who, during
their terms of office, try to be virtuous and make their names immortal.
Certainly <span class="smcap lowercase">BULLING</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">BEARING</span> are as productive of bankruptcy and
misery as are <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Back2">BACKING</a></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Lay">LAYING</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Billy-Barlow</b>, a street clown; sometimes termed a <span class="smcap lowercase">JIM CROW</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">SALTIMBANCO</span>,&mdash;so called from the hero of a slang song. Billy was a

<p><b>Bit</b>, fourpence; in America a 12½ cent piece is called a <span class="smcap lowercase">BIT</span>, and a defaced 20
cent piece is termed a <span class="smcap lowercase">LONG BIT</span>. A <span class="smcap lowercase">BIT</span> is the smallest coin in
Jamaica, equal to 6d. <span class="smcap">Bit</span> usually means the smallest silver coin in
circulation; also a piece of money of any kind. Charles Bannister,
the witty singer and actor, one day meeting a Bow Street runner with
a man in custody, asked what the prisoner had done; and being told

it, said, “Ah, then, he wanted to touch the <span class="smcap lowercase">BIT</span>.”</p>

a Gipsy term. <span class="smcap">Cross-biter</span>, for a cheat, continually occurs in
writers of the sixteenth century. Bailey has <span class="smcap lowercase">CROSS-BITE</span>, a disappointment,
probably the primary sense; and <span class="smcap lowercase">BITE</span> is very probably a contraction
of this.</p>

<p><b>Bit-Faker</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">TURNER OUT</span>, a coiner of bad money.</p>

<p><b>Bit-of-Stuff</b>, overdressed man; a man with full confidence in his

<i>Oxford</i>, but now general.</p>

<p><b>Bittock</b>, a distance of very undecided length. If a North countryman be

and as many dinners, without any prejudice to their <span class="smcap lowercase">BEVERS</span>, drinkings, or
suppers.”&mdash;<i>Beaumont and Fletcher’s Woman Hater</i>, i. 3.</p></div>

<p>Both words are probably from the <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BEVERE, BERE</span>. <i>Latin</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BIBERE</span>. <i>English</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BEVERAGE</span>.</p>
</div>

writing as well as in conversation.</p>

rough jewels.</p>

<div><p><b>Blackguard</b>, a low or dirty fellow; a rough or a hulking fellow, capable
of any meanness or cowardice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A cant word amongst the vulgar, by which is implied a dirty fellow of the
meanest kind, Dr. Johnson says, and he cites only the modern authority of
Swift. But the introduction of this word into our language belongs not to the
vulgar, and is more than a century prior to the time of Swift. Mr. Malone
agrees with me in exhibiting the two first of the following examples:&mdash;The
<i>black-guard</i> is evidently designed to imply a fit attendant on the devil. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Gifford, however, in his late edition of Ben Jonson’s works, assigns an origin
of the name different from what the old examples which I have cited seem to
countenance. It has been formed, he says, from those ‘mean and dirty dependants,
in great houses, who were selected to carry coals to the kitchen,
halls, &amp;c. To this smutty regiment, who attended the progresses, and rode in
the carts with the pots and kettles, which, with every other article of furniture,
were then moved from palace to palace, the people, in derision, gave the name
of <i>black guards</i>; a term since become sufficiently familiar, and never properly
explained.’”&mdash;<i>Todd’s Johnson’s Dictionary.</i></p></div>

<p>Blackguard as an adjective is very powerful.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Blackleg</b>, a rascal, swindler, or card cheat. The derivation of this term
was solemnly argued before the full Court of Queen’s Bench upon a
motion for a new trial for libel, but was not decided by the learned
tribunal. Probably it is from the custom of sporting and turf men
wearing black <i>top-boots</i>. Hence <span class="smcap lowercase">BLACKLEG</span> came to be the phrase for a
professional sporting man, and thence for a professional sporting cheat.
The word is now in its worst sense diminished to “leg.”</p>

<p><b>Black Maria</b>, the sombre van in which prisoners are conveyed from the
police court to prison.</p>

<p><b>Black Monday</b>, the Monday on which boys return to school after the
holidays. Also a low term for the Monday on which an execution
took place.</p>

<p><b>Black Sheep</b>, a “bad lot,” “<i>mauvais sujet</i>;” sometimes “scabby
sheep;” also a workman who refuses to join in a strike.</p>

<p><b>Black Strap</b>, port wine; especially that which is thick and sweet.</p>

<p><b>Blackwork</b>, undertaking. The waiters met at public dinners are often
employed during the day as mutes, etc. Omnibus and cab drivers
regard <span class="smcap lowercase">BLACKWORK</span> as a <i>dernier ressort</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bladder-of-Lard</b>, a coarse, satirical nickname for a bald-headed
person. From similarity of appearance.</p>

<p><b>Blade</b>, a man&mdash;in ancient times the term for a soldier; “knowing
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLADE</span>,” a wide-awake, sharp, or cunning man.</p>

<p><b>Blarney</b>, flattery, powers of persuasion. A castle in the county of Cork.
It is said that whoever kisses a certain stone in this castle will be able
to persuade others of whatever he or she pleases. The name of the
castle is derived from <span class="smcap lowercase">BLADH</span>, a blossom, <i>i.e.</i>, the flowery or fertile
demesne. <span class="smcap">Bladh</span> is also flattery; hence the connexion. A more
than ordinarily persuasive Irishman is said to have “kissed the <span class="smcap lowercase">BLARNEY</span>
stone.”</p>

<p><b>Blast</b>, to curse. Originally a <i>Military</i> expression.</p>

<p><b>Blaze</b>, to leave trace purposely of one’s way in a forest or unknown path
by marking trees or other objects.</p>

<p><b>Blazes</b>, a low synonym for the infernal regions, and now almost for anything.
“Like <span class="smcap lowercase">BLAZES</span>” is a phrase of intensification applied without
any reference to the original meaning. Also applied to the brilliant
habiliments of flunkeys, since the episode of Sam Weller and the
“swarry.”</p>

<p><b>Bleed</b>, to victimize, or extract money from a person, to sponge on, to
make suffer vindictively.</p>

<p><b>Blewed</b>, a man who has lost or spent all his money is said to have
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLEWED</span> it. Also used in cases of robbery from the person, as,

period “between the lights.”</p>

<p><b>Blind Monkeys</b>, an imaginary collection at the Zoological Gardens,
which are supposed to receive care and attention from persons fitted by
nature for such office and for little else. An idle and useless person
is often told that he is only fit to lead the <span class="smcap lowercase">BLIND MONKEYS</span> to evacuate.
Another form this elegant conversation takes, is for one man to tell
another that he knows of a suitable situation for him. “How much
a week? and what to do?” are natural questions, and then comes
the scathing and sarcastic reply, “Five bob a week at the doctor’s&mdash;you’re
to stand behind the door and make the patients sick. They
wont want no physic when they sees your mug.”</p>

<p><b>Blinker</b>, a blackened eye.&mdash;<i>Norwich.</i> Also a hard blow in the eye.
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLINKERS</span>, spectacles.</p>

<p><b>Blink-Fencer</b>, a person who sells spectacles.</p>

aristocracy” by Hyde Park demagogues and a certain unpleasant portion
of the weekly press.</p>

<p><b>Bloater.</b>&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Mild">MILD</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Blob</b> (from <span class="smcap lowercase">BLAB</span>), to talk. Beggars are of two kinds&mdash;those who
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCREEVE</span> (introducing themselves with a <span class="smcap lowercase">FAKEMENT</span>, or false document)
and those who <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOB</span>, or state their case in their own truly
“unvarnished” language.</p>

<p><b>Block</b>, the head. “To <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOCK</span> a hat,” is to knock a man’s hat down
over his eyes.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bonnet2">BONNET</a></span>. Also a street obstruction.</p>

<p><b>Block Ornaments</b>, the small dark-coloured and sometimes stinking
pieces of meat which used to be exposed on the cheap butchers’ blocks
or counters; matters of interest to all the sharp-visaged women in poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
neighbourhoods. Since the great rise in the price of meat there has
been little necessity for butchers to make block ornaments of their odds
and ends. They are bespoke beforehand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘As for that,’ says Will, ‘I could tell it well enough, if I had it, but I must not
be seen anywhere among my old acquaintances, for I am <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOWN</span>, and they will
all betray me.’”&mdash;<i>History of Colonel Jack</i>, 1723.</p></div>

<p>The expression would seem to have arisen from the belief that a flower
might be blighted if “<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOWN</span> upon” by a foul wind or a corrupted
breath. See the condition of the flowers on a dinner-table by the time
the company rise. In <i>America</i>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOW</span>” is slang for to lie in a
boasting manner, to brag or “gas” unduly.</p>

<p><b>Blow a Cloud</b>, to smoke a cigar or pipe&mdash;a phrase used two centuries
ago. Most likely in use as long as tobacco here&mdash;an almost evident
conclusion.</p>

<div><p><b><a id="Blow_Me"></a>Blow Me</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOW ME TIGHT</span>, a vow, a ridiculous and unmeaning ejaculation,
inferring an appeal to the ejaculator; “I’m <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOWED</span> if you will”
is a common expression among the lower orders; “<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOW ME UP</span>” was
the term a century ago.&mdash;<i>See</i> <i>Parker’s Adventures</i>, 1781.&mdash;The expression
<span class="smcap lowercase">BE-BLOWED</span> is now more general. Thomas Hood used to tell a
story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was once asked to contribute to a new journal, not exactly gratuitously, but

been planned according to that estimate. However, I accepted the terms

out. Accordingly, I wrote to my butcher, baker, and other tradesmen, informing
them that it was necessary, for the sake of cheap literature and
the interest of the reading public, that they should furnish me with their
several commodities at a very trifling per-centage above cost price. It will
be sufficient to quote the answer of the butcher:&mdash;‘Sir,&mdash;Respectin’ your

<p><b>Blow Out</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">TUCK IN</span>, a feast. Sometimes the expression is, “<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOW
OUT</span> your bags.” A <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOW OUT</span> is often called a tightener.</p>

<p><b>Blow Up</b>, to make a noise, or scold; formerly a cant expression used
among thieves, now a recognised and respectable phrase. <span class="smcap">Blowing
up</span>, a jobation, a scolding.</p>

<div><p><b>Blowen</b>, originally a showy or flaunting female, now a prostitute only.
In <i>Wilts</i>, a <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOWEN</span> is a blossom. <i>Germ.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BLÜHEN</span>, to bloom. In
<i>German</i>, also, <span class="smcap lowercase">BUHLEN</span> is to court, and <span class="smcap lowercase">BUHLE</span>, a sweetheart.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“O du <i>blühende</i> Mädchen, viel schöne Willkomm!”&mdash;<i>German Song.</i></p></div>

<p><b><a id="Blower"></a>Blower</b>, a girl; a contemptuous name in opposition to <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Jomer">JOMER</a></span>.&mdash;<i>Gipsy.</i></p>

<p><b>Blowsey</b>, a word applied to a rough wench, or coarse woman.</p>

<p><b>Bludger</b>, a low thief, who does not hesitate to use violence, literally one
who will use a bludgeon.</p>

<p><b><a id="Blue"></a>Blue</b>, said of talk that is smutty or indecent. Probably from the French,
“Bibliothèque Bleu.” When the conversation has assumed an entirely
opposite character, it is then said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">BROWN</span> or Quakerish.</p>

<p><b>Blue</b>, a policeman; otherwise <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Blue_Bottle">BLUE BOTTLE</a></span>. From the colour of his
uniform.</p>

<p><b>Blue</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEW</span>, to pawn or pledge. Actually to get rid of.</p>

<p><b>Blue</b>, confounded or surprised; “to look <span class="smcap lowercase">BLUE</span>,” to look astonished,
annoyed, or disappointed.</p>

<p><b>Blue Bellies</b>, a term applied by the Confederate soldiers during the
civil war in America to the Federals, the name being suggested by the
skyblue gaberdines worn by the Northern soldiers. On the other
hand, the “filthy <span class="smcap lowercase">BLUE BELLIES</span>,” as the full title ran, dubbed the
Confederates “Greybacks,” the epithet cutting both ways, as the Southern
soldiers not only wore grey uniforms, but “greyback” is American as
well as English for a louse.</p>

<p><b>Blue Billy</b>, the handkerchief (blue ground with white spots) sometimes
worn and used as a colour at prize-fights. Also, the refuse ammoniacal
lime from gas factories.</p>

<p><b>Blue Blanket</b>, a rough overcoat made of coarse pilot cloth.</p>

<p><b><a id="Blue_Bottle"></a>Blue Bottle</b>, a policeman. This well-known slang term for a London
constable is used by <i>Shakspeare</i>. In Part ii. of <i>King Henry IV.</i>,
act v. scene 4, Doll Tearsheet calls the beadle, who is dragging her
in, a “thin man in a censer, a <span class="smcap lowercase">BLUE-BOTTLE</span> rogue.” This may at
first seem singular, but the reason is obvious. The beadles of Bridewell
whose duty it was to whip the women prisoners were clad in
blue.</p>

<p><b>Blue Butter</b>, mercurial ointment used for the destruction of parasites.</p>

<p><b>Blued</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEWED</span>, tipsy, or drunk. Now given way to <span class="smcap lowercase">SLEWED</span>.</p>

<p><b>Blue Devils</b>, the apparitions supposed to be seen by habitual drunkards.
Form of <i>del. trem.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Blue Moon</b>, an unlimited period. “Once in a blue moon.”</p>

<p><b>Blue Murders.</b> Probably from desperate or alarming cries. A term
used more to describe cries of terror or alarm than for any other
purpose. As, “I heard her calling <span class="smcap lowercase">BLUE MURDERS</span>.”&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">MORBLEU.</span></p>

<p><b>Blue-Pigeon-Flyer</b>, sometimes a journeyman plumber, glazier, or
other workman, who, when repairing houses, strips off the lead, and
makes away with it. This performance is, though, by no means confined
to workmen. An empty house is often entered and the whole of
the roof in its vicinity stripped, the only notice given to the folks
below being received by them on the occasion of a heavy downfall of
rain. The term <span class="smcap lowercase">FLYER</span> has, indeed, of late years been more peculiarly
applied to the man who steals the lead in pursuance of his vocation as
a thief, than to him who takes it because it comes in the way of his
work.</p>

<p><b>Blue Ruin</b>, gin.</p>

<p><b>Blues</b>, a fit of despondency.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BLUE DEVILS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Blues</b>, the police. Sometimes called the Royal Regiment of Foot-guards
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLUE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Bluey</b>, lead.&mdash;German, <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEI</span>. Most likely, though, from the colour, as the
term is of the very lowest slang.</p>

<p><b>Bluff</b>, an excuse; also the game at cards known as euchre in America.</p>

<p><b>Bluff</b>, to turn aside, stop, or excuse.</p>

<p><b><a id="Blunt"></a>Blunt</b>, money. It has been said that this term is from the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOND</span>,
sandy or golden colour, and that a parallel may be found in <span class="smcap lowercase">BROWN</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">BROWNS</span>, the slang for half-pence. Far-fetched as this etymology
seems, it may be correct, as it is borne out by the analogy of similar
expressions. Cf. <span class="smcap lowercase">BLANQUILLO</span>, a word used in Morocco and Southern
Spain for a small Moorish coin. The “asper” (ἄσπρον) of Constantinople
is called by the Turks <span class="smcap lowercase">AKCHEH</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, “little white.”</p>

<p><b>Blurt Out</b>, to speak from impulse, and without reflection, to let out
suddenly.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>B.N.C.</b>, for Brasenose, initials of Brazen Nose College. In spite of the
nose over the gate the probability is the real name was Brasinium. It
is still famous for its beer.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Board-of-Green-Cloth</b>, a facetious synonym for a card or billiard
table.</p>

<p><b>Boat</b>, originally to transport; the term is now applied to penal servitude.
To “get the <span class="smcap lowercase">BOAT</span>,” or to “be <span class="smcap lowercase">BOATED</span>,” is to be sentenced to a long
term of imprisonment equivalent to transportation under the old
system.</p>

<p><b>Bob</b>, a shilling. Formerly <span class="smcap lowercase">BOBSTICK</span>, which may have been the original.
<span class="smcap">Bob-a-nob</span>, a shilling a-head.</p>

<p><b>Bob</b>, “s’help me <span class="smcap lowercase">BOB</span>,” a street oath, equivalent to “so help me God.”
Other words are used in street language for a similarly evasive purpose,
<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CAT</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GREENS</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TATUR</span>, &amp;c., all equally ridiculous. Ignorant
people have a singular habit of saying “so help <i>my</i>,” instead of “<i>me</i>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
whatever the following words may be. This shows how little they
think of the meanings of the phrases most in use among them. The
words “so help” are almost invariably pronounced “swelp.”</p>

<p><b>Bobbery</b>, a squabble, tumult.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Bobbish</b>, very well, clever, spruce. “How are you doing?” “Oh!
pretty <span class="smcap lowercase">BOBBISH</span>.”&mdash;<i>Old.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Bobby"></a>Bobby</b>, a policeman: both <span class="smcap lowercase">BOBBY</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">PEELER</span> were nicknames given to
the new police, in allusion to the Christian name and surname of the
late <i>Sir Robert Peel</i>, who was the prime mover in effecting their
introduction and improvement. The term <span class="smcap lowercase">BOBBY</span> is, however, older
than the introduction of the new police. The official square-keeper,
who is always armed with a cane to drive away idle and disorderly
urchins, has, time out of mind, been called by the said urchins, “<span class="smcap lowercase">BOBBY</span>
the beadle.”</p>

<p><b>Bodkin</b>, any one sitting between two others in a carriage, is said “to ride
<span class="smcap lowercase">BODKIN</span>.” Amongst sporting men, applied to a person who takes his
turn between the sheets on alternate nights, when the hotel has twice
as many visitors as it can comfortably lodge; as, for instance, during a
race-week.</p>

<p><b>Body-Snatcher</b>, a bailiff or runner: <span class="smcap lowercase">SNATCH</span>, the trick by which the
bailiff captures the delinquent. These terms are now almost obsolete,
so far as the pursuits mentioned are concerned.</p>

<p><b>Bog</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BOG-HOUSE</span>, a privy, as distinguished from a water-closet.
Originally printers’ slang, but now very common, and not applied
to any particular form of <i>cabinet d’aisance</i>. “To <span class="smcap lowercase">BOG</span>” is to ease
oneself by evacuation.</p>

<p><b>Bog-Oranges</b>, potatoes. A phrase perhaps derived from the term
“Irish fruit,” which, by some strange peculiarity has been applied to
potatoes; for even the most ignorant Cockney could hardly believe that
potatoes grow in a bog. As, however, the majority of the lower
classes of London do believe that potatoes were indigenous to, and
were first brought from the soil of Ireland, which is also in some parts
supposed to be capable of growing nothing else, they may even believe
that potatoes are actually <span class="smcap lowercase">BOG-ORANGES</span>.</p>

<p><b>Bog-Trotter</b>, satirical name for an Irishman.&mdash;<i>Miege.</i> <i>Camden</i>, however,
speaking of the “debateable land” on the borders of England
and Scotland, says, “both these dales breed notable <span class="smcap lowercase">BOG-TROTTERS</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Bogus</b>, an American term for anything pretending to be that which it is
not&mdash;such as <span class="smcap lowercase">BOGUS</span> degrees, <span class="smcap lowercase">BOGUS</span> titles, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b><a id="Boilers"></a>Boilers</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BROMPTON BOILERS</span>, a name originally given to the New
Kensington Museum and School of Art, in allusion to the peculiar
form of the buildings, and the fact of their being mainly composed of,
and covered with, sheet iron. This has been changed since the
extensive alterations in the building, or rather pile of buildings, and
the words are now the property of the Bethnal Green Museum.&mdash;<i>See</i>

<p><b>Boko</b>, the nose. Originally pugilistic slang, but now general.</p>

<p><b>Bolt</b>, to run away, decamp, or abscond. Also to swallow without
chewing. To eat greedily.</p>

<p><b>Bolus</b>, an apothecary. Origin evident.</p>

<p><b>Bombay Ducks;</b> in the East India Company’s army the Bombay
regiments were so designated. The name is now given to a dried
fish (<i>bummelow</i>), much eaten by natives and Europeans in Western
India.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Bone</b>, to steal or appropriate what does not belong to you. <span class="smcap">Boned</span>,
seized, apprehended.&mdash;<i>Old.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Bone"></a>Bone</b>, good, excellent. <img src="images/sd.jpg" alt="diamond" title="" class="symbol" />, the vagabonds’ hieroglyphic for <span class="smcap lowercase">BONE</span>, or
good, chalked by them on houses and street corners as a hint to
succeeding beggars.&mdash;<i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BON</span>.</p>

<p><b>Bone-Grubber</b>, a person who hunts dust-holes, gutters, and all likely
spots for refuse bones, which he sells at the rag-shops, or to the bone-grinders.
The term was also applied to a resurrectionist. Cobbett
was therefore called “a <span class="smcap lowercase">BONE GRUBBER</span>,” because he brought the
remains of Tom Paine from America.</p>

<p><b>Bone-Picker</b>, a footman.</p>

<p><b>Bones</b>, to rattle the <span class="smcap lowercase">BONES</span>, to play at dice: also called St. Hugh’s
<span class="smcap lowercase">BONES</span>.</p>

<p><b>Bones</b>, “he made no <span class="smcap lowercase">BONES</span> of it,” he did not hesitate, <i>i.e.</i>, undertook
and finished the work without difficulty, “found no <span class="smcap lowercase">BONES</span> in the
jelly.”&mdash;<i>Ancient</i>, <i>vide</i> <i>Cotgrave.</i></p>

<p><b>Boniface</b>, landlord of a tavern or inn.</p>

<p><b><a id="Bonnet"></a>Bonnet</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BONNETER</span>, a gambling cheat. Sometimes called a “bearer-up.”
The <span class="smcap lowercase">BONNET</span> plays as though he were a member of the
general public, and by his good luck, or by the force of his example,
induces others to venture their stakes. Bonneting is often done in
much better society than that to be found in the ordinary gaming
rooms. A man who persuades another to buy an article on which he
receives commission or per-centage is said to <span class="smcap lowercase">BONNET</span> or bear-up for
the seller. Also, a pretence, or make-believe, a sham bidder at
auctions, one who metaphorically blinds or <span class="smcap lowercase">BONNETS</span> others.</p>

<p><b><a id="Bonnet2"></a>Bonnet</b>, to strike a man’s cap or hat over his eyes. Also to “bear-up”
for another.</p>

<p><b>Booby-Trap</b>, a favourite amusement of boys at school. It consists in
placing a pitcher of water on the top of a door set ajar for the purpose;
the person whom they wish to drench is then made to pass through
the door, and receives the pitcher and its contents on his unlucky head.
Books are sometimes used.</p>

<p><b><a id="Book"></a>Book</b>, an arrangement of bets against certain horses marked in a
pocket-book made for that purpose. “Making a <span class="smcap lowercase">BOOK</span> upon it,” is a
common phrase to denote that a man is prepared to lay the odds
against the horses in a race. “That does not suit my <span class="smcap lowercase">BOOK</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>,
does not accord with my other arrangements. The principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
making a <span class="smcap lowercase">BOOK</span>, or betting round, as it is sometimes termed, is to lay
a previously-determined sum against every horse in the race, or as many
horses as possible; and should the bookmaker “get round,” <i>i.e.</i>, succeed
in laying against as many horses as will more than balance the odds
laid, he is certain to be a winner. The <span class="smcap lowercase">BOOKMAKER</span> is distinguished
from the backer by its being his particular business to bet against
horses, or to lay, while the backer, who is also often a professional
gambler, stands by the chance of a horse, or the chances of a set of
horses about which he supposes himself to be possessed of special
information. A bookmaker rarely backs horses for his own particular
fancy&mdash;he may indeed put a sovereign or a fiver on an animal about
which he has been told something, but as a rule if he specially
fancies a horse, the bookmaker lets him “run for the <span class="smcap lowercase">BOOK</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>,
does not lay against him. When a bookmaker backs a horse in the
course of his regular business, it is because he has laid too much
against him, and finds it convenient to share the danger with other
bookmakers.</p>

<p><b>Booked</b>, caught, fixed, disposed of.&mdash;Term in <i>Book-keeping</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bookmaker’s Pocket</b>, a breast-pocket made inside the waistcoat, for
notes of large amount.</p>

<p><b>Books</b>, a pack of cards. Term used by professional card-players.&mdash;<i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Devils_books">DEVIL’S BOOKS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Boom</b>, “to top one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">BOOM</span> off,” to be off or start in a certain direction.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Boom-Passenger</b>, a sailor’s slang term for a convict on board ship.
Derived from the circumstance that prisoners on board convict ships
were chained to, or were made to crawl along or stand on the booms
for exercise or punishment.</p>

<p><b>Boon-Companion</b>, a comrade in a drinking bout. <span class="smcap">Boon</span> evidently
corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">BON</span>.</p>

<p><b>Booze</b>, drink. <i>Ancient Cant</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BOWSE</span>. <span class="smcap">Booze</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SUCK-CASA</span>, a public-house.</p>

<p><b>Booze</b>, to drink, or more properly, to use another slang term, to “lush,”
viz., to drink continually, until drunk, or nearly so. The term is an
old one. <i>Harman</i>, in Queen Elizabeth’s days, speaks of “<span class="smcap lowercase">BOUSING</span>
(or boozing) and belly-cheere.” <i>Massinger</i> also speaks of <span class="smcap lowercase">BOUSE</span>. The
term was good English in the fourteenth century, and came from the
<i>Dutch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BUYZEN</span>, to tipple.</p>

<p><b><a id="Boozing-Ken"></a>Boozing-Ken</b>, a beer-shop, a low public-house.&mdash;<i>Ancient.</i></p>

<p><b>Boozy</b>, intoxicated or fuddled.</p>

<div><p><b>Bore</b>, a troublesome friend or acquaintance, perhaps so called from his
unvaried and pertinacious pushing; a nuisance; anything which wearies
or annoys. The <i>Gradus ad Cantabrigiam</i> suggests the derivation of
<span class="smcap lowercase">BORE</span> from the <i>Greek</i> Βάρος, a burden. <i>Shakspeare</i> uses it, <i>King Henry
VIII.</i>, i. 1&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><i>Grose</i> speaks of this word as being much in fashion about the year
1780-81, and states that it vanished of a sudden without leaving a
trace behind. That this was not so, the constant use of the word nowadays
will prove. The late Prince Consort spoke as follows on the
subject of <span class="smcap lowercase">BORES</span> in his address to the British Association, at Aberdeen,
September 14, 1859&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will not weary you by further examples, with which most of you are better
acquainted than I am myself, but merely express my satisfaction that there
should exist bodies of men who will bring the well-considered and understood
wants of science before the public and the Government, who will even hand
round the begging-box, and expose themselves to refusals and rebuffs, to which
all beggars are liable, with the certainty besides of being considered great
<span class="smcap lowercase">BORES</span>. Please to recollect that this species of <span class="smcap lowercase">BORE</span> is a most useful animal,
well adapted for the ends for which nature intended him. He alone, by constantly
returning to the charge, and repeating the same truths and the same
requests, succeeds in awakening attention to the cause which he advocates, and
obtains that hearing which is granted him at last for self-protection, as the
minor evil compared to his importunity, but which is requisite to make his

<p><b><a id="Bore"></a>Bore</b> (<i>Pugilistic</i>), to press a man to the ropes of the ring by superior
weight. In the world of athletics to <span class="smcap lowercase">BORE</span> is to push an opponent out
of his course. This is a most heinous crime among rowers, as it very
often prevents a man having the full use of the tide, or compels him to
foul, in which case the decision of the race is left to individual judgment,
at times, of necessity, erroneous.</p>

<p><b>Bosh</b>, nonsense, stupidity.&mdash;<i>Gipsy</i> and <i>Persian</i>. Also pure <i>Turkish</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BOSH LAKERDI</span>, empty talk. The term was used in this country as
early as 1760, and may be found in the <i>Student</i>, vol. ii. p. 217. It has
been suggested, with what reason the reader must judge for himself, that
this colloquial expression is from the <i>German</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSH</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSSCH</span>,
answering to our word “swipes.”</p>

<p><b>Bosh</b>, a fiddle. This is a <i>Gipsy</i> term, and so the exclamations “Bosh!”
and “Fiddle-de-dee!” may have some remote connexion.</p>

<p><b>Bosh-Faker</b>, a violin player. Term principally used by itinerants.</p>

<p><b>Bos-Ken</b>, a farmhouse. <i>Ancient.</i>&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Ken">KEN</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Bosky</b>, inebriated. Not much in use now.</p>

<p><b>Bosman</b>, a farmer: “faking a <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSMAN</span> on the main toby,” robbing a
farmer on the highway. <span class="smcap">Boss</span>, a master.&mdash;<i>American.</i> Both terms
from the <i>Dutch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSCH-MAN</span>, one who lives in the woods; otherwise
<i>Boschjeman</i>, or <i>Bushman</i>.</p>

<p><b>Boss-Eyed</b>, said of a person with one eye, or rather with one eye injured,
a person with an obliquity of vision. In this sense sometimes varied
by the term “swivel-eyed.”</p>

<p><b>Bostruchyzer</b>, a small kind of comb for curling the whiskers.&mdash;<i>Oxford
University.</i></p>

<p><b>Botany Bay</b>, Worcester Coll. Oxon., so called from its remote situation.</p>

<p><b>Bother</b>, trouble or annoyance. Any one oppressed with business cares is
said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">BOTHERED</span>. “Don’t <span class="smcap lowercase">BOTHER</span>,” is a common expression.
<span class="smcap">Blother</span>, an old word, signifying to chatter idly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Botheration!</b> trouble, annoyance; “<span class="smcap lowercase">BOTHERATION</span> to it!” “confound
it!” or “deuce take it!”&mdash;an exclamation when irritated.</p>

<p><b>Bottle-Holder</b>, originally a term in prize ring parlance for the second
who took charge of the water-bottle, which was an essential feature in
all pugilistic arrangements. This second used to hold the combatant
on his knee between the rounds, while the other or principal second
sponged, instructed, and advised; an abettor; also the bridegroom’s man
at a wedding. Slang term for Lord Palmerston, derived from a speech
he made some years ago when foreign secretary, in which he described
himself as acting the part of a judicious <span class="smcap lowercase">BOTTLE-HOLDER</span> among the
foreign powers.</p>

<p><b>Bottom</b>, stamina in a horse or man. Power to stand fatigue; endurance
to receive a good beating and still fight on. “A fellow of pluck,
sound wind, and good <span class="smcap lowercase">BOTTOM</span> is fit to fight anything.” This was an
old axiom among prize fighters. Pierce Egan was very fond of the
word.</p>

<div><p><b>Bottom</b>, spirit placed in a glass before aërated water is poured in. As,
“a soda and a <span class="smcap lowercase">BOTTOM</span> of brandy,” “soda and dark <span class="smcap lowercase">BOTTOM</span>,” is
American for soda and brown brandy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Bottomed</span> well with brandy.”&mdash;<i>Bon Gaultier Ballads.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Botts</b>, the colic or bellyache.&mdash;<i>Stable Slang.</i> <i>Burns</i> uses it. <i>See</i> <i>Death
and Dr. Hornbook.</i></p>

<p><b>Botty</b>, conceited, swaggering.&mdash;<i>Stable.</i> An infant’s posteriors.&mdash;<i>Nursery.</i></p>

<p><b>Bounce</b>, impudence, cheek. A showy swindler, a bully.</p>

<p><b>Bounce</b>, to boast, cheat, or bully.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i> Also to lie.</p>

<p><b>Bounceable</b>, prone to bouncing or boasting.</p>

<p><b>Bouncer</b>, a person who steals whilst bargaining with a tradesman, a
swindler, or a lie of more than ordinary dimensions.</p>

<p><b><a id="Bounder"></a>Bounder</b>, a four-wheeled cab. Because of its jumping motion over the
stones. Also a University term for a <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Trap">TRAP</a></span>, which generally has a
very rough time of it on the country roads.</p>

<p><b><a id="Bow-Catcher"></a>Bow-Catcher</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">KISS-CURL</span>, a small curl which a few years back used
to be, and probably will be again some day, twisted on the cheeks or
temples of young&mdash;and often old&mdash;girls, adhering to the face as if
gummed or pasted. Evidently a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">BEAU-CATCHER</span>. In
old times this was called a lovelock, when it was the mark at which all
the Puritan and ranting preachers levelled their pulpit pop-guns,
loaded with sharp and virulent abuse. Hall and Prynne looked upon
all women as strumpets who dared to let the hair depart from a
straight line upon their cheeks. The French prettily termed these
adornments <i>accroche-cœurs</i>, whilst in the United States they were
plainly and unpleasantly called “spit-curls.” Bartlett says: “Spit-curl,
a detached lock of hair curled upon the temple; probably from
having been at first plastered into shape by the saliva.” It is now
understood that the mucilage of quince seed is used by the ladies for
this purpose. When men twist the hair on each side of their faces into
ropes they are sometimes called “bell-ropes,” as being wherewith to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<i>draw the belles</i>. Whether <span class="smcap lowercase">BELL-ROPES</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">BOW-CATCHERS</span>, it is
singular they should form part of a prisoner’s adornment, and that a
jaunty little kiss-curl should, of all things in the world, ornament a
jail dock; yet such was formerly the case. Hunt, “the accomplice
after the fact and King’s evidence against” the murderer of Weare, on
his trial appeared at the bar with a highly pomatumed love-lock
sticking tight to his forehead. In the days of the Civil Wars, the very
last thing a Cavalier would part with was his love-lock.</p>

<p><b>Bowdlerization</b>, a term used in literary circles to signify undue strictness
of treatment caused by over-modesty in editing a classic. To <span class="smcap lowercase">BOWDLERIZE</span>
is to emasculate through squeamishness. From the name
(Bowdler) of one of Shakspeare’s “purifiers.”</p>

<p><b>Bowlas</b>, round tarts made of sugar, apple, and bread, sold in the streets,
especially at the East-end of London.</p>

<p><b>Bowles</b>, shoes.</p>

<p><b>Bowl Out</b>, to put out of the game, to remove out of one’s way, to
detect.&mdash;Originally a <i>Cricketing term</i>, but now general.</p>

<p><b>Box-Harry</b>, a term with bagmen or commercial travellers, implying
dinner and tea at one meal; also dining with “<a href="#Duke_Humphrey">Duke Humphrey</a>,” <i>i.e.</i>,
going without&mdash;which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Box the Compass</b>, to repeat the thirty-two points of the compass
either in succession or irregularly. The method used at sea to teach
boys the points of the mariner’s compass.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Boy</b>, a hump on a man’s back. In low circles it is usual to speak of a
humpbacked man as two persons&mdash;“him and his <span class="smcap lowercase">BOY</span>,” and from
this much coarse fun and personality are at times evolved.</p>

<p><b>Bracelets</b>, handcuffs.</p>

<p><b>Brace up</b>, to pawn stolen goods.</p>

<p><b><a id="Brads"></a>Brads</b>, money. Properly a small kind of nails used by cobblers.&mdash;<i>Compare</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Horse_nails">HORSE NAILS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Brain-Pan</b>, the skull, and <span class="smcap lowercase">BRAIN-CANISTER</span>, the head. Both pugilistic
and exchangeable terms.</p>

<p><b>Bramble-Gelder</b>, a derisive appellation for an agriculturist.&mdash;<i>Suffolk.</i></p>

<p><b>Brandy Pawnee</b>, brandy and water.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Brandy Smash</b>, one of the 365 American drinks, made of brandy and
crushed ice.</p>

<p><b>Bran-New</b>, quite new. Properly <i>Brent</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BRAND</span> or <i>Fire new</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, fresh
from the anvil, or fresh with the manufacturer’s brand upon it.</p>

<p><b>Brass</b>, money. “Tin” is also used, and so are most forms of metal.</p>

<p><b><a id="Brass"></a>Brass</b>, impudence. In 1803 some artillerymen stationed at Norwich
were directed to prove some brass ordnance belonging to the city. To
the report delivered to the corporation was appended this note:&mdash;“<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;It
is customary for the corporal to have the old metal when
any of the pieces burst.” <i>Answer.</i>&mdash;“The corporation is of opinion
that the corporal does not want <span class="smcap lowercase">BRASS</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Brass-Knocker</b>, broken victuals. Used by tramps and cadgers.</p>

<p><b>Brat</b>, a child of either sex. Generally used in an offensive sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Brazen-Faced</b>, impudent, shameless. From <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Brass">BRASS</a></span>. Such a person
is sometimes said “to have rubbed his face with a brass candlestick.”</p>

<div><p><b>Brazil</b>, a hard red wood; “<span class="smcap">hard as Brazil</span>,” a common expression.
<i>Quarles</i> in his <i>Emblems</i> says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thou know’st my brittle temper’s prone to break.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are my bones <span class="smcap lowercase">BRAZIL</span> or my flesh of oak?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><b>Bread-Bags</b>, a nickname given in the army and navy to any one
connected with the victualling department, as a purser or purveyor in
the Commissariat.</p>

<p><b>Bread Basket</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DUMPLING-DEPOT</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">VICTUALLING-OFFICE</span>, &amp;c., were
terms which in the old pugilistic days were given by the “Fancy” to
the digestive organs. Blows in this region were called “porridge
disturbers,” and other fancy names, which were supposed to rob them
of their hardness&mdash;to those who did not receive them.</p>

<p><b>Break-Down</b>, a noisy dance, almost violent enough to break the floor
down; a jovial, social gathering, a “flare up;” in Ireland, a wedding&mdash;<i>American</i>
so far as the dance is concerned.</p>

<div><p><b>Break One’s Back</b>, a figurative expression, implying bankruptcy, or
the crippling of a person’s means.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A story is current of a fashionable author answering a late and rather violent
knock at his door one evening. A coal-heaver wanted to know if the gentleman
would like a cheap ton of coals; he was sorry for troubling him so late, but
‘the party as had a-ordered the two ton and a-half couldn’t be found,’ although
he had driven his ‘waggon for six blessed hours up and down the neighbourhood.
Five-and-twenty is the price, but yer shall have them for 20s.’ Our
author was not to be tempted, he had heard of the trick before; so bidding
the man go away from his house, he shut the door. The man, however,
lingered there, expatiating on the quality of his coals&mdash;‘Acterly givin’ ’em
away, and the gent wont have ’em,’ said he, addressing the neighbourhood in
a loud voice: and the last that was heard of him was his anything but sweet
voice whistling through the keyhole, ‘Will eighteen <i>bob</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BREAK YER BACK</span>?’”</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Break Shins</b>, to borrow money. Probably from an older slang phrase,
“kick,” to ask for drink-money.</p>

<p><b>Break the Ice</b>, to make a commencement, to plunge <i>in medias res</i>.</p>

<div><p><b>Break Up</b>, the conclusion of a performance of any kind&mdash;originally a
school term.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Breaky-Leg</b>, strong drink; “he’s been to Bungay fair, and broke
both his legs,” <i>i.e.</i>, got drunk. In the ancient Egyptian language
the determinative character in the hieroglyphic verb
“to be drank,” has the significant form of the leg of
a man being amputated. “Tangle Leg” is the name
given to New England rum.</p>



<p><b>Breeched</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">TO HAVE THE BAGS OFF</span>, to have plenty of money; “to
be well <span class="smcap lowercase">BREECHED</span>,” to be in good circumstances. Also among
schoolboys to be well flogged.</p>

<p><b>Breeches</b>, “to wear the <span class="smcap lowercase">BREECHES</span>,” said of a wife who usurps the
husband’s prerogative. Equivalent to the remark that “the grey mare
is the better horse.”</p>

<p><b>Breeching</b>, a flogging. Term in use among boys at several private
schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div><p><b><a id="Breef"></a>Breef</b>, probably identical with <span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEF</span>, a shortened card used for cheating
purposes; thus described in an old book of games of about 1720&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Take a pack of cards and open them, then take out all the honours ... and cut
a little from the edges of the rest all alike, so as to make the honours broader
than the rest, so that when your adversary cuts to you, you are certain of an
honour. When you cut to your adversary cut at the ends, and then it is a
chance if you cut him an honour, because the cards at the ends are all of a
length. Thus you may make breefs end-ways as well as sideways.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Modern card-players of a certain kind have considerably improved on
this.</p>

<p><b>Breeks</b>, breeches.&mdash;<i>Scotch</i>, now common.</p>

<p><b>Brick</b>, a “jolly good fellow;” “a regular <span class="smcap lowercase">BRICK</span>,” a staunch fellow.
About the highest compliment that in one word can be paid one
man. Said to be derived from an expression of Aristotle’s&mdash;τετραγωνος
ἀνηρ.</p>

<p><b><a id="Bridge"></a>Bridge</b>, a cheating trick at cards, by which any particular card is cut by
previously curving it by the pressure of the hand. Used in France as
well as in England, and termed in the <i>Parisian Argot</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">FAIRE LE PONT</span>.</p>

<p><b>Brief</b>, a pawnbroker’s duplicate; a raffle card, or a ticket of any kind.</p>

<p><b>Briefs</b>, cards constructed on a cheating principle. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bridge">BRIDGE</a></span>, <a href="#Concaves"><span class="smcap lowercase">CONCAVES</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">CONVEXES</span></a>, <a href="#Longs-and-shorts"><span class="smcap lowercase">LONGS</span>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">SHORTS</span></a>, <span class="smcap lowercase">REFLECTORS</span>, &amp;c. From the <i>German</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEFE</span>, which Baron Heinecken says was the name given to the
cards manufactured at Ulm. <span class="smcap">Brief</span> is also the synonym for a card in the
German <i>Rothwälsch</i> dialect, and <span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEFEN</span> to play at cards. “Item&mdash;beware
of the Joners, (gamblers,) who practice Beseflery with the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEF</span>, (cheating at cards,) who deal falsely and cut one for the other,
cheat with Boglein and spies, pick one <span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEF</span> from the ground, and
another from a cupboard,” &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Liber Vagatorum</i>, ed. by Martin
Luther, in 1529. English translation, by J. C. Hotten, 1860, p. 47.
<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Breef">BREEF</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Brim</b>, a violent irascible woman, as inflammable and unpleasant as brimstone,
from which the word is contracted.</p>

<p><b>Briney</b>, the sea. A “dip in the <span class="smcap lowercase">BRINEY</span>” once a year is a great attraction
to Cockney excursionists. A story is told of one excursionist saying
to another, as they stripped in a double machine, “Why, ’Arry, what
dirty feet you’ve got!” “’Ave I; well yer see I wasn’t down last
year.”</p>

<p><b>Bring-up</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BRING-TO</span>, to stop suddenly, as a team of horses or a
vessel. To <span class="smcap lowercase">BRING-UP</span> also means to feed, clothe, and educate a child.
To <span class="smcap lowercase">BRING-UP</span> by hand is to bring up a newly-born child or animal
without assistance from the natural fount.</p>

<p><b><a id="Brisket-Beater"></a>Brisket-Beater</b>, a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p><b>Broad and Shallow</b>, an epithet applied to the so-called “Broad
Church,” in contradistinction to the “High” and “Low” Churches.
<i>See</i> <a href="#High_and_dry"><span class="smcap lowercase">HIGH</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">DRY</span></a>.</p>

<p><b>Broad-Brim</b>, originally applied to a Quaker only, but now used in
reference to all quiet, sedate, respectable old men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Broad-Cooper</b>, a person employed by brewers to negotiate with
publicans.</p>

<p><b><a id="Broad-Faking"></a>Broad-Faking</b>, playing at cards. Generally used to denote “work”
of the three-card and kindred descriptions.</p>

<p><b>Broad-Fencer</b>, a “k’rect card” seller at races.</p>

<p><b>Broads</b>, cards. <span class="smcap">Broadsman</span>, a card-sharper. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Broad-Faking">Broad-faking</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Broadway Swell</b>, a New York term for a great dandy, Broadway
being the principal promenade in the “Empire City.”</p>

<p><b>Broady</b>, cloth. Evidently a corruption of broadcloth. <span class="smcap">Broady</span> workers
are men who go round selling vile shoddy stuff under the pretence
that it is excellent material, which has been “got on the cross,” <i>i.e.</i>
stolen.</p>

<p><b>Brolly</b>, an umbrella. Term used at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.</p>

<p><b>Brosier</b>, a bankrupt.&mdash;<i>Cheshire.</i> <span class="smcap">Brosier-my-dame</span>, school term, implying
a clearing of the housekeeper’s larder of provisions, in revenge
for stinginess.&mdash;<i>Eton.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Brother-Chip"></a>Brother-Chip</b>, originally fellow carpenter. Almost general now as
brother tradesman of any kind. Also, <span class="smcap lowercase">BROTHER-WHIP</span>, a fellow coachman;
and <span class="smcap lowercase">BROTHER-BLADE</span>, of the same occupation or calling&mdash;originally
a fellow-soldier.</p>

<p><b>Brother-Smut</b>, a term of familiarity. “Ditto, <span class="smcap lowercase">BROTHER SMUT</span>,” <i>tu
quoque</i>.</p>

<p><b>Broth of a Boy</b>, an Irish term for a jolly good fellow.</p>

<p><b>Brown</b>, a halfpenny.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Blunt">BLUNT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Brown</b>, “to do <span class="smcap lowercase">BROWN</span>,” to do well or completely, “doing it <span class="smcap lowercase">BROWN</span>,”
prolonging the frolic, or exceeding sober bounds; “done <span class="smcap lowercase">BROWN</span>,”
taken in, deceived, or surprised.</p>

<p><b>Brown Bess</b>, the old Government regulation musket; a musket with a
browned barrel; also <span class="smcap lowercase">BLACK BESS</span>. A suggestion has been made that
<span class="smcap lowercase">BESS</span> may be from the <i>German</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BUSCHE</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSCHE</span>, a barrel. It is
much more likely, however, that the phrase is derived from the fact that
“the soldier is wedded to his weapon.”</p>

<p><b>Brown-papermen</b>, low gamblers.</p>

<p><b>Brown Study</b>, a reverie. Very common even in educated society, but
hardly admissible in writing, and therefore considered a vulgarism. It
is derived, by a writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, from <span class="smcap lowercase">BROW STUDY</span>, and
he cites the old German <span class="smcap lowercase">BRAUN</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">AUG-BRAUN</span>, an eye-brow.&mdash;<i>Ben
Jonson.</i></p>

<p><b>Brown Talk</b>, conversation of an exceedingly proper character, Quakerish.
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Blue">BLUE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Brown to</b>, to understand, to comprehend.</p>

<p><b>Bruiser</b>, a fighting man, a pugilist. <i>Shakspeare</i> uses the word <span class="smcap lowercase">BRUISING</span>
in a similar sense.</p>

<p><b>Brum</b>, a counterfeit coin. <i>Nearly obsolete.</i> Corruption of <i>Brummagem</i>,
for meaning of which <i>see</i> <a href="#Brummagem">Introductory Chapter</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Brush</b>, a fox’s tail, a house-painter. Also a scrimmage.</p>

<p><b>Brush</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BRUSH-OFF</span>, to run away, or move on quickly.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Bub</b>, drink of any kind.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Grub">GRUB</a></span>. <i>Middleton</i>, the dramatist, mentions
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUBBER</span>, a great drinker.</p>

<p><b>Bub</b>, a teat, woman’s breast, plural <span class="smcap lowercase">BUBBIES</span>; no doubt from <span class="smcap lowercase">BIBE</span>. <i>See</i>
<i>ante</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bubble</b>, to over-reach, deceive, to tempt by means of false promises.&mdash;<i>Old.</i>
(<i>Acta Regia</i>, ii. 248, 1726.)</p>

<p><b><a id="Bubble-and-Squeak"></a>Bubble-and-Squeak</b>, a dish composed of pieces of cold roast or boiled
meat and greens, afterwards fried, which have thus first <span class="smcap lowercase">BUBBLED</span> in the
<i>pot</i>, and then <span class="smcap lowercase">SQUEAKED</span> or hissed in the <i>pan</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bubble-Company</b>, a swindling association.</p>

<p><b><a id="Buckled"></a>Buckled</b>, to be married. Also to be taken in custody. Both uses of
the word common and exchangeable among the London lower classes.</p>

<p><b>Bubbley-Jock</b>, a turkey, or silly boasting fellow; a prig.&mdash;<i>Scottish.</i>
In the north of England the bird is called a <span class="smcap lowercase">BOBBLE-COCK</span>. Both
names, no doubt, from its cry, which is supposed by imaginative
persons to consist of the two words exactly.</p>

<p><b>Buck</b>, a gay or smart man; an unlicensed cabman; also a large marble
used by schoolboys.</p>

<p><b>Buck</b>, sixpence. The word is rarely used by itself, but generally denotes
the sixpence attached to shillings in reference to cost, as, “three and
a <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK</span>,” three shillings and sixpence. Probably a corruption of
<a href="#Fye-buck">Fyebuck</a>.</p>

<p><b>Buckhorse</b>, a smart blow or box on the ear; derived from the name of
a celebrated “bruiser” of that name. Buckhorse was a man who
either possessed or professed insensibility to pain, and who would
for a small sum allow anyone to strike him with the utmost force on
the side of the face.</p>

<p><b>Buckle</b>, to bend; “I can’t <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCKLE</span> to that.” I don’t understand it; to
yield or give in to a person. <i>Shakspeare</i> uses the word in the latter
sense, <i>Henry IV.</i>, i. 1; and <i>Halliwell</i> says that “the commentators do
not supply another example.”</p>

<p><b>Buckle-Beggar</b>, a <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Couple-beggar">COUPLE-BEGGAR</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Buckle-to</b>, to bend to one’s work, to begin at once, and with great
energy&mdash;from buckling-to one’s armour before a combat, or fastening
on a bundle.</p>

<p><b>Buckley</b>, “Who struck <span class="smcap">Buckley</span>?” a common phrase used to irritate
Irishmen. The story is that an Englishman having struck an Irishman
named Buckley, the latter made a great outcry, and one of his
friends rushed forth screaming, “Who struck Buckley?” “I did,”
said the Englishman, preparing for the apparently inevitable combat.
“Then,” said the ferocious Hibernian, after a careful investigation of
the other’s thews and sinews, “then, sarve him right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Buckra</b>, a white man. The original of this term is a “flogging man,”
from the Hebrew, and the application of it to the whites by the West
Indian negroes is, therefore, rather interesting. They probably first
learned it from a missionary.</p>

<p><b>Buckshish</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCKSHEESH</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">BACKSHEESH</span>, a present of money. Over
all India, and the East generally, the natives lose no opportunity of
asking for <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCKSHISH</span>. The usage is such a complete nuisance that
the word is sometimes answered by a blow; this is termed <span class="smcap lowercase">BAMBOO
BUCKSHISH</span>. <span class="smcap">Buckshish</span> has taken up a very firm residence in
Europe&mdash;may, in fact, on a much larger scale than that of Asia, be said
to have always had an existence here. <span class="smcap">Buckshish</span> is a very important
item in the revenues of officials who hold positions of considerable importance,
as well as in those of their humbler brethren. During the
recent visit of the Shah of Persia, that potentate discovered that
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUCKSHISH</span> was by no means peculiar to the East.</p>

<p><b>Budge</b>, to move, to “make tracks.”</p>

<p><b>Budge</b>, strong drink; <span class="smcap lowercase">BUDGY</span>, drunk; <span class="smcap lowercase">BUDGING-KEN</span>, a public-house;
“cove of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BUDGING-KEN</span>,” the landlord. Probably a corruption of
<span class="smcap lowercase">BOOZE</span>. Probably also, on the lucus a non lucendo principle, because
its use made one incapable of budging.</p>

<p><b>Buff</b>, the bare skin; “stripped to the <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFF</span>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Buff"></a>Buff</b>, to swear to, or accuse; generally used in reference to a wrongful
accusation, as, “Oh, <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFF</span> it on to him.” <i>Old</i> word for boasting,
1582.</p>

<p><b>Buffer</b>, a navy term for a boatswain’s mate, one of whose duties it is&mdash;or
was&mdash;to administer the “<a href="#Cat">cat</a>.”</p>

<p><b>Buffer</b>, a familiar expression for a jolly acquaintance, probably from
the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BOUFFARD</span>, a fool or clown; a “jolly old <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFFER</span>,” said of
a good-humoured or liberal old man. In 1737, a <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFFER</span> was a
“rogue that killed good sound horses for the sake of their skins, by
running a long wire into them.”&mdash;<i>Bacchus and Venus.</i> The term
was once applied to those who took false oaths for a consideration;
but though the word has fallen into disuse there is no particular reason
for imagining that the practice has.</p>

<p><b>Buffer</b>, a woman employed in a Sheffield warehouse to give the final
polish to goods previously to their being plated.</p>

<p><b>Buffer</b>, a dog. Dogs’ skins were formerly in great request&mdash;hence the
term <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFF</span>, meaning in old English <i>to skin</i>. It is still used in the
ring, <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFFED</span> meaning stripped naked, though the term <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFF</span>, as applied
to the skin, is most likely due to its resemblance to the leather
so called. “Stripped to the <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFF</span>,” cannot have any reference to
dog skinning, though it may have originally referred to the <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFF</span>
jerkins worn under defensive armour. In Irish cant, <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFFER</span> is a
<i>boxer</i>. The <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFFER</span> of a railway-carriage doubtless received its very
appropriate name from the old pugilistic application of this term.</p>

<p><b>Buffle-Head</b>, a stupid or obtuse person.&mdash;<i>Miege.</i> <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BUFFELHAUPT</span>,
buffalo-headed. Occurs in <i>Plautus’ Comedies made English</i>,
1694.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Buffs</b>, the Third Regiment of Foot in the British army. From their facings.</p>

<p><b>Buffy</b>, intoxicated.</p>

<p><b>Buggy</b>, a gig, or light chaise. Common term in America and in India,
as well as in England.</p>

<p><b>Bug-Hunter</b>, a low wretch who plunders drunken men.</p>

<p><b>Bug-Walk</b>, a coarse term for a bed.</p>

<p><b>Build</b>, applied in fashionable slang to the make or style of dress, &amp;c.
“It’s a tidy <span class="smcap lowercase">BUILD</span>, who made it?” A tailor is sometimes called a
“trousers’ <span class="smcap lowercase">BUILDER</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Bulger</b>, large; synonymous with <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Buster2">BUSTER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Bulky</b>, a constable.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Bull"></a>Bull</b>, one who agrees to purchase stock at a future day, at a stated price,
but who simply speculates for a rise in public securities to render the
transaction a profitable one. Should stocks fall, the <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL</span> is then
called upon to pay the difference. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bear">BEAR</a></span>, who is the opposite of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">BULL</span>, the former selling, the latter purchasing&mdash;the one operating for
a <i>fall</i>, the other for a <i>rise</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bull</b>, a crown-piece, formerly <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL’S EYE</span>. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Work">WORK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Bull</b>, term amongst prisoners for the meat served to them in jail. Also
very frequently used instead of the word beef. The costermonger often
speaks of his dinner, when he has beef, as a “bit o’ <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL</span>,” without
any reference to its being either tough or tender, but he never speaks of
mutton as “sheep.”</p>

<p><b>Bull-Beef</b>, a term of contempt; “as ugly as <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL-BEEF</span>,” “go to the
billy-fencer, and sell yourself for <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL-BEEF</span>.” Sometimes used to
indicate full size of anything. “There was he, as big as <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL-BEEF</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Bulldogs</b>, the runners who accompany the proctor in his perambulations,
and give chase to runaways.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Bullet</b>, to discharge from a situation. To shake the <span class="smcap lowercase">BULLET</span> at anyone,
is to threaten him with “the sack,” but not to give him actual notice
to leave. To get the <span class="smcap lowercase">BULLET</span> is to get notice, while to get the instant
<span class="smcap lowercase">BULLET</span> is to be discharged upon the spot. The use of the term is
most probably derived from a fancied connexion between it and the
word discharge.</p>

<p><b>Bullfinch</b>, a hunting term for a large, thick, quickset hedge, difficult
alike to “top” or burst through. Probably a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL-FENCE</span>,
a fence made to prevent cattle straying either in or out.</p>

<p><b>Bull the Cask</b>, to pour hot water into an empty rum puncheon, and
let it stand until it extracts the spirit from the wood. The mixture is
drunk by sailors in default of something stronger.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Bully</b>, a braggart; in the language of the streets, a man of the most
degraded morals, who protects fallen females, and lives off their miserable
earnings.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare</i>, in <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, uses the
word in its old form, as a term of endearment. This epithet is often applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in a commendable sense among the vulgar; thus&mdash;a good fellow or
a good horse will be termed “a <span class="smcap lowercase">BULLY</span> fellow,” “a <span class="smcap lowercase">BULLY</span> horse;” and
“a <span class="smcap lowercase">BULLY</span> woman” signifies a right, good motherly old soul. Among
Americans, “<span class="smcap lowercase">BULLY</span> for you,” is a commendatory phrase, and “that’s
<span class="smcap lowercase">BULLY</span>” is a highly eulogistic term.</p>

<p><b>Bullyrag</b>, to abuse or scold vehemently; to swindle one out of money
by intimidation and sheer abuse.</p>

<p><b>Bum</b>, the part on which we sit.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BUMBAGS</span>, trousers; <i>Gael.</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUN</span>, a base or bottom; <i>Welsh</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BON</span>, the lowest or worst part
of anything.</p>

<p><b>Bum-Bailiff</b>, a sheriff’s-officer&mdash;a term, some say, derived from the
proximity which this gentleman generally maintains to his victims.
Blackstone says it is a corruption of “bound bailiff.” A <span class="smcap lowercase">BUM-BAILIFF</span>
was generally called “bummy.”</p>

<p><b>Bumble</b>, to muffle. <span class="smcap">Bumble-footed</span>, club-footed, or awkward in the
gait.</p>

<p><b>Bumble</b>, a beadle. Adopted from <i>Dickens’s</i> character in <i>Oliver Twist</i>.
This and “<span class="smcap lowercase">BUMBLEDOM</span>” are now common.</p>

<p><b>Bumble-Puppy</b>, a game played in public-houses on a large stone, placed
in a slanting direction, on the lower end of which holes are excavated,
and numbered like the holes in a bagatelle-table. The player rolls a
stone ball, or marble, from the higher end, and according to the
number of the hole it falls into the game is counted. It is undoubtedly
the very ancient game of <i>Troule-in-madame</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bumbles</b>, coverings for the eyes of horses that shy in harness.</p>

<p><b>Bumbrusher</b>, an usher at a school.</p>

<p><b><a id="Bumclink"></a>Bumclink</b>, in the Midland counties the inferior beer brewed for haymakers
and harvest labourers. Derivation obvious.</p>

<p><b>Bum-Curtain</b>, an old name for academical gowns when they were
worn scant and short, especially those of the students of St. John’s
College.&mdash;<i>Camb. Univ.</i> Any ragged or short academical gown.</p>

<div><p><b>Bummarees</b>, a term given to a class of speculating salesmen at
Billingsgate market, not recognised as such by the trade, but who get
a living by buying large quantities of fish from the salesmen and re-selling
them to smaller buyers. The word has been used in the statutes and
bye-laws of the market for upwards of 200 years. It has been variously
derived. Some persons think it may be from the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BONNE
MARÉE</span>, good fresh fish! “Marée signifie toute sorte de poisson de
mer qui n’est pas sale; bonne marée&mdash;<i>marée fraîche</i>, vendeur de
marée.”&mdash;<i>Dict. de l’Acad. Franc.</i> The <span class="smcap lowercase">BUMMAREES</span> are accused of
many trade tricks. One of them is to blow up codfish with a pipe
until they look double their actual size. Of course when the fish
come to table they are flabby, sunken, and half dwindled away. In
Norwich, to <span class="smcap lowercase">BUMMAREE</span> one is to run up a score at a public-house just
open, and is equivalent to “running into debt with one.” One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the advertisements issued by Hy. Robinson’s “Office,” over against
Threadneedle Street, was this:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Bummer</b>, literally one who sits or idles about; a loafer; one who
sponges upon his acquaintances. In California, men who profess to
be journalists, and so obtain free dinners and drinks, are called
“literary <span class="smcap lowercase">BUMMERS</span>.” Although the term is not much in use in this
country, the profession of bumming, both literary and otherwise, is
freely practised.</p>

<p><b>Bumper</b>, according to Johnson from “bump,” but probably from <i>French</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">BON PÈRE</span>, the fixed toast in monastic life of old, now used for “full
measure.” A match at quoits, bowls, &amp;c., may end in a “<span class="smcap lowercase">BUMPER</span>
game,” if the play and score be all on one side. <span class="smcap">Bumper</span> is used in
sporting and theatrical circles to denote a benefit which is one in
reality as well as in name.</p>

<p><b>Bumptious</b>, arrogant, self-sufficient. One on very good terms with
himself is said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">BUMPTIOUS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Bunce</b>, costermongers’ perquisites; the money obtained by giving
light weight, &amp;c.; costermongers’ goods sold by boys on commission.
In fact anything which is clear profit or gain is said to be “all
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUNCE</span>.” Probably a corruption of <i>bonus</i>; <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bone">BONE</a></span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BONER</span>, being the
slang for good. <span class="smcap">Bunce</span>, <i>Grose</i> gives as the cant word for money.</p>

<p><b>Bunch-of-Fives</b>, the hand, or fist.</p>

<p><b>Bundle</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">BUNDLE</span> a person off,” <i>i.e.</i>, to pack him off, send him
flying.</p>

<p><b>Bundling</b>, men and women sleeping together, where the divisions of the
house will not permit of better or more decent accommodation, with
all their clothes on. <span class="smcap">Bundling</span> was originally courting done in bed,
the lovers being tied or bundled up to prevent undue familiarities.
The practice still obtains in some parts of Wales.</p>

<p><b>Bung</b>, the landlord of a public-house. Much in use among sporting
men.</p>

<p><b>Bung</b>, to give, pass, hand over, drink, or to perform almost any action.

<p><b>Bunk</b>, to decamp. “<span class="smcap">Bunk</span> it!” <i>i.e.</i>, be off.</p>

<p><b>Bunker</b>, beer.</p>

<p><b>Bunkum</b>, an American importation, denoting false sentiments in speaking,
pretended enthusiasm, &amp;c. The expression arose from a speech made
by a North Carolina senator named Buncombe.</p>

<p><b>Bunter</b>, a prostitute, a street-walking female thief.</p>

<p><b><a id="Burdons_Hotel"></a>Burdon’s Hotel</b>, Whitecross Street Prison, of which the Governor was
a Mr. Burdon. Almost every prison has a nickname of this kind,
either from the name of the Governor, or from some local circumstance.
The Queen’s Bench has also an immense number of names&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Spike_Park">SPIKE
PARK</a></span>, &amp;c.; and every Chief-Justice stands godfather to it.</p>

<p><b><a id="Burerk"></a>Burerk</b>, a lady, a showily-dressed woman.</p>

<p><b>Burke</b>, to kill, to murder, secretly and without noise, by means of
strangulation. From Burke, the notorious Edinburgh murderer, who,
with an accomplice named Hare, used to decoy people into the den he
inhabited, kill them, and sell their bodies for dissection. The wretches
having been apprehended and tried, Burke was executed, while Hare,
having turned king’s evidence, was released. Bishop and Williams
were their London imitators. The term <span class="smcap lowercase">BURKE</span> is now usually applied
to any project that is quietly stopped or stifled&mdash;as “the question has
been <span class="smcap lowercase">BURKED</span>.” A book suppressed before publication is said to be
<span class="smcap lowercase">BURKED</span>.</p>

<p><b>Burra</b>, great; as <span class="smcap lowercase">BURRA SAIB</span>, a great man; <span class="smcap lowercase">BURRA KHANAII</span>, a

<div><p><b>Bus</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BUSS</span>, an abbreviation of “omnibus,” a public carriage. Also, a
kiss, abbreviation of <i>Fr.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BAISER</span>. A Mr. Shillibeer started the first
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUS</span> in London. A shillibeer is now a hearse and mourning coach all
in one, used by the very poorest mourners and shabbiest undertakers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Why is Temple Bar like a lady’s veil? Because it wants to be removed to make

<p><b>Bus</b>, business (of which it is a contraction) or action on the stage, so
written, but pronounced <span class="smcap lowercase">BIZ</span>.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i> <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Biz">BIZ</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Business</b>, the action which accompanies dialogue. “His <span class="smcap lowercase">BUSINESS</span> was
good.” Generally applied to byplay.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Busk</b>, to sell obscene songs and books at the bars and in the tap-rooms of
public-houses. Sometimes it implies selling other articles. Also to
“work” public-houses and certain spots as an itinerant musician or
vocalist.</p>

<p><b><a id="Buster"></a>Buster</b> (<span class="smcap lowercase">BURSTER</span>), a small new loaf; “twopenny <span class="smcap lowercase">BUSTER</span>,” a twopenny
loaf. “A penn’orth o’ <span class="smcap lowercase">BEES-WAX</span> (cheese) and a penny <span class="smcap lowercase">BUSTER</span>,” a
common snack at beershops. A halfpenny loaf is called a “starver.”</p>

<i>Icelandic</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSTRA</span>.</p>

<p><b>Bustle</b>, money; “to draw the <span class="smcap lowercase">BUSTLE</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Busy-Sack</b>, a carpet-bag.</p>

<p><b>Butcha</b>, a Hindoo word in use among Englishmen for the young of any
animal. In England we ask after the children; in India the health
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BUTCHAS</span> is tenderly inquired for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Butcher</b>, the king in playing-cards. When card-playing in public
houses was common, the kings were called butchers, the queens
bitches, and the knaves jacks. The latter term is now in general use.</p>

<p><b>Butcher’s Mourning</b>, a white hat with a black mourning hatband.
Probably because, under any circumstances, a butcher would
rather not wear a black hat. White hats and black bands have, however,
become genteel ever since the late Prince Consort patronized
them, though they retain a deal of the old sporting leaven.</p>

<p><b>Butter</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BATTER</span>, praise or flattery. To <span class="smcap lowercase">BUTTER</span>, to flatter, cajole.
Same as “soft soap” and “soft sawder.” Soft words generally.
Maybe from the old proverb, “Fine words butter no parsneps.”</p>

<p><b>Butter-Fingered</b>, apt to let things fall; greasy or slippery-fingered.</p>

<p><b>Button</b>, a decoy, sham purchaser, &amp;c. At any mock or sham auction
seedy specimens may be seen. Probably from the connexion of buttons
with Brummagem, which is often used as a synonym for a sham.&mdash;<i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bonnet">BONNET</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Buttoner</b>, a man who entices another to play.</p>

<p><b>Buttons</b>, a page,&mdash;from the rows of gilt buttons which adorn his jacket.</p>

<p><b>Buttons</b>, “not to have all one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">BUTTONS</span>;” to be deficient in intellect.
To “make <span class="smcap lowercase">BUTTONS</span>” means for some occult reason to look sorry and
sad. “He was making <span class="smcap lowercase">BUTTONS</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, he was looking sorrowful.
Perhaps because button-making is a sorry occupation.</p>

<p><b>Butty</b>, a word used in the mining districts to denote a kind of overseer.
Also used by the Royal Marines in the sense of comrade; a policeman’s
assistant, one of the staff in a <i>mêlée</i>.</p>

<p><b>Buz</b>, to share equally the last of a bottle of wine, when there is not
enough for a full glass to each of the party.</p>

<p><b>Buz</b>, a well-known public-house game, played as follows:&mdash;“The chairman
commences saying “one,” the next on the left hand “two,” the
next “three,” and so on to <i>seven</i>, when “<span class="smcap lowercase">BUZ</span>” must be said. Every
seven and multiple of 7, as 14, 17, 21, 27, 28, &amp;c., must not be mentioned,
but “<span class="smcap lowercase">BUZ</span>” instead. Whoever breaks the rule pays a fine, which is
thrown on the table, and the accumulation expended in drink for the
company. <i>See</i> “<span class="smcap lowercase">SNOOKS</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">WALKER</span>” for more complicated
varieties of a similar game. These “parlour pastimes” are often not
only funny, but positively ingenious. But the Licensing Act and a
zealous police are fast clearing them all out.</p>

<p><b>Buz</b>, to pick pockets; <span class="smcap lowercase">BUZZING</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">BUZ-FAKING</span>, robbing.</p>

<p><b><a id="Buz-Bloke"></a>Buz-Bloke</b>, a pickpocket who principally confines his attention to
purses and loose cash. <i>Grose</i> gives <span class="smcap lowercase">BUZ-GLOAK</span>, an ancient cant
word. <span class="smcap">Gloak</span> was old cant for a man. <span class="smcap">Buz-napper</span>, a young pickpocket.</p>

<p><b>Buz-man</b>, an informer; from <span class="smcap lowercase">BUZ</span>, to whisper, but more generally a
thief.</p>

<p><b>Buz-napper’s Academy</b>, a school in which young thieves were
trained. Figures were dressed up, and experienced tutors stood in
various difficult attitudes for the boys to practise upon. When clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
enough they were sent on the streets. Dickens gives full particulars
of this old style of business in <i>Oliver Twist</i>.</p>

<p><b>Buzzer</b>, a pickpocket. <i>Grose</i> gives <span class="smcap lowercase">BUZ-COVE</span> and, as above mentioned,
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Buz-Bloke">BUZ-GLOAK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Byblow</b>, an illegitimate child.</p>

<p><b>By George</b>, an exclamation similar to <span class="smcap lowercase">BY JOVE</span>. The term is older than
is frequently imagined&mdash;vide <i>Bacchus and Venus</i> (p. 117), 1737.
“’Fore (or by) <span class="smcap lowercase">GEORGE</span>, I’d knock him down.” Originally in reference
to Saint George, the patron saint of England, or possibly to the House
of Hanover.</p>

<p><b>By Golly</b>, an ejaculation, or oath; a compromise for “by God.” <span class="smcap">By
gum</span> is another oblique oath. In the United States, small boys are
permitted by their guardians to say <span class="smcap lowercase">GOL DARN</span> anything, but they are
on no account allowed to commit the profanity of G&mdash;d d&mdash;&mdash;n anything.
A manner of “sailing close to the wind” which is objectionable
to the honest mind. A specimen ejaculation and moral waste-pipe
for interior passion or wrath is seen in the exclamation&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">BY THE EVER-LIVING
JUMPING-MOSES</span>&mdash;a harmless and ridiculous phrase, that from
its length is supposed to expend a considerable quantity of fiery anger.</p>

<p><b>By Jingo</b>, an oath or exclamation having no particular meaning, and
no positive etymology, though it is believed by some that <span class="smcap lowercase">JINGO</span> is
derived from the Basque <i>jenco</i>, the devil.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>Cab</b>, in statutory language, “a hackney carriage drawn by one horse.”
Abbreviated from the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CABRIOLET</span>; originally meaning “a light
low chaise.” The wags of Paris playing upon the word (quasi <i>cabri</i>
au lait) used to call a superior turn-out of the kind a <i>cabri au crême</i>.
Our abbreviation, which certainly smacks of slang, has been stamped
with the authority of the Legislature, and has been honoured by
universal custom.</p>

<p><b>Cab</b>, to stick together, to muck, or tumble up&mdash;<i>Devonshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Cabbage</b>, pieces of cloth said to be purloined by tailors. Any small
profits in the way of material.</p>

<p><b>Cabbage</b>, to pilfer or purloin. Termed by <i>Johnson</i> a “cant word,”
but adopted by later lexicographers as a respectable term. Said to
have been first used in the above sense by <i>Arbuthnot</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cabbage-Head</b>, a soft-headed person.</p>

<p><b>Cabby</b>, popular name for the driver of a cab. This title has almost supplanted
the more ancient one of jarvey.</p>

<p><b>Caboose</b>, the galley or cook-house of a ship; a term used by tramps to
indicate a kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Cackle-Tub</b>, a pulpit.</p>

<p><b>Cackling-Cove</b>, an actor. Also called a <span class="smcap lowercase">MUMMERY-COVE</span>.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Cad</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CADGER</span> (from which it is shortened), a mean or vulgar fellow; a
beggar; one who would rather live on other people than work for
himself; a man who tries to worm something out of another, either
money or information. <i>Johnson</i> uses the word, and gives <i>huckster</i> as
the meaning, in which sense it was originally used. Apparently from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAGER</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">GAGER</span>, the <i>old Cant</i> term for a man. The exclusives at the
English Universities apply the term <span class="smcap lowercase">CAD</span> to all non-members. It has also
been suggested that the word may be a contraction of the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CADET</span>.</p>

<p><b>Cad</b>, an omnibus conductor. Of late years the term has been generically
applied to the objectionable class immortalized by Thackeray under
the title of snob. A great deal of caddism is, however, perpetrated by
those who profess to have the greatest horror of it&mdash;the upper classes&mdash;a
fact which goes far to prove that it is impossible to fairly ascribe a
distinctive feature to any grade of society.</p>

<p><b>Cadge</b>, to beg in an artful, wheedling manner.&mdash;<i>North.</i> In Scotland to
<span class="smcap lowercase">CADGE</span> is to wander, to go astray. <i>See</i> under <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Codger">CODGER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Cadging</b>, begging, generally with an eye to pilfering when an opportunity
occurs. To be “on the cadge” is almost synonymous with “on
the make.”</p>

<p><b>Cag</b>, to irritate, affront, anger. Schoolboy slang.</p>

<p><b>Cage</b>, a minor kind of prison. A country lock-up which contained no
offices.</p>

<p><b>Cagmag</b>, bad food, scraps, odds and ends; or that which no one could
relish. <i>Grose</i> give <span class="smcap lowercase">CAGG MAGGS</span>, old and tough Lincolnshire geese,
sent to London to feast the poor cockneys. <i>Gael.</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>Welsh</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAC</span>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">MAGN</span>. A correspondent at Trinity College, Dublin, considers
this as originally a University slang term for a <i>bad cook</i>, κακὸς

<p><b>Calculate</b>, a word much in use among the inhabitants of the Western
States U.S., as “I <span class="smcap lowercase">CALCULATE</span> you are a stranger here.” New
Englanders use the word “guess” instead of <span class="smcap lowercase">CALCULATE</span>, while the
Virginians prefer to say “reckon.”</p>

<p><b>Caleb Quotem</b>, a parish clerk; a jack of all trades. From a character
in <i>The Wags of Windsor</i>.</p>

<p><b>California</b>, or <span class="smcap">Californians</span>, money. Term generally applied to gold

morning.”</p>

to remove to another spot, to desist. Also to give in, yield, at any
game or business. Probably from the “<span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>” call in cribbage.</p>

Army.</p>

<p><b><a id="Camesa"></a>Camesa</b>, shirt or chemise.&mdash;<i>Span.</i> <i>See</i> its abbreviated form, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Mish">MISH</a></span>, from the

De Lacy Evans’s Spanish Legion on their return. <i>See</i> Somerville’s
account of the Span. Leg., for the curious facility with which the
lower classes in England adopt foreign words as slang and cant
terms. <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CAMICIA</span>. This latter is the more likely etymology,
as anyone who visits the various quarters where Irish, Italians, and a
mongrel mixture of half-a-dozen races congregate and pig together,
will admit.</p>

<p><b>Camister</b>, a preacher, clergyman, or master.</p>

<p><b><a id="Canary"></a>Canary</b>, a sovereign. From the colour. Very old slang indeed.</p>

<p><b>Canister</b>, the head.&mdash;<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>

<p><b>Cannibals</b>, the training boats for the Cambridge freshmen, <i>i.e.</i>, “<span class="smcap">Cannot-pulls</span>.”
The term is applied both to boats and rowers.&mdash;<i>See</i>

and machines figure.</p>

“a <span class="smcap lowercase">CANT</span> over the buttock,” a throw or toss in wrestling.</p>

<p><b>Cantab</b>, a student at Cambridge.</p>

<p><b>Cantankerous</b>, litigious, bad-tempered. An American corruption probably
of contentious. A reviewer of an early edition of this book
derives it from the <i>Anglo-Norman</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CONTEK</span>, litigation or strife.
Others have suggested “cankerous” as the origin. <i>Bailey</i> has <span class="smcap lowercase">CONTEKE</span>,
contention as a Spenserian word, and there is the <i>O.E.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CONTEKORS</span>,
quarrelsome persons.</p>

<p><b>Cant of Togs</b>, a gift of clothes.</p>

<p><b>Canvasseens</b>, sailors’ canvas trousers.</p>

<p><b>Capper-Clawing</b>, female encounter, where caps are torn and nails
freely used. Sometimes it is pronounced <span class="smcap lowercase">CLAPPER-CLAW</span>. The word
occurs in <i>Shakspeare</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, act v. sc. 4.</p>

<p><b>Caravan</b>, a railway train, especially a train expressly chartered to convey
people to a prize fight.</p>

<p><b>Caravansera</b>, a railway station. In pugilistic phraseology a tip for
the starting point might have been given thus. “The <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCH</span> must
be <span class="smcap lowercase">TOED</span> at sharp five, so the <span class="smcap lowercase">CARAVAN</span> will start at four from the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CARAVANSERA</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Cardinal</b>, a lady’s red cloak. A cloak with this name was in fashion in

of the vestments of a cardinal. Also mulled red wine.</p>

<p><b>Cardwell’s Men</b>, officers promoted in pursuance of the new system of
non-purchase.</p>

<p><b>Carney</b>, soft hypocritical language. Also, to flatter, wheedle, or

<span class="smcap lowercase">CARNISH-KEN</span>, a thieves’ eating-house; “cove of the <span class="smcap lowercase">CARNISH-KEN</span>,”
the keeper thereof.&mdash;<i>North Country Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Caroon</b>, five shillings. <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">COURONNE</span>; <i>Gipsy</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">COURNA</span>; <i>Spanish</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CORONA</span>.</p>

<p><b>Carpet</b>, “upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">CARPET</span>,” any subject or matter that is uppermost for
discussion or conversation. Frequently quoted as <i>sur le tapis</i>, or more
generally “on the <i>tapis</i>,” but it does not seem to be at all known in
France. Also servants’ slang. When a domestic is summoned by the
master or mistress to receive a warning or reprimand, he or she is said to
be <span class="smcap lowercase">CARPETED</span>. The corresponding term in commercial establishments is
a <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Wigging">WIGGING</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Carpet-Knight</b>, an habitué of drawing-rooms, a “ladies’ man.”</p>

answer, as&mdash;“How far is it from the first of July to London
Bridge?” “If a bushel of apples cost ten shillings, how long will it
take for an oyster to eat its way through a barrel of soap?”</p>

<p><b>Carrot.</b> “Take a <span class="smcap lowercase">CARROT</span>!” a vulgar insulting phrase.</p>

<div><p><b>Carrots</b>, the coarse and satirical term for red hair. An epigram gives an
illustration of the use of this term:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Why scorn red hair? The Greeks, we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(I note it here in charity)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had taste in beauty, and with them<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The graces were all Χάριται!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of late years <span class="smcap lowercase">CARROTY</span> hair in all its shades has been voted beautiful,
<i>i.e.</i>, fashionable.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Carry Corn</b>, to bear success well and equally. It is said of a man who
breaks down under a sudden access of wealth&mdash;as successful horse-racing
men and unexpected legatees often do&mdash;or who becomes affected
and intolerant, that “he doesn’t <span class="smcap lowercase">CARRY CORN</span> well.”</p>

<p><b>Carry me Out!</b> an exclamation of pretended astonishment on hearing
news too good to be true, or a story too marvellous to be believed.
Sometimes varied by “Let me die,” <i>i.e.</i>, I can’t survive that. Profanely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
derived from the <i>Nunc dimittis</i> (Luke xi. 29). The Irish say,
“<span class="smcap lowercase">CARRY ME OUT</span>, and bury me decently.”</p>

<p><b>Carry-on</b>, to joke a person to excess, to <span class="smcap lowercase">CARRY ON</span> a “spree” too far;
“how we <span class="smcap lowercase">CARRIED ON</span>, to be sure!” <i>i.e.</i>, what fun we had. <i>Nautical
term</i>&mdash;from carrying on sail.</p>

<p><b><a id="Carts"></a>Carts</b>, a pair of shoes. In Norfolk the carapace of a crab is called a <i>crab
cart</i>; hence <span class="smcap lowercase">CARTS</span> would be synonymous with <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Crabshells">CRAB SHELLS</a></span>, which
<i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cart-wheel</b>, a five-shilling piece. Generally condensed to “<span class="smcap lowercase">WHEEL</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Ca-sa</b>, a writ of <i>capias ad satisfaciendam</i>.&mdash;<i>Legal slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Casa</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span>, a house, respectable or otherwise. Probably from the
Italian <span class="smcap lowercase">CASA</span>.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i> The Dutch use the word <span class="smcap lowercase">KAST</span> in a vulgar
sense for a house, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MOTTEKAST</span>, a brothel. <span class="smcap">Case</span> sometimes means
a water-closet, but is in general applied to a “house of accommodation.”
<span class="smcap">Casa</span> is generally pronounced <i>carzey</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cascade</b>, to vomit.</p>

<p><b>Case.</b> Some years ago the term <span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span> was applied generally to persons
or things; “what a <span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span> he is,” <i>i.e.</i>, what a curious person; “a rum
<span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span> that,” or “you are a <span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span>,” both synonymous with the phrase
“odd fish,” common half a century ago. This would seem to have
been originally a “case” for the police-court; drunkenness, &amp;c. Among
young ladies at boarding-schools a <span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span> means a love-affair. <span class="smcap">Case</span>
now means any unfortunate matter. “I’m afraid it’s a <span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span> with him.”</p>

<p><b>Case</b>, a bad crown-piece. <span class="smcap">Half-a-case</span>, a counterfeit half-crown.
There are two sources, either of which may have contributed this
slang term. <span class="smcap">Caser</span> is the Hebrew word for a crown; and silver
coin is frequently counterfeited by coating or <span class="smcap lowercase">CASING</span> pewter or iron
imitations with silver. Possibly from its being “a <span class="smcap lowercase">CASE</span>” with the
unfortunate owner.</p>

<p><b>Cask</b>, fashionable slang for a brougham, or other private carriage. Not
very general. “<span class="smcap">Pillbox</span>” is the more usual term.</p>

<p><b>Cassam</b>, cheese&mdash;not <span class="smcap lowercase">CAFFAN</span>, which Egan, in his edition of <i>Grose</i>, has
ridiculously inserted.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i> <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CASEUS</span>. <i>Gael.</i> and
<i>Irish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CAISE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Cast</b>, to assist by lightening labour. Men in small boats who want to be
towed behind steamers or sailing vessels, say “Give us a <span class="smcap lowercase">CAST</span>.” Also
used by waggoners and others, who sometimes vary the performance
by asking, when stuck on a hill, for a pound, possibly a pound of flesh,
horse or human.</p>

<p><b>Cast up Accounts</b>, to vomit.&mdash;<i>Old.</i></p>

<p><b>Castor</b>, a hat. Mostly used in pugilistic circles. Indeed many hangers-on
of the P.R. have considered that the term arose from the custom of
casting the hat into the ring, before entering oneself. <span class="smcap">Castor</span> was
the <i>Latin</i> name for the animal now known as the <span class="smcap lowercase">BEAVER</span>; and, strange
to add, <span class="smcap lowercase">BEAVER</span> was the slang for <span class="smcap lowercase">CASTOR</span>, or hat, many years ago,
before gossamer came into fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Cat</b>, a lady’s muff; “to free a <span class="smcap lowercase">CAT</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, steal a muff.</p>

for the punishmental whip.</p>

<p><b>Cat and Kitten Sneaking</b>, stealing pint and quart pots and small
pewter spirit measures from public-houses.</p>

much in vogue among “commercial gents.” Now quite out of date.</p>

<p><b>Catchbet</b>, a bet made for the purpose of entrapping the unwary by
means of a paltry subterfuge. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Cherry-colour">CHERRY COLOUR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Catch-em-Alive"></a>Catch-’em-Alive</b>, a humane trap; also a small-tooth comb. A piece
of paper smeared with a sweet sticky substance which is spread about
where flies most abound, and in this sense not particularly humane.
The <span class="smcap lowercase">CATCH-’EM-ALIVE</span> trap for rats and other such animals is humane
compared with the gin trap.</p>

<p><b>Catch-penny</b>, any temporary contrivance to obtain money from the
public; penny shows, or cheap exhibitions. Also descriptions of
murders which have never taken place.</p>

North of England.</p>

<p><b>Catgut-Scraper</b>, a fiddler.</p>

<p><b>Cat-in-the-Pan</b>, a traitor, a turncoat&mdash;derived by some from the
<i>Greek</i>, καταπαν, altogether; or&mdash;and more likely&mdash;from <i>cake in pan</i>,
a pan-cake, which is frequently turned from side to side.</p>

<p><b>Cat-lap</b>, a contemptuous expression for weak drink. Anything a cat will
drink is very innocuous.</p>

<p><b>Cats and Dogs.</b> It is said to rain cats and dogs when a shower is
exceptionally heavy. Probably in ridicule of the remarkable showers
which used to find their way into the papers during the “silly season.”</p>

<p><b>Cat’s-meat</b>, a coarse term for the lungs&mdash;the “lights” or lungs of
animals being usually sold to feed cats.</p>

<p><b>Cat’s-paw</b>, a dupe or tool. From the old story of the monkey who

<p><b>Caucus</b>, a private meeting held for the purpose of concerting measures,
agreeing upon candidates for office before an election, &amp;c. This is an
American term, and a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">CAULKER’S MEETING</span>, being
derived from an association of the shipping interest at Boston, previous
to the War of Independence, who were very active in getting up opposition
to England.&mdash;<i>See Pickering’s Vocabulary.</i></p>

glass of grog&mdash;preferably brandy&mdash;finishing the potations of the evening.
<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Whitewash">WHITEWASH</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Caulker</b>, a too marvellous story, a lie. <span class="smcap">Choker</span> has the same sense.</p>

<p><b>Caution</b>, anything out of the common way. “He’s a <span class="smcap lowercase">CAUTION</span>,” is
said of an obdurate or argumentative man. The phrase is also used
in many ways in reference to places and things.</p>

<p><b>Cavaulting</b>, a vulgar phrase equivalent to “horsing.” The <i>Italian</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAVALLINO</span>, signifies a rake or debauchee.&mdash;<i>Lingua Franca</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CAVOLTA</span>.
From this comes the Americanism “cavorting,” running or riding

<p><b>Chaffer</b>, the mouth; “moisten your <span class="smcap lowercase">CHAFFER</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, take something to
drink.</p>

score for drink behind the bar-doors of public-houses.</p>

<p><b><a id="Chalks"></a>Chalks</b>, “to walk one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">CHALKS</span>,” to move off, or run away. An ordeal

“Making <span class="smcap lowercase">CHALKS</span>” is a term connected with the punishment of boys
on board ship, and in the Naval School at Greenwich. Two chalk
lines are drawn wide apart on the deck or floor, and the boy to be
punished places a foot on each of these lines, and stoops, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
presenting a convenient portion of his person to the boatswain or

<p><b>Chancery</b>, a pugilistic phrase for difficulties; “to get a man’s head into
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHANCERY</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, to get an opponent’s head firmly under one’s arm,
where it can be pommelled with immense power, and without any
possibility of immediate extrication. From the helplessness of a suitor
in Chancery. This opportunity was of very rare occurrence when the
combatants were at all evenly matched.</p>

<p><b>Change</b>, small money. The overplus returned after paying for a thing
in a round sum. Hence a slang expression used when a person

Churchyard, or other public spot. Strange as it may appear, there
are actually two men in London at the present day who gain their
living in this way. Very recently they were singing before the establishment
of a fashionable tailor in Regent Street; and not long since
they were bawling their doggrel rhymes outside the mansion of a
Norfolk M.P., in Belgravia.<a name="Anchor-57" id="Anchor-57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a></p>

America a man who is dead is said to have handed (or passed) in his
checks. The gamblers there are responsible for many of the colloquialisms
current.</p>

<p><b>Chee-Chee</b>, this word is used in a rather offensive manner to denote
Eurasians,<a name="Anchor-58" id="Anchor-58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> or children by an English father and native mother. It
takes its origin in a very common expression of half-caste females,
“<span class="smcap">Chee-chee</span>,” equivalent to our Oh, fie!&mdash;Nonsense!&mdash;For shame!&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Cheek</b>, share or portion; “where’s my <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEEK</span>?” where is my allowance?
“All to his own <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEEK</span>,” all to himself.</p>

<p><b>Cheek</b>, to irritate by impudence, to accuse.</p>

that their faces almost touch.</p>

<p><b><a id="Cheese"></a>Cheese</b>, anything good, first-rate in quality, genuine, pleasant, or advantageous,
is termed the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESE</span>. The <i>London Guide</i>, 1818, says it was
from some young fellows translating “c’est une autre <span class="smcap lowercase">CHOSE</span>” into
“that is another <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESE</span>.” But the expression <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESE</span> may be found
in the Gipsy vocabulary, and in the Hindostanee and Persian languages.
In the last <span class="smcap lowercase">CHIZ</span> means a thing&mdash;that is the thing, <i>i.e.</i>, the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Cheese</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESE IT</span> (evidently a corruption of <i>cease</i>), leave off, or have
done; “<span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESE</span> your barrikin,” hold your noise. Term very common.</p>

<p><b>Cheesecutter</b>, a prominent and aquiline nose. Also a large square
peak to a cap. Caps fitted with square peaks are called cheesecutter
caps.</p>

<p><b><a id="Cheesemongers"></a>Cheesemongers</b>, once a popular name for the First Lifeguards. Until
the Peninsular War the First Lifeguards, from their almost exclusive
service at home, were nicknamed <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESEMONGERS</span>. This term then
fell into desuetude; but at Waterloo the commanding officer of the
regiment had not forgotten it, and when leading his men to the charge,
called out, “Come on, you damned <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEESEMONGERS</span>!” an invitation
complied with so readily, that the title was restored, with the difference
that it was no longer a word of reproach.</p>

<p><b>Cheesy</b>, fine or showy. The opposite of “dusty.”</p>

<p><b>Cherry-bums</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CHERUBIMS</span>, a nickname given to the 11th Hussars,

<p><b><a id="Cherry-colour"></a>Cherry-colour</b>, either red or black, as you wish; a term used in a
cheating trick at cards. When the cards are being dealt, a knowing
one offers to bet that he will tell the colour of the turn-up card.
“Done!” says Mr. Green. The sum being named, Mr. Sharp affirms
that it will be <span class="smcap lowercase">CHERRY-COLOUR</span>; and as cherries are either black or
red, he wins, leaving his victim a wiser man, it is to be hoped, and
not a <i>better</i> for the future. It may be as well for the habitually unfortunate
to know that wagers of this kind are not recoverable even
according to the sporting code, which disacknowledges all kinds of
catch-bets.</p>

<p><b>Cherry-merry</b>, a present of money. <span class="smcap">Cherry-merry-bamboo</span>, a
beating.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

in some places their heads alone are visible.</p>

<p><b>Cheshire Cat</b>, to grin like a <span class="smcap lowercase">CHESHIRE CAT</span>, to display the teeth and
gums when laughing. Formerly the phrase was “to grin like a
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHESHIRE CAT</span> eating cheese.” A hardly satisfactory explanation has
been given of this phrase&mdash;that Cheshire is a county palatine, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
cats, when they think of it, are so tickled with the notion that they
can’t help grinning.<a name="Anchor-59" id="Anchor-59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a></p>

<p><b>Chill</b>, to warm, as beer. This at first seems like reversing the order of

draught</i>.</p>

<p><b>Chin-chin</b>, a salutation, a compliment.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

<p><b>Chitterlings</b>, the shirt frills once fashionable and worn still by ancient

Perhaps from <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEVAULCHER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Chive</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CHIVEY</span>, a shout, a halloo, or cheer; loud tongued. Probably
from <span class="smcap lowercase"><a id="CHEVY-CHASE"></a>CHEVY-CHASE</span>, a boy’s game, in which the word <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEVY</span> is bawled
aloud. Dickens uses the word <span class="smcap lowercase">CHIVEY</span> in <i>Bleak House</i> rather freely,
but there it is from the other phase of <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEVY-CHASE</span> which follows.</p>

<p><b>Chive</b>, a knife; also used as a verb, to knife. In all these cases the word
is pronounced as though written <span class="smcap lowercase">CHIV</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">CHIVVY</span>.</p>

<i>Massinger</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CHIAUS</span>. From the <i>Turkish</i>, in which language it signifies
an interpreter. <i>Gifford</i> gives a curious story as to its origin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the year 1609 there was attached to the Turkish embassy in England an Interpreter,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">CHIAOUS</span>, who, by cunning, aided by his official position, managed
to cheat the Turkish and Persian merchants, then in London, out of the large
sum of £4000, then deemed an enormous amount. From the notoriety which
attended the fraud, and the magnitude of the swindle, any one who cheated or
defrauded was said to <i>chiaous</i>, or <i>chause</i>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CHOUSE</span>; to do, that is, as this
<i>Chiaous</i> had done.”&mdash;<i>See Trench, Eng. Past and Present.</i></p></div>
</div>

<div><p><span class="smcap">Chiaus</span>, according to <i>Sandys</i> (<i>Travels</i>, p. 48), is “one who goes on
embassies, executes commandments,” &amp;c. The particular Chiaus in
question is alluded to in <i>Ben Jonson’s Alchymist</i>, 1610.</p>

This term seems to have gone out of fashion with the custom which
gave rise to it.</p>

soda with a <span class="smcap lowercase">CINDER</span> in it.” The cinder may be sherry, brandy, or any

men he who has arranged his wagerings so satisfactorily before an
event that he cannot possibly lose, and may win a good deal, is said to

also said to be in clover.</p>

<p><b>Club</b>, in manœuvring troops, so to blunder in giving the word of command
that the soldiers get into a position from which they cannot extricate

general.</p>

<p><b>Clump</b>, to strike, to beat.&mdash;<i>Prov.</i></p>

<p><b>Cly</b>, a pocket.&mdash;<i>Old Cant</i> for to steal. A correspondent derives this word
from the <i>Old English</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CLEYES</span>, claws; <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CLEA</span>. This pronunciation

<p><b>Coal</b>, money; “post the <span class="smcap lowercase">COAL</span>,” put down the money. The phrase was
used by Mr. Buckstone at the Theatrical Fund Dinner of 1863. From
this is derived the theatrical term <span class="smcap lowercase">COALING</span>, profitable, very good,
which an actor will use if his part is full of good and telling speeches&mdash;thus,
“my part is full of <span class="smcap lowercase">COALING</span> lines.” This term was used in the
sporting world long anterior to Mr. Buckstone’s speech. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">COAL</span>.</p>

<p><b>Coals</b>, “to haul (or pull) over the <span class="smcap lowercase">COALS</span>,” to take to task, to scold. Supposed

<i>See</i> Grose and Captain Marryat’s novels. A hand-saw is the
general instrument of punishment.</p>

<p><b>Cock</b>, a familiar term of address; “jolly old <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>,” a jovial fellow, “how
are you, old <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>?” Frequently rendered nowadays, <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK-E-E</span>, a
vulgar street salutation&mdash;probably a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK-EYE</span>. The latter
is frequently heard as a shout or street cry after a man or boy.</p>

<p><b>Cock</b>, a smoking term; “<span class="smcap lowercase">COCKING</span> a Broseley,” <i>i.e.</i>, smoking a pipe.
Broseley in Shropshire is famous for “churchwardens.” A “<span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
is an apocryphal story, generally, of a murder or elopement bawled
about the streets by the Seven Dials’ “patterers.”</p>

<p><b>Cock</b>, a pugilistic term for a man who is knocked out of time. “Knocked
him a reg’lar <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>.” Sometimes used to signify knocked out of shape,
as, “Knocked him <span class="smcap lowercase">A-COCK</span>,” probably connected with “cocked-hat
shape.” A horse who has been backed by the public, but who does
not run, or, running, does not persevere.</p>

<p><b>Cock</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span> your eye,” to shut or wink one eye, to make “sheep’s-eyes.”</p>

<p><b>Cock-a-hoop</b>, in high spirits. Possibly the idea is from the fact that,
if a cock wins a fight, he will mount on anything near, and crow lustily
and jubilantly. It is noticeable that under these circumstances a cock
always gets off the ground-level if he can.</p>

<p><b>Cockalorum</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKYLORUM</span>, amplification of cock or cocky.</p>

<p><b>Cock and bull story</b>, a long, rambling anecdote.&mdash;<i>See</i> Peroration
to <i>Tristram Shandy</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cock-and-hen-club</b>, a free and easy gathering, or “sing-song,”
where females are admitted as well as males.</p>

<p><b>Cock-and-pinch</b>, the old-fashioned beaver hat, affected by “swells”
and “sporting gents” forty years ago&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">COCKED</span> back and front, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">PINCHED</span> up at the sides.</p>

<p><b>Cock-a-wax</b>, an amplification of the simple term <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>, sometimes
“Lad of <span class="smcap lowercase">WAX</span>,” originally applied to a cobbler, but now general.</p>

<p><b>Cocked-hat-club</b>, the principal clique amongst the members of the
Society of Antiquaries, who virtually decide whether any person proposed
shall be admitted or not. The term comes from the “cocked-hat”
placed before the president at the sittings. There was another
cocked-hat club in London not many years back, which had nothing
peculiar about it beyond the fact that every member wore during club
sittings, a “fore-and-aft” cocked-hat. Otherwise the proceedings were
of the most ordinary kind.</p>

<p><b>Cocked-hat-shaped</b>, shapeless: Anything which has been altered
beyond recognition, or any man who has been put completely <i>hors de
combat</i>, is said to have been knocked into a <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKED-HAT</span>.</p>

<p><b>Cocker</b>, “It is all right, according to Cocker,” meaning that everything
has been done in accordance with the present system of figures. The
phrase refers to the celebrated writing-master of Charles II.’s time,
whose Arithmetic, Dictionary, &amp;c., were long the standard authorities.
The Arithmetic was first published in 1677-8, and, though it reached
more than sixty editions, is considered a very scarce book. Professor
de Morgan says that the main goodness of Cocker’s <i>Tutor</i> consists in his
adopting the abbreviated system of division; and suggests that it
became a proverbial representative of arithmetic from Murphy’s farce
of <i>The Apprentice</i>, 1756, in which the strong point of the old merchant,
Wingate, is his extreme reverence for Cocker and his arithmetic. A
curious fact may here be mentioned in connexion with this saying. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
been stated, and very well proved, that many words popular in Shakspeare’s
time, and now obsolete in this country, are still in every-day
use in the older English settlements of North America. The original
compiler of this work was surprised, when travelling through Western
Canada, to find that, instead of the renowned Cocker, the people appealed
to another and more learned authority. “According to
Gunter,” is a phrase in continual Transatlantic use. This scientific
worthy invented the sector in 1606; and in 1623, about the time of
the great Puritan exodus to North America, he brought out his famous
<i>Rule of Proportion</i>. This was popularly known as Gunter’s Proportion,
or <i>Gunter’s Line</i>, and the term soon became a vulgar standard of
appeal in cases of doubt or dispute.</p>

<p><b>Cock-eye</b>, a term of opprobrium often applied to one that squints.</p>

<p><b>Cockles</b>, “to rejoice the <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKLES</span> of one’s heart,” a vulgar phrase
implying great pleasure. Also, to “warm one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKLES</span>,” said of any
hot, well-spiced drink, taken in cold weather. <span class="smcap">Cockles</span> altogether
seem to be an imaginary portion&mdash;of great importance&mdash;in the internal
economy of the human frame.</p>

<p><b>Cockney</b>, a native of London. Originally, a spoilt or effeminate boy,
derived from <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKERING</span>, or foolishly petting a person, rendering him
of soft and luxurious manners. Halliwell states, in his admirable essay
upon the word, that “some writers trace the word with much probability
to the imaginary land of <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKAYGNE</span>, the lubber land of the
olden times.” Grose gives Minsheu’s absurd but comical derivation:&mdash;A
citizen of London being in the country, and hearing a horse neigh,
exclaimed, “Lord! how that horse laughs!” A bystander informed
him that the noise was called neighing. The next morning when the
cock crowed, the citizen, to show that he had not forgotten what was
told him, cried out, “Do you hear how the <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK NEIGHS</span>?”&mdash;<i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Mares_nest">MARE’S NEST</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Cock of the walk</b>, a master spirit, head of a party. Places where
poultry are fed are called <span class="smcap lowercase">WALKS</span>, and the barn door cocks invariably
fight for the supremacy till one has obtained it. At schools where this
phrase was originally much used, it has been diminished to “<span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>”
only.</p>

<p><b>Cock one’s toes</b>, to die. Otherwise “turn-up one’s toes.”</p>

<p><b>Cock-robin shop</b>, a small printing-office, where cheap and nasty
work is done and low wages are paid.</p>

<p><b>Cocks</b>, fictitious narratives, in verse or prose, of murders, fires, and
terrible accidents, sold in the streets as true accounts. The man who
hawks them, a patterer, often changes the scene of the awful event to
suit the taste of the neighbourhood he is trying to delude. Possibly a
corruption of <i>cook</i>, a cooked statement, or maybe “the story of a cock
and a bull” may have had something to do with the term. Improvements
in newspapers, especially in those published in the evening,
and increased scepticism on the part of the public, have destroyed this
branch of a once-flourishing business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="Cockshy"></a>Cockshy</b>, a game at fairs and races, where trinkets are set upon sticks,
and for one penny three throws at them are accorded, the thrower
keeping whatever he knocks off. From the ancient game of throwing
or “shying” at live cocks. Any prominent person abused in the
newspapers is said to be a common <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKSHY</span>.</p>

<p><b>Cocksure</b>, certain.</p>

<p><b>Cocky</b>, pert, saucy.</p>

<p><b>Cocoa-nut</b>, the head. A pugilistic term. Also, when anything is
explained to a man for the first time, it is not unusual for him to say,
“Ah, that accounts for the milk in the cocoa-nut”&mdash;a remark which
has its origin in a clever but not very moral story.</p>

<p><b>Cocum</b>, shrewdness, ability, luck; “Jack’s got <span class="smcap lowercase">COCUM</span>, he’s safe to get
on, he is,”&mdash;viz., he starts under favourable circumstances; “to fight
<span class="smcap lowercase">COCUM</span>” is to be wily and cautious. Allied perhaps to the Scottish <span class="smcap lowercase">KEEK</span>,
<i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GUCKEN</span>, to peep or pry into.</p>

<p><b>Cod</b>, to hoax, to take a “rise” out of one. Used as a noun, a fool.</p>

<p><b>Coddam</b>, a public-house game, much affected by medical students and
cabmen, generally three on each side. The game is “simplicity itself,”
but requires a great amount of low cunning and peculiar mental ingenuity.
It consists in guessing in which of the six hands displayed on
the table, a small piece of marked money lies hid. If the guesser
“brings it home,” his side takes the “piece,” and the centre man
“works” it. If the guess is wrong, a chalk is taken to the holders, who
again secrete the coin. Great fun is to be obtained from this game
when it is properly played.</p>

<p><b>Codds</b>, the “poor brethren” of the Charter House. In <i>The Newcomes</i>,
Thackeray writes, “The Cistercian lads call these old gentlemen <span class="smcap lowercase">CODDS</span>;
I know not wherefore.” A probable abbreviation of <span class="smcap lowercase">CODGER</span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Codger"></a>Codger</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">COGER</span>, an old man; “a rum old <span class="smcap lowercase">CODGER</span>,” a curious old fellow.
<span class="smcap">Codger</span> is sometimes used as synonymous with <span class="smcap lowercase">CADGER</span>, and
then signifies a person who gets his living in a questionable manner.
“<span class="smcap">Cogers</span>,” the name of a debating society, formerly held in Shoe
Lane, Fleet Street, and still in existence. The term is probably a
corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">COGITATORS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Coffee-Shop</b>, a watercloset, or house of office.</p>

<p><b>Cog</b>, to cheat at dice.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i> Also, to agree with, as one cog-wheel
does with another, to crib from another’s book, as schoolboys
often do. This is called “cogging over.”</p>

<p><b>Cogged</b>, loaded like false dice. Any one who has been hocussed or
cheated is sometimes said to have been <span class="smcap lowercase">COGGED</span>.</p>

<p><b>Coin</b>, “to post the <span class="smcap lowercase">COIN</span>”&mdash;sometimes “post the coal”&mdash;a sporting
phrase meaning to make a deposit of money for a match of any kind.</p>

<p><b>Cold blood</b>, a house licensed for the sale of beer “<span class="smcap lowercase">NOT</span> to be drunk on
the premises.”</p>

<p><b>Cold coffee</b>, misfortune; sometimes varied to <span class="smcap lowercase">COLD GRUEL</span>. An unpleasant
return for a proffered kindness is sometimes called <span class="smcap lowercase">COLD
COFFEE</span>.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Cold coffee</b>, an Oxford synonym for a “<a href="#Sell">sell</a>,” which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cold cook</b>, an undertaker. Cold cook’s shop, an undertaker’s.</p>

<p><b>Cold meat</b>, a corpse. <span class="smcap">Cold-meat box</span>, a coffin.</p>

<p><b>Cold meat train</b>, the last train at night by which officers can reach
Aldershot per South Western Railway. So called because by this
train corpses are often conveyed on account of the Necropolis
Company to Woking.</p>

<p><b>Cold shoulder</b>, “to show or give any one the <span class="smcap lowercase">COLD SHOULDER</span>” is to
“cut” in a modified form, to assume a distant manner towards anybody,
to evince a desire to cease acquaintanceship. Sometimes termed
“<span class="smcap lowercase">COLD SHOULDER</span> of mutton.”</p>

<p><b>Colfabias</b>, a Latinized Irish phrase signifying the closet of decency,
applied as a slang term to a place of resort in Trinity College, Dublin.</p>

<p><b>Collar</b>, “out of <span class="smcap lowercase">COLLAR</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, out of place, no work. Probably a variation
of the metaphorical expressions, “in, or out of harness,” <i>i.e.</i>, in
or out of work&mdash;the horse being in collar when harnessed for his work.
<span class="smcap">Collar</span> work is any very hard work, from the expression among drivers.
Any uphill journey is said to be all “<span class="smcap lowercase">COLLAR</span> work” for the horses.</p>

<p><b>Collar</b>, to seize, to lay hold of. Thieves’ slang, <i>i.e.</i>, to steal.</p>

<p><b>Collar and elbow</b>, a term for a peculiar style of wrestling&mdash;the
Cornwall and Devon style.</p>

<p><b>Collections</b>, the College examinations at the end of each term, when
undergraduates wear white ties and bands, and are trotted through
the subjects of the term’s lecture. These are the occasions when the
dons administer reproof or advice on the conduct of each individual
undergrad.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Collogue</b>, to conspire, talk mysteriously together in low tones, plot
mischief. Connected with “colloquy” or “colleague.” Maybe mixture
of both.</p>

<p><b>Colly-wobbles</b>, the stomach-ache, a person’s bowels,&mdash;supposed by
many to be the seat of feeling and nutrition.&mdash;<i>Devonshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Colour</b>, complexion, tint; “I’ve not seen the <span class="smcap lowercase">COLOUR</span> of his money,” <i>i.e.</i>,
he has never paid me any. In fortune-telling by cards, a <i>diamond
colour</i> is the fairest; <i>heart-colour</i>, fair, but not so fair as the last; <i>club
colour</i>, rather dark; <i>spade colour</i>, an extremely swarthy complexion.</p>

<p><b><a id="Colour"></a>Colour</b>, a handkerchief worn by each of the supporters of a professional
athlete on the day of a match, so as to distinguish them from the
partizans of the other side. The professional chooses his colours, and
his backers, and as many of the general public as can be persuaded to
do so, take one each to wear on the eventful day, the understanding
being that the man is to be paid, say, a guinea if he wins, and nothing
if he loses. Some of these handkerchiefs used to be, in the palmy days
of pugilism and professional rowing on the Thames, very fine
specimens of work; but as their purveyors expected to be paid whether
they won or lost, and as the price was generally about four times the
intrinsic value, colours are rather shyly dealt with now. The
custom is, however, a very ancient one, and such men as Tom
Sayers, Tom King, Harry Kelley, and Bob Chambers have, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in these degenerate days, received very large sums for their winning
colours.</p>

<p><b>Colt</b>, a murderous weapon, formed by slinging a small shot to the end of a
rather stiff piece of rope. It is the original of the misnamed “life-preserver.”</p>

<p><b>Colt</b>, a person who sits as juryman for the first time. In Cork an
operative baker who does not belong to the union.</p>

<p><b>Colt</b>, a professional cricketer during his first season. From the best colts
in the annual match are selected new county players.</p>

<p><b>Colt</b>, to fine a new juryman a sum to be spent in drink, by way of “wetting”
his office; to make a person free of a new place, which is done
by his standing treat, and submitting to be struck on the sole of the
foot with a piece of board.</p>

<p><b>Colt’s tooth</b>, elderly persons of juvenile tastes are said to have a <span class="smcap lowercase">COLT’S
TOOTH</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, a desire to shed their teeth once more, to see life over
again.</p>

<p><b><a id="Comb-cut"></a>Comb-cut</b>, mortified, disgraced, “down on one’s luck.”&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Cut">CUT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Come"></a>Come</b>, a slang verb used in many phrases; “Aint he <span class="smcap lowercase">COMING IT</span>?” <i>i.e.</i>, is
he not proceeding at a great rate? “Don’t <span class="smcap lowercase">COME TRICKS</span> here,”
“don’t <span class="smcap lowercase">COME THE OLD SOLDIER</span> over me,” <i>i.e.</i>, we are aware of your
practices, and “twig” your manœuvre. <span class="smcap">Coming it strong</span>, exaggerating,
going ahead, the opposite of “drawing it mild.” <span class="smcap">Coming it</span>
also means informing or disclosing. Also, in pugilistic phraseology,
to <span class="smcap lowercase">COME IT</span> means to show fear; and in this respect, as well as in
that of giving information, the expression “<span class="smcap lowercase">COME IT</span>” is best known to
the lower and most dangerous classes.</p>

<p><b>Come down</b>, to pay down.</p>

<p><b>Commemoration</b>, the end of Lent term at Oxford, when honorary
degrees are conferred and certain prizes given, and when men have
friends “up.”</p>

<div><p><b><a id="Commission"></a>Commission</b>, a shirt.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i> <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CAMICIA</span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Concaves"></a>Concaves and convexes</b>, a pack of cards contrived
for cheating, by cutting all the cards from the
two to the seven concave, and all from the eight to the king convex.
Then by cutting the pack breadthwise a convex card is cut, and by
cutting it lengthwise a concave is secured.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Longs-and-shorts">LONGS AND SHORTS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Conjee</b>, a kind of gruel made of rice.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Conk</b>, a nose. Possibly from the <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CONCHA</span>, a shell. <i>Greek</i>, κόγχη&mdash;hence
anything hollow. Somewhat of a parallel may be found in the
<i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TESTA</span>, an earthenware pot, a shell, and in later <i>Latin</i>, a
<i>skull</i>; from whence the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">TESTE</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">TÊTE</span>, head. <span class="smcap">Conky</span>,
having a projecting or remarkable nose. The first Duke of
Wellington was frequently termed “Old <span class="smcap">Conky</span>” in satirical papers

British Army.</p>

price.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

<p><b>Constable</b>, “to overrun the <span class="smcap lowercase">CONSTABLE</span>,” to exceed one’s income, or get

accommodating a buyer or seller, by carrying the engagement to pay
money or deliver shares over to the next account day.</p>

<p><b>Continuations</b>, coverings for the legs, whether trousers or breeches. A

<p><b>Conveyancer</b>, a pickpocket. Shakspeare uses the cant expression <span class="smcap lowercase">CONVEYER</span>,
a thief. The same term is also French slang.</p>

<p><b>Cooey</b>, the Australian bush-call, now not unfrequently heard in the
streets of London.</p>

<p><b><a id="Cook"></a>Cook</b>, a term well known in the Bankruptcy Courts, in reference to
accounts that have been meddled with, or <span class="smcap lowercase">COOKED</span>, by the bankrupt;
also to form a balance-sheet from general trade inferences; stated by a

<p><b><a id="Coon"></a>Coon</b>, abbreviation of racoon.&mdash;<i>American.</i> A <span class="smcap lowercase">GONE COON</span>&mdash;<i>ditto</i>, one in
an awful fix, past praying for. This expression is said to have originated
in the first American war with a spy, who dressed himself in a
racoon skin, and ensconced himself in a tree. An English rifleman
taking him for a veritable coon, levelled his piece at him, upon which
he exclaimed, “Don’t shoot, I’ll come down of myself, I know I’m a
<span class="smcap lowercase">GONE COON</span>.” The Yankees say the Britisher was so “flummuxed,” that
he flung down his rifle and “made tracks” for home. The phrase is
pretty general in England. [There is one difficulty about this story&mdash;How
big was the man who dressed himself in a racoon skin?]</p>

<p><b>Cooper</b>, “stout half-and-half,” <i>i.e.</i>, half stout and half porter. Derived

to <i>catch</i> in the phrase “to <span class="smcap lowercase">COP</span> (or catch) a beating.” “To get <span class="smcap lowercase">COPT</span>,”

simply laying logs along a clearing.</p>

<div><p><b>Corinthianism</b>, a term derived from the classics, much in vogue some
years ago, implying pugilism, high life, “sprees,” roystering, &amp;c.&mdash;Shakspeare,
1 <i>Hen. IV.</i> ii. 4. The immorality of <i>Corinth</i> was proverbial
in Greece. Κορινθιάζεσθαι, to <i>Corinthianize</i>, indulge in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
company of courtezans, was a Greek slang expression. Hence the

expressive kind, denoting the means of “keeping afloat.”</p>

<p><b>Corned</b>, drunk or intoxicated. Possibly from soaking or pickling oneself
like <span class="smcap lowercase">CORNED</span> beef.</p>

<p><b>Corner</b>, “the <span class="smcap lowercase">CORNER</span>,” Tattersall’s famous horse repository and betting
rooms, so called from the fact of its situation, which was at Hyde Park
Corner. Though Tattersall’s has been removed some distance, to
Albert Gate, it is still known to the older habitués of the Subscription
Room as “the <span class="smcap lowercase">CORNER</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Cornered</b>, hemmed in a corner, placed in a position from which there
is no escape.</p>

<p><b>Corner-man</b>, the end singer of a corps of Ethiopian or nigger minstrels.
There are two corner men, one generally plays the bones and the

materials for a dinner, &amp;c., or a good supply of money. Its origin is of
course Biblical.</p>

<div><p><b>Costermonger</b>, a street seller of fish, fruit, vegetables, poultry, &amp;c.
The London costermongers number more than 30,000. They form a
distinct class, occupying whole neighbourhoods, and were at one time
cut off from the rest of metropolitan society by their low habits, general
improvidence, pugnacity, love of gambling, total want of education,
disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar
slang language. They have changed a good deal of this, though,
now. <span class="smcap">Costermonger</span> <i>aliter</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">COSTARDMONGER</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, an apple-seller.
In Nares’s <i>Glossary</i> (Ed. H. &amp; W.) they are said to have been frequently
Irish. So, Ben Jonson&mdash;</p>

the sporting press engaged in that locality.</p>

<p><b>Council-of-ten</b>, the toes of a man who turns his feet inward.</p>

<p><b>Counter</b>, to hit back, to exchange blows. A cross <span class="smcap lowercase">COUNTER</span> is a blow with
the right hand given in exchange for one with the left, the counterer
preferring to strike rather than to “stop” the blow.&mdash;<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>

<p><b>Counter-jumper</b>, a shopman, a draper’s assistant.</p>

A favourite breakfast dish with the captains of country-ships.&mdash;<i>Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Country-ship</b>, a ship belonging to the East Indies, and trading from
port to port in that country.</p>

<p><b>County-crop</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">COUNTY-PRISON CROP</span>), haircut close and round, as
if guided by a basin&mdash;an indication of having been in prison. Since
short hair has become fashionable the expression has fallen somewhat
into disuse. In the times when long hair was worn, a man with his
hair cut as described was said to have had it done with a knife and
fork.</p>

<span class="smcap lowercase">COVE</span>,” a “downy <span class="smcap lowercase">COVE</span>,” &amp;c. The feminine, <span class="smcap lowercase">COVESS</span>, was once
popular, but it has fallen into disuse. Originally ancient cant (temp.
Henry VII.), <span class="smcap lowercase">COFE</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CUFFIN</span>, altered in Decker’s time to <span class="smcap lowercase">COVE</span>. <i>See</i>

signifies a lout or awkward fellow. Amongst Negroes, <span class="smcap lowercase">CUFFEE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Coventry</b>, “to send a man to <span class="smcap lowercase">COVENTRY</span>,” not to speak to or notice
him. Coventry was one of those towns in which the privilege of
practising most trades was anciently confined to certain privileged
persons, as the freemen, &amp;c. Hence a stranger stood little chance of
custom, or countenance, and “to send a man to <span class="smcap lowercase">COVENTRY</span>” came to
be equivalent to putting him out of the pale of society.</p>

<p><b><a id="Cover-down"></a>Cover-down</b>, a tossing coin with a false cover, enabling either head or
tail to be shown, according as the cover is left on or taken off. The

machinery is a sorry rogue.</p>

<p><b>Cowan</b>, a sneak, an inquisitive or prying person. <i>Greek</i>, κύων, a dog.
Term given by Freemasons to all uninitiated persons. Used in
Anderson’s <i>Constitutions</i>, edit. 1769, p. 97. If derived from κύων,
its use was probably suggested by such passages in the N. T. as Matt.
vii. 6, and Phil. iii. 2. The Moslems apply dog in a similar manner.
It is probably Oriental. Other authorities say it is from <span class="smcap lowercase">COWAN</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">KIRWAN</span>, a Scottish word signifying a man who builds rough stone
walls without mortar&mdash;a man who, though he builds, is not a practical
mason.</p>

Of course it is easy to get one’s buttery commons out in some one else’s

<p><b>Cure</b>, an odd person; a contemptuous term, abridged from <span class="smcap lowercase">CURIOSITY</span>,
which was formerly the favourite expression. The word cure, as
originally applied, was London street slang, and was, as just stated,
an abbreviation of curiosity, or, more correctly, of curious or queer
fellow. Of late years it has, however, been used to denote a funny,
humorous person, who can give and receive chaff.</p>

<p><b>Curios</b>, a corruption of “curiosities;” any articles of vertu brought

<p>The expression “not worth a <span class="smcap lowercase">CURSE</span>,” used frequently nowadays, is
therefore not properly profane, though it is frequently intensified by a

expression “not worth a tinker’s <span class="smcap lowercase">CURSE</span>,” may or may not have arisen
from misapplication of the word’s origin, though as now used it
certainly means curse in its usual sense. Tinkers do curse, unfortunately,
and it will take a good deal of school-board work to educate them out
of it, as well as a fair amount of time. The phrase “not worth a
tinker’s damn,” is evidently a variation of this, unless indeed it should
be spelt “dam,” and used as a reference to the general worthlessness
of the wives and mothers of tinkers. This latter is merely offered
to those who are speculative in such matters, and is not advanced as
an opinion.</p>

<p><b>Curse of Scotland</b>, the Nine of Diamonds. Various hypotheses
have been set up as to this appellation&mdash;that it was the card on which
the “Butcher Duke” wrote a cruel order with respect to the rebels
after the battle of Culloden; that the diamonds are the nine lozenges
in the arms of Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, detested for his share in the
Massacre of Glencoe; that it is a corruption of Cross of Scotland, the
nine diamonds being arranged somewhat after the fashion of a St.
Andrew’s Cross. The first supposition is evidently erroneous, for in
Dr. Houston’s Memoirs of his own Lifetime, 1747, p. 92, the Jacobite
ladies are stated to have nicknamed the Nine of Diamonds “the Justice
Clerk,” after the rebellion of 1715, in allusion to the Lord Justice-Clerk
Ormistone, who, for his severity in suppressing it, was called
the Curse of Scotland. Gules a cross of lozenges were also the arms
of Colonel Packer, who attended Charles I. on the scaffold, and commanded
in Scotland afterwards with great severity.&mdash;<i>See</i> Chatto on the
<i>Origin and History of Playing Cards</i>, p. 267. The most probable
explanation is, that in the game of Pope Joan the nine of diamonds
is the <span class="smcap lowercase">POPE</span>, of whom the Scotch have an especial horror.</p>

<p><b>Curtail</b>, to cut off. Originally a Cant word&mdash;vide <i>Hudibras</i>, and <i>Bacchus

the bride at a wedding.</p>

<p><b>Daddy;</b> at mock raffles, lotteries, &amp;c., the <span class="smcap lowercase">DADDY</span> is an accomplice, most
commonly the getter-up of the swindle, and in all cases the person
that has been previously selected to win the prize.</p>

<p><b>Daddy</b>, the old man in charge&mdash;generally an aged pauper&mdash;at casual
wards. Most people will remember “kind old <span class="smcap lowercase">DADDY</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Daffy</b>, gin. A term with monthly nurses, who are always extolling the
virtues of Daffy’s Elixir, and who occasionally comfort themselves
with a stronger medicine under Daffy’s name. Of late years the term
has been altered to “soothing syrup.”</p>

<p><b>Dags</b>, feat or performance; “I’ll do your <span class="smcap lowercase">DAGS</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, I will do something

<p><b>Daisy-cutter</b>, a horse that trots or gallops without lifting its feet much
from the ground.</p>

<p><b>Daisy-kicker</b>, the name ostlers at large inns used to give each other,
now nearly obsolete. <span class="smcap">Daisy-kicker</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">GROGHAM</span>, was likewise the
cant term for a horse. The <span class="smcap lowercase">DAISY-KICKERS</span> were sad rogues in the old
posting days; frequently the landlords rented the stables to them,
as the only plan to make them return a profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Damage</b>, in the sense of recompense; “what’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">DAMAGE</span>?” <i>i.e.</i>, what

<p><b>Dando</b>, a great eater, who cheats at hotels, eating shops, oyster-cellars,
&amp;c., from a person of that name who lived many years ago, and who was
an enormous oyster-eater. According to the stories related of him,
Dando would visit an oyster-room, devour an almost fabulous quantity
of bivalves, with porter and bread and butter to match, and then
calmly state that he had no money.</p>

<p><b>Dandy</b>, a fop, or fashionable nondescript. This word, in the sense of a
fop, is of modern origin. Egan says it was first used in 1820, and Bee
in 1816. Johnson does not mention it, although it is to be found in
all late dictionaries. <span class="smcap">Dandies</span> wore stays, studied a feminine style,
and tried to undo their manhood by all manner of affectations which
were not actually immoral. Lord Petersham headed them. At the
present day dandies of this stamp have almost entirely disappeared, but
the new school of muscular Christians is not altogether faultless. The
feminine of <span class="smcap lowercase">DANDY</span> was <span class="smcap lowercase">DANDIZETTE</span>, but the term only lived for a
short season.</p>

<p><b>Dandy</b>, a small glass of whisky.&mdash;<i>Irish.</i> “Dimidium cyathi vero apud
Metropolitanos Hibernicos dicitur <span class="smcap lowercase">DANDY</span>.”&mdash;<i>Father Tom and the Pope</i>,

he would undoubtedly have mentioned it. The mistake of Julian
is corrected in the next paragraph. It is said that handcuffs were, when

which would soon be shortened as a natural consequence.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Darble</b>, the devil. <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DIABLE</span>.</p>

a horse of whom nothing positive is known, but who is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
supposed to have claims to the consideration of all interested, whether
bookmakers or backers.</p>

<p><b>Darky</b>, twilight; also a negro. <span class="smcap">Darkmans</span>, the night.</p>

<p><b>Dash</b>, to jot down suddenly. “Things I have <span class="smcap lowercase">DASHED</span> off at a moment’s
notice.”</p>

<p><b>Dash</b>, fire, vigour, manliness. Literary and artistic work is often said to
be full of <span class="smcap lowercase">DASH</span>.</p>

<p><b>Dash</b>, an ejaculation, as “<span class="smcap lowercase">DASH</span> my wig!” “<span class="smcap lowercase">DASH</span> my buttons!” A relic
of the attempts made, when cursing was fashionable, to be in the mode
without using “bad words.”</p>

<p><b>Dashing</b>, showy, fast.</p>

<p><b>Daub</b>, in low language, an artist. Also a badly painted picture.</p>

<p><b>David’s sow</b>, “as drunk as <span class="smcap lowercase">DAVID’S</span> sow,” <i>i.e.</i>, beastly drunk. <i>See</i>
origin of the phrase in Grose’s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p><b>Davy</b>, “on my <span class="smcap lowercase">DAVY</span>,” on my affidavit, of which it is a vulgar corruption.
Latterly <span class="smcap lowercase">DAVY</span> has become synonymous in street language with the
name of the Deity; “so help me <span class="smcap lowercase">DAVY</span>,” generally rendered, “swelp
my <span class="smcap lowercase">DAVY</span>.” Slang version of the conclusion of the oath usually
exacted of witnesses.</p>

<p><b>Davy’s locker</b>, or <span class="smcap">Davy Jones’s locker</span>, the sea, the common receptacle
for all things thrown overboard;&mdash;a nautical phrase for death, is
“gone to <span class="smcap">Davy Jones’s locker</span>,” which there means the other world.&mdash;<i>See</i>

<p><b><a id="Daylights"></a>Daylights</b>, eyes; “to darken his <span class="smcap lowercase">DAYLIGHTS</span>,” to give a person black
eyes. Also the spaces left in glasses between the liquor and the brim,&mdash;not
allowed when bumpers are drunk. The toast-master in such
cases cries “no <span class="smcap lowercase">DAYLIGHTS</span> or heeltaps!”</p>

<p><b>Daze</b>, to confound or bewilder; an ancient form of dazzle used by Spenser,
Drayton, &amp;c. This is more obsolete English than slang, though its
use nowadays might fairly bring it within the latter category.</p>

<p><b>Dead-against</b>, decidedly opposed to.</p>

<p><b>Dead-alive</b>, stupid, dull.</p>

<p><b>Dead-amiss</b>, said of a horse that from illness is utterly unable to run for
a prize.</p>

<p><b><a id="Dead-beat"></a>Dead-beat</b>, utterly exhausted, utterly “done up.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Dead-heat"></a>Dead-heat</b>, when two horses run home so exactly equal that the judge
cannot place one before the other; consequently, a <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-HEAT</span> is a
heat which counts for nothing, so far as the even runners are concerned,
as it has to be run over again. When a race between dead-heaters
has been unusually severe, or when the stake is sufficiently good to bear
division, it is usual to let one of the animals walk over the course so as
to make a deciding heat, and to divide the money. In such case
all bets are divided. Sometimes, however, when no arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
can be made, an owner will withdraw his horse, in which case the
animal that walks over wins the whole of the stake, and his backers
the whole of their money. Where the course is short and the money
of small amount, the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-HEAT</span> is run off, the second essay being
called the decider, though on certain occasions even the decider has
resulted in a <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-HEAT</span>.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Neck_and_neck">NECK AND NECK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Dead-horse</b>, “to draw the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-HORSE</span>;” <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-HORSE</span> work&mdash;working
for wages already paid; also any thankless or unassisted
service.</p>

<p><b>Dead-letter</b>, an action of no value or weight; an article, owing to
some mistake in its production, rendered utterly valueless,&mdash;often applied
to any instrument in writing, which by some apparently trivial
omission, becomes useless. At the general and large district post-offices,
there is a department for letters which have been erroneously
addressed, or for which, from many and various causes, there are no
receivers. These are called <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-LETTERS</span>, and the office in connexion
with them is known as the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-LETTER</span> office.</p>

<p><b>Dead-lock</b>, a permanent standstill, an inextricable entanglement.</p>

<p><b>Dead-lurk</b>, entering a dwelling-house during divine service.</p>

<p><b>Dead-man</b>, a baker. Properly speaking, it is an extra loaf smuggled
into the basket by the man who carries it out, to the loss of the master.
Sometimes the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD-MAN</span> is charged to a customer, though never delivered.
Among London thieves and low people generally a “dead’un”
is a half-quartern loaf.</p>

<p><b>Deaner</b>, a shilling. From <span class="smcap lowercase">DENIER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Death-hunter</b>, a running patterer, who vends last dying speeches and
confessions. More modernly the term is supposed to mean an undertaker,
or any one engaged in or concerned with burials.</p>

<p><b>Deck</b>, a pack of cards. Used by Shakspeare, 3 <i>K. Hen. VI.</i>, v. 1.
Probably because of <span class="smcap lowercase">DECKING</span> or arranging the table for a game
at cards. General in the United States.</p>

<p><b>Dee</b>, a pocket-book; term used by tramps.&mdash;<i>Gipsy.</i> <span class="smcap">Dee</span> (properly D), a

<p><b>Demirep</b> (or <span class="smcap lowercase">DEMIRIP</span>), a courtezan. Contraction of <span class="smcap lowercase">DEMI-REPUTATION</span>,
which is, in turn, a contraction for <i>demi-monde</i> reputation.</p>

<p><b>Derby-dog</b>, a masterless animal, who is sure to appear as soon as the
Epsom course is cleared for the great race of the season. No year passes
without a dog running between the two dense lines of spectators and
searching in vain for an outlet, and he is almost as eagerly looked for
as are the “preliminary canters.” It is said that when no <span class="smcap lowercase">DERBY-DOG</span>
appears on the course between Tattenham Corner and the judge’s box,
just before the start, a dead-heat will take place between all the placed
horses.</p>

<div><p><b>Derrick</b>, an apparatus for raising sunken ships, &amp;c. The term is curiously
derived from a hangman of that name frequently mentioned in
Old Plays, as in the <i>Bellman of London</i>, 1616.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He rides circuit with the devil, and <span class="smcap lowercase">DERRICK</span> must be his host, and Tyborne the
inn at which he will light.”</p></div>

<p>The term is now almost general for all cranes used in loading ships, or
doing similar work of a heavy nature.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Despatchers</b>, false dice with two sets of numbers, and, of course,
no low pips. So called because they bring the matter to a speedy issue.
Great skill in palming is necessary for their successful use.</p>

or <span class="smcap">Zeus</span>.</p>

<p><b>Deuce</b>, twopence; <span class="smcap lowercase">DEUCE</span> at cards or dice, one with two pips or spots.</p>

<p><b>Devil</b>, among barristers, to get up the facts of a case for a leader; to
arrange everything in the most comprehensive form, so that the Q.C. or
Serjeant can absorb the question without much trouble. <span class="smcap">Devilling</span>
is juniors’ work, but much depends on it, and on the ability with which
it is done.</p>

<p><b>Devil</b>, a printer’s youngest apprentice, an errand-boy in a printing-office.</p>

<p><b>Devil dodger</b>, a clergyman; also a person who goes sometimes to
church and sometimes to meeting.</p>

<p><b>Devil’s dung</b>, the fetid drug assafœtida.</p>

<p><b>Devil’s dust</b>, a term used in the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire
to denote shreds of old cloth torn up to re-manufacture; also called
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHODDY</span>. Mr. Ferrand, in his speech in the House, March 4, 1842,
produced a piece of cloth made chiefly from <span class="smcap lowercase">DEVIL’S DUST</span>, and tore

fall, are said to have these.&mdash;<i>Stable.</i></p>

<p><b>Dew-beaters</b>, feet; “hold out your <span class="smcap lowercase">DEW-BEATERS</span> till I take off the

for heavy shoes to resist wet.</p>

<p><b>Dew-drink</b>, a morning draught, such as is served out to labourers in
harvest time before commencing work.</p>

<p><b>Dewskitch</b>, a good thrashing, perhaps from catching one’s due.</p>

<p><b>Dibbs</b>, money; so called from the huckle bones of sheep, which have
been used from the earliest times for gambling purposes when money
was not obtainable&mdash;in one particular game being thrown up five at a
time and caught on the back of the hand like halfpence.</p>

<p><b>Dick</b>, a riding whip; gold-headed <span class="smcap lowercase">DICK</span>, one so ornamented.</p>

<p><b><a id="Dick"></a>Dick</b>, abbreviation of “Dictionary,” but often euphemistically rendered
“Richard,”&mdash;fine language, long words. A man who uses fine words
without much judgment is said to have “swallowed the <span class="smcap lowercase">DICK</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Dickens</b>, synonymous with devil; “what the <span class="smcap lowercase">DICKENS</span> are you after?”
what the devil are you doing? Used by Shakspeare in the <i>Merry
Wives of Windsor</i>. In many old stories his Satanic Majesty is called
the <span class="smcap lowercase">DICKENS</span>, and by no other name, while in some others the word is
spelt “diconce.”</p>

<p><b>Dickey</b>, bad, sorry, or foolish; food or lodging is pronounced <span class="smcap lowercase">DICKEY</span>
when of a poor description; “very <span class="smcap lowercase">DICKEY</span>”, very inferior; “it’s all

<p><b><a id="Dickey"></a>Dickey</b>, formerly the cant for a worn-out shirt, but nowadays used for a
front or half-shirt. <span class="smcap">Dickey</span> was originally “tommy” (from the Greek,
τομή, a section), a name which was formerly used in Trinity College,
Dublin. The students are said to have invented the term, and love
of change and circumlocution soon changed it to <span class="smcap lowercase">DICKEY</span>, in which
dress it is supposed to have been imported into England.</p>

<p><b>Dickey</b>, a donkey.&mdash;<i>Norfolk.</i></p>

<p><b>Dickey Sam</b>, a native of Liverpool.</p>

<p><b>Dicking;</b> “look! the bulky is <span class="smcap lowercase">DICKING</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, the constable has his eye
on you.&mdash;<i>North Country Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Diddle</b>, old cant word for geneva, or gin.</p>

<p><b>Diddle</b>, to cheat, or defraud.&mdash;<i>Old.</i> In <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DUDELN</span> is to play on
the bagpipe; and the ideas of piping and cheating seem to have been
much connected. “Do you think I am easier played on than a pipe?”
occurs in <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

<p><b>Diddler</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">JEREMY DIDDLER</span>, an artful swindler. A diddler is generally
one who borrows money without any intention of ever repaying
it; the sort of man who, having asked for half-a-crown and received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
only a shilling, would consider that eighteenpence was owing to him.&mdash;From
<i>Raising the Wind</i>.</p>

<p><b>Diddling</b>, cheating or swindling. Borrowing money without any intention
of repaying it. Edgar Allan Poe wrote a very amusing article once on
<span class="smcap lowercase">DIDDLING</span>, which he seemed to regard as a rather high art.</p>

<p><b>Didoes</b>, pranks or capers; “to cut up <span class="smcap lowercase">DIDOES</span>,” to make pranks.</p>

<p><b>Dig</b>, a hard blow. Generally in pugilistic circles applied to a straight
“left-hander,” delivered under the guard on the “mark.”</p>

<p><b>Diggers</b>, spurs; also the spades on cards.</p>

<p><b>Diggings</b>, lodgings, apartments, residence; an expression probably imported
from California, or Australia, with reference to the gold
diggings. It is very common nowadays for a man moving in very
decent society to call his abode or his office, or anyplace to which he
frequently resorts, his “<span class="smcap lowercase">DIGGINGS</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Dilly</b>, originally a coach, from <i>diligence</i>. Now a night-cart.</p>

<p><b>Dimber</b>, neat or pretty.&mdash;<i>Worcestershire</i>, but old cant.</p>

<p><b>Dimmock</b>, money; “how are you off for <span class="smcap lowercase">DIMMOCK</span>?” diminutive of
<span class="smcap lowercase">DIME</span>, a small foreign silver coin, in the United States 10 cents.</p>

<p><b><a id="Dinarly"></a>Dinarly</b>, money; “<span class="smcap lowercase">NANTEE DINARLY</span>,” I have no money, corrupted
from the <i>Lingua Franca</i>, “<span class="smcap lowercase">NIENTE DINARO</span>,” not a penny. <i>Turkish</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DINARI</span>; <i>Spanish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DINERO</span>; <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DENARIUS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Dine out</b>, to go without dinner. “I <span class="smcap lowercase">DINED OUT</span> to-day,” would
express the same among the very lower classes that “dining with Duke
Humphrey” expresses among the middle and upper.</p>

<div><p><b>Ding</b>, to strike; to throw away, or get rid of anything; to pass to a confederate
by throwing. <i>Old</i>, used in old plays.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The butcher’s axe (like great Alcides’ bat)<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Dings</i> deadly downe ten thousand thousand flat.”<br /></span>
</div>
<span class="sig"><i>Taylor’s Works</i>, 1630.<br /></span>

<i>g</i> in this is pronounced hard.</p>

<p><b>Dipped</b>, mortgaged.</p>

<p><b>Dirt</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TO EAT</span>, an expression derived from the East, nearly the same as
“to eat humble (<i>Umble</i>) pie,” to put up with a mortification or insult.</p>

<p><b>Dirty Half-hundred</b>, a nickname given to the 50th Regiment on
account of their tattered and soiled appearance during the Peninsular
War. A term to be proud of, as it implies much work and little
reward.</p>

<div><p><b>Disguised</b>, intoxicated. A very old term is that of “<span class="smcap lowercase">DISGUISED</span> in
drink.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Some say drinking does <span class="smcap lowercase">DISGUISE</span> men.”&mdash;<i>Old Song.</i><br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span><b>Dish</b>, to stop, to do away with, to suppress; <span class="smcap lowercase">DISHED</span>, done for, floored,
beaten, or silenced. To “do brown” and to “<span class="smcap lowercase">DISH</span>,” both verbs
with very similar meanings, have an evident connexion so far as origin
is concerned, and most likely were both first used in the kitchen as
synonymous with “done for.” The late Lord Derby made the
word “<span class="smcap lowercase">DISH</span>” famous by his latest public act, that of “<span class="smcap lowercase">DISHING</span> the
Whigs.”</p>

<p><b>Dithers</b>, nervous or cold shiverings; “it gave me the <span class="smcap lowercase">DITHERS</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Dittoes</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A SUIT OF</span>, coat, waistcoat, and trousers of the same material.&mdash;<i>Tailor’s
term.</i></p>

<p><b>Ditty-bag</b>, the bag or huswife in which sailors keep needles, thread,
buttons, &amp;c., for mending their clothes.</p>

<p><b>Diver</b>, a pickpocket. Also applied to fingers, no doubt from a similar
reason. To <span class="smcap lowercase">DIVE</span> is to pick pockets.</p>

<p><b><a id="Do"></a>Do</b>, this useful and industrious verb has for many years done service as a
slang term. To <span class="smcap lowercase">DO</span> a person is to cheat him. Sometimes another
tense is employed, such as “I <span class="smcap lowercase">DONE</span> him,” meaning, I cheated or “paid
him out;” this is only used in the lowest grades of society. <span class="smcap">Done
brown</span>, cheated thoroughly, befooled; <span class="smcap lowercase">DONE OVER</span>, upset, cheated,
knocked down, ruined. Among thieves <span class="smcap lowercase">DONE OVER</span> means that a
man’s pockets have been all quietly searched; the term also means
among low people seduced; <span class="smcap lowercase">DONE UP</span>, used up, finished, or quieted.
<span class="smcap">Done</span> also means convicted, or sentenced; so does <span class="smcap lowercase">DONE-FOR</span>. To
<span class="smcap lowercase">DO</span> a person in pugilism is to beat him. Humphreys, who fought
Mendoza, a Jew, wrote this laconic note to his supporter&mdash;“I have
<span class="smcap lowercase">DONE</span> the Jew, and am in good health.&mdash;Rich. Humphreys.” Tourists
use the expression, “I have <span class="smcap lowercase">DONE</span> France and Italy,” meaning I have
been through those countries.</p>

<p><b>Dobie</b>, an Indian washerman; and though women wash clothes in this
country, Anglo-Indians speak of a washerwoman as a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOBIE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Doctor</b>, to adulterate or drug liquor; to poison, to hocus; also to falsify
accounts. A publican who sells bad liquors is said to keep the <span class="smcap lowercase">DOCTOR</span>
in his cellars. On board ship the cook is always termed “the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOCTOR</span>.”&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Cook">COOK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Doddy</b>, a term applied in Norfolk to any person of low stature. Sometimes
<span class="smcap lowercase">HODMANDOD</span> and “<span class="smcap lowercase">HODDY-DODDY</span>, all head and no body.”
<span class="smcap">Dodman</span> in the same dialect denotes a garden snail.</p>

<p><b>Dodge</b>, a cunning trick. “<span class="smcap">Dodge</span>, that homely but expressive phrase.”&mdash;Sir
Hugh Cairns on the Reform Bill, 2nd March, 1859. <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEOGIAN</span>, to colour, to conceal. The <span class="smcap lowercase">TIDY DODGE</span>, as it is
called by street-folk, consists in dressing up a family clean and tidy,
and parading in the streets to excite compassion and obtain alms.</p>

<p><b>Dodger</b>, a dram. In Kent, a <span class="smcap lowercase">DODGER</span> signifies a nightcap; which name
is often given to the last dram at night.</p>

<p><b>Dodger</b>, a tricky person, or one who, to use the popular phrase, “knows
too much.” Also one who knows all phases of London life, and
profits by such knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Dogberry</b>, a foolish constable.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Dog cheap</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG-FOOLISH</span>, very or singularly cheap, or foolish.
Latham, in his <i>English Language</i>, says:&mdash;“This has nothing to do
with dogs. The first syllable is god=<i>good</i>, transposed, and the second,
the ch‑‑p, is chapman, merchant: compare <span class="smcap lowercase">EASTCHEAP</span>.”&mdash;<i>Old term.</i></p>

<p><b>Doggery</b>, nonsense, transparent attempts to cheat.</p>

<p><b>Dog gone</b>, a form of mild swearing used by boys.</p>

<p><b>Dog in a blanket</b>, a kind of pudding, made of preserved fruit spread
on thin dough, and then rolled up and boiled. This pudding is also
called “rolly-polly” and “stocking.”</p>

<p><b>Dog in the manger</b>, a scurvy, ill-conditioned, selfish fellow. From
the fable of that title.</p>

<p><b>Dog Latin</b>, barbarous Latin, such as was formerly used by lawyers in
their pleadings. Now applied to medical Latin.</p>

<p><b>Dogs</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TO GO TO THE</span>, to be commercially or socially ruined. Originally
a stable term applied to old or worthless horses, sold to feed hounds.</p>

<p><b>Dog’s body</b>, a kind of pease pudding.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Dog’s ears</b>, the curled corners of the leaves of books, which have been
carelessly treated. The use of this term is so common that it is hardly
to be considered slang.</p>

<p><b>Dog’s nose</b>, gin and beer, so called from the mixture being <i>cold</i>, like a
dog’s nose.</p>

<p><b>Dog stealer</b>, a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG DEALER</span>. There is sometimes less difference between
the two trades than between “d” and “st.”</p>

<p><b>Doing time</b>, working out a sentence in prison. “He’s done time,” is
a slang phrase used in reference to a man who is known to have been
in gaol.</p>

<p><b>Doldrums</b>, difficulties, low spirits, dumps.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Dollop</b>, a lump or portion.&mdash;<i>Norfolk.</i> <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DALE</span>, <i>dole</i>.</p>

<p><b>Dollop</b>, to <i>dole up</i>, to give up a share.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p><b>Dolly</b>, a very mild gambling contrivance, generally used in sweetmeat
and other child’s-ware shops, until stopped by the authorities a few
years back, and consisting of a round board and the figure of an old
man or “<span class="smcap lowercase">DOLLY</span>,” down which was a spiral hole. A marble dropped
“down the <span class="smcap lowercase">DOLLY</span>,” would stop in one of the small holes or pits
(numbered) on the board. The bet was decided according as the
marble stopped on a high or low figure. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Dolly_shop">DOLLY-SHOP</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Dollymop</b>, a tawdrily-dressed maid-servant, a semi-professional street-walker.</p>

<p><b><a id="Dolly_shop"></a>Dolly shop</b>, an illegal pawnshop,&mdash;where goods, or stolen property, not
good enough for the pawnbroker, are received, and charged at so much
per day. If not redeemed the third day the goods are forfeited.
Originally these shops were rag shops as well, and were represented
by the <i>black doll</i>, the usual sign of a rag shop. Twenty years ago, a
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOLLY SHOP</span> was, among boys, a small sweetstuff and fruit shop where
a hollow wooden figure, of the kind described above, was kept. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
wager was made, and the customer got double quantity for his money,
or nothing. A paternal legislature, and a police system worthy of the
task, have long since wiped this blot from a nation’s face. The
amount at stake was generally a halfpenny, sometimes less.</p>

<p><b>Dominie</b>, a parson, or master at a grammar school.</p>

<p><b>Domino</b>, a common ejaculation of soldiers and sailors when they receive
the last lash of a flogging. The allusion may be understood from the
game of dominoes. A <span class="smcap lowercase">DOMINO</span> means either a blow, or the last of a
series of things, whether pleasant or otherwise, so the ejaculation
savours somewhat of wit.</p>

<p><b>Dominoes</b>, the teeth.</p>

<p><b>Don</b>, a clever fellow, the opposite of a muff; a person of distinction in
his line or walk. At the English Universities, the Masters and Fellows
are the <span class="smcap lowercase">DONS</span>. <span class="smcap">Don</span> is also used as an adjective, “a <span class="smcap lowercase">DON</span> hand at a
knife and fork,” <i>i.e.</i>, a first-rate feeder at a dinner-table.</p>

<p><b>Dona and feeles</b>, a woman and children. <i>Italian</i> or <i>Lingua Franca</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DONNE E FIGLIE</span>. The word <span class="smcap lowercase">DONA</span> is usually pronounced <span class="smcap lowercase">DONER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Done!</b> the expression used when a bet is accepted. To be <span class="smcap lowercase">DONE</span>, is to be
considerably worsted.&mdash;<i>See</i> also <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Do">DO</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Done up</b>, an equivalent expression to “dead beat.”</p>

<p><b>Donkey</b>, “tuppence more and up goes the <span class="smcap lowercase">DONKEY</span>,” a vulgar street
phrase for extracting as much money as possible before performing any
task. The phrase had its origin with a travelling showman, the finale
of whose performance was the hoisting of a <span class="smcap lowercase">DONKEY</span> on a pole or
ladder; but this consummation was never arrived at unless the required
amount was first paid up, and “tuppence more” was generally the
sum demanded.</p>

<p><b><a id="Donkey"></a>Donkey</b>, in printers’ slang, means a compositor. In the days before
steam machinery was invented, the men who worked at press&mdash;the pressmen&mdash;were
so dirty and drunken a body that they earned the name of
pigs. In revenge, and for no reason that can be discovered, they
christened the compositors <span class="smcap lowercase">DONKEYS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Don Pedro</b>, a game at cards. It is a compound of All Fours, and the
Irish game variously termed All Fives, Five and Ten, Fifteen, Forty-five,
&amp;c. It was probably invented by the mixed English and Irish
rabble who fought in Portugal in 1832-3.</p>

<p><b>Dookin</b>, fortune-telling. <i>Gipsy</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DUKKERIN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Dose</b>, three months’ imprisonment with hard labour.</p>

<p><b>Doss</b>, a bed. Probably from <span class="smcap lowercase">DOZE</span>, though quite as likely from <span class="smcap lowercase">DORSE</span>, the
back. Least likely of all, as any one who knows aught about the surrounding
circumstances of those who use the term will admit, is it from
the Norman, <span class="smcap lowercase">DOSSEL</span>, a hanging or bed canopy, from which some have
professed to derive it.</p>

<p><b>Doss</b>, to sleep, formerly spelt <span class="smcap lowercase">DORSE</span>. <i>Gael.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DOSAL</span>, slumber. In the
old pugilistic days a man knocked down, or out of time, was said to be
“sent to <span class="smcap lowercase">DORSE</span>,” but whether because he was senseless, or because he
lay on his back, is not known, though most likely the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Dossing-ken</b>, a lodging-house.</p>

<p><b>Dot and go one</b>, a lame or limping man.</p>

<p><b>Do the high</b>, to walk up and down High Street on Sunday evenings,
especially just after Church.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Double</b>, “to tip (or give) the <span class="smcap lowercase">DOUBLE</span>,” to run away from any person;
to double back, turn short round upon one’s pursuers, and so escape,
as a hare does.&mdash;<i>Sporting.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Double_cross"></a>Double cross</b>, a <span class="smcap lowercase">CROSS</span> in which a man who has engaged to lose breaks
his engagement, and “goes straight” at the last moment. This proceeding
is called “doubling” or “putting the double on,” and is often
productive of much excitement in athletic circles.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Cross">CROSS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Double lines</b>, ship casualties. So called at Lloyd’s from the manner of
entering in books kept for the purpose.</p>

<p><b>Double-shuffle</b>, a low, shuffling, noisy dance, common amongst costermongers.
Sometimes called “cellar flap,” from its being danced
by the impecunious on the cellar-flaps of public-houses, outside which
they must perforce remain.</p>

<p><b>Doublet</b>, a spurious diamond, made up of two smaller stones for pawning
or duffing purposes. These articles are cleverly manufactured and
excellently set, and a practised eye can alone detect the imposition.&mdash;<i>See</i>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Moskeneer">Moskeneer</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Double up</b>, to pair off, or “chum” with another man; to beat severely,
so as to leave the sufferer “all of a heap.”</p>

<p><b>Doughy</b>, a sufficiently obvious nickname for a baker.</p>

<p><b>Douse</b>, to put out; “<span class="smcap lowercase">DOUSE</span> that glim,” put out that candle. In Norfolk
this expression is <span class="smcap lowercase">DOUT</span>, which is clearly for <span class="smcap lowercase">DO OUT</span>. Sometimes
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOUSE</span> means to rinse; and sometimes to throw water, clean or dirty,
over any one, is to “<span class="smcap lowercase">DOUSE</span> it.”</p>

<div><p><b>Dovercourt</b>, a noisy assemblage; “all talkers and no hearers, like
<span class="smcap">Dovercourt</span>.” At Dovercourt, in Essex, a court is annually held;
and as the members principally consist of rude fishermen, the irregularity
noticed in the proverbial saying frequently prevails. Bramston
in his <i>Art of Politics</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Those who would captivate the well-bred throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should not too often speak, nor speak too long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Church, nor church matters, ever turn to sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor make St. Stephen’s Chapel <span class="smcap">Dover Court</span>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This would seem to be more properly applied to a Court of Dover
people, a <span class="smcap">Dover Court</span>, not a <span class="smcap">Dovercourt Court</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Dove-tart</b>, a pigeon pie. A snake tart is an eel pie.</p>

<p><b>Dowd</b>, a woman’s nightcap.&mdash;<i>Devonshire</i>: also an American term; possibly
from <span class="smcap lowercase">DOWDY</span>, a slatternly woman.</p>

<p><b>Dowlas</b>, a linendraper. <span class="smcap">Dowlas</span> is a sort of towelling.</p>

<p><b>Down</b>, to be aware of, or awake to, any move&mdash;in this meaning, exchangeable
with <span class="smcap lowercase">UP</span>; “<span class="smcap lowercase">DOWN</span> upon one’s luck,” unfortunate; “<span class="smcap lowercase">DOWN</span>
in the mouth,” disconsolate; “to be <span class="smcap lowercase">DOWN</span> on one,” to treat him
harshly or suspiciously, to pounce upon him, or detect his tricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Downer</b>, a sixpence; apparently the Gipsy word, <span class="smcap lowercase">TAWNO</span>, “little one,”

<p><b>Down the road</b>, stylish, showy, after the fashion.</p>

<p><b>Down to the ground</b>, an American rendering of the word entirely;
as, “that suits me <span class="smcap lowercase">DOWN TO THE GROUND</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Downy</b>, knowing or cunning; “a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOWNY COVE</span>,” a knowing or experienced
sharper. Literally, a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOWNY</span> person is one who is “<span class="smcap lowercase">DOWN</span> to
every move on the board.” In Norfolk, however, it means low-spirited,
<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DOWN</span> in the mouth.</p>

<p><b>Dowry</b>, a lot, a great deal; “<span class="smcap lowercase">DOWRY</span> of parny,” lot of rain or water.&mdash;<i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Parney">PARNY</a></span>. Probably from the Gipsy.</p>

<p><b>Dowsers</b>, men who profess to tell fortunes, and who, by the use of the
divining rod, pretend to be able to discover treasure-trove.&mdash;<i>Cornish.</i></p>

<p><b>Doxy</b>, the female companion of a tramp or beggar. In the West of England,
the women frequently call their little girls <span class="smcap lowercase">DOXIES</span>, in a familiar
or endearing sense. <i>Orthodoxy</i> has been described as being a man’s
own <span class="smcap lowercase">DOXY</span>, and <i>heterodoxy</i> another man’s <span class="smcap lowercase">DOXY</span>.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Drab</b>, a vulgar or low woman.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Drab</b>, poison.&mdash;<i>Romany.</i></p>

<p><b>Draft on Aldgate Pump</b>, an old mercantile phrase for a fictitious
banknote or fraudulent bill.</p>

<p><b>Drag</b>, a cart of any kind, term generally used to denote any particularly
well-appointed turnout, drawn by a pair or four horses, especially at
race meetings.</p>

<p><b>Drag</b>, feminine attire worn by men. A recent notorious impersonation
case led to the publication of the word in that sense.</p>

<p><b>Drag</b>, a street, or road; <span class="smcap lowercase">BACK-DRAG</span>, back street.</p>

<p><b>Drag</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">THREE MOON</span>, three months in prison.</p>

<p><b>Drag</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">THE</span>, a favourite pursuit with fast-hunting sets; as, <span class="smcap lowercase">THE DRAG</span> can
be trailed over very stiff country.</p>

<p><b>Dragging</b>, robbing carts, &amp;c., by means of a light trap which follows

way, though it is hard to say whether with or without the complicity
of the cabmen.</p>

fellows begin pulling the wenches about.</p>

<p><b>Draggletail</b>, a dirty, dissipated woman; a prostitute of the lowest class.</p>

<p><b>Drain</b>, a drink; “to do a <span class="smcap lowercase">DRAIN</span>,” to take a friendly drink&mdash;“do a wet;”
sometimes called a “common sewer.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Draw"></a>Draw</b>, used in several senses:&mdash;1, of a theatre, new piece or exhibition,
when it attracts the public and succeeds; 2, to induce&mdash;as, “<span class="smcap lowercase">DRAW</span> him
on;” 3, of pocket-picking&mdash;as, “<span class="smcap lowercase">DRAW</span> his wipe,” “<span class="smcap lowercase">DRAW</span> his ticker.”
In sporting parlance it is used with an ellipsis of “trigger,” “I <span class="smcap lowercase">DREW</span>
on it as it rose.” In America to “<span class="smcap lowercase">DRAW</span> on a man” is to produce
knife or pistol, and to use it as well. Where lethal weapons are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
used in the States, no man raises his weapon till he means to use it,
and a celebrated American writer has recently given a dissertation on
the relative advantages of cocking and firing a pistol by an almost
simultaneous action as it is raised, and of cocking as the instrument is
raised, and of then dropping the muzzle slightly as the trigger is pulled.
The former way is more speedy, the latter more effective. “Come,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DRAW</span> it mild!” <i>i.e.</i>, don’t exaggerate; opposite of “come it strong,”
from the phraseology of the bar (of a “public”), where customers
desire the beer to be “drawn mild.”</p>

<p><b>Draw-boy</b>, a cunning device used by puffing tradesmen. A really good
article is advertised or ticketed and exposed for sale in the shop window
at a very low price, with a view of drawing in customers to purchase
other and inferior articles at high prices. These gentry have
fortunately found to their cost, on one or two occasions, by means of
magisterial decisions, that <span class="smcap lowercase">DRAW-BOYS</span> have drawn for their owners
something other than profit.</p>

<p><b>Drawers</b>, formerly the ancient cant name for very long stockings.</p>

<p><b>Drawing teeth</b>, wrenching off knockers.&mdash;<i>Medical Student slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Drawlatch</b>, a loiterer.</p>

<p><b>Draw off</b>, to throw back the body to give impetus to a blow; “he
<span class="smcap lowercase">DREW OFF</span>, and delivered on the left drum.”&mdash;<i>Pugilistic.</i> A sailor would
say, “he hauled off and slipped in.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Draw_the_long_bow"></a>Draw the long bow</b>, to tell extravagant stories, to exaggerate overmuch;
same as “throw the hatchet.” From the extremely wonderful
stories which used to be told of the Norman archers, and more
subsequently of Indians’ skill with the tomahawk.</p>

<p><b>Dress a hat</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TO</span>, to rob in a manner very difficult of detection. The
business is managed by two or more servants or shopmen of different employers,
exchanging their master’s goods; as, for instance, a shoemaker’s
shopman receives shirts or other articles from a hosier’s, in return for a
pair of boots. Another very ingenious method may be witnessed about
eleven o’clock in the forenoon in any of the suburban districts of
London. A butcher’s boy, with a bit of steak filched from his master’s
shop, or from a customer, falls in with a neighbouring baker’s man,
who has a loaf obtained in a similar manner. Their mutual friend,
the potboy, in full expectation of their visit, has the tap-room fire
bright and clear, and not only cooks the steak, but again, by means of
collusion, this time with the barman or barmaid, “stands a shant
of gatter” as his share. So a capital luncheon is improvised for
the three, without the necessity of paying for it; and this practical
communistic operation is styled <span class="smcap lowercase">DRESSING A HAT</span>. Most likely from
the fact that a hat receives the attention of three or four people before
it is properly fit for wear.</p>

<p><b>Dripping</b>, a cook.</p>

<p><b>Drive</b>, a term used by tradesmen in speaking of business; “he’s <span class="smcap lowercase">DRIVING</span>
a roaring trade,” <i>i.e.</i>, a very good one; hence, to succeed in a bargain,
“I <span class="smcap lowercase">DROVE</span> a good bargain,” <i>i.e.</i>, got the best end of it. To “<span class="smcap lowercase">LET
DRIVE</span> at one,” to strike out. A man snoring hard is said to be
“<span class="smcap lowercase">DRIVING</span> his pigs to market.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Drive at</b>, to aim at; “what is he <span class="smcap lowercase">DRIVING AT</span>?” “what does he
intend to imply?” a phrase often used when a circuitous line of argument
is adopted by a barrister, or a strange set of questions asked, the
purport of which is not very evident.</p>

<p><b>Driz</b>, lace. In a low lodging-house this singular autograph inscription
appeared over the mantelpiece. “Scotch Mary, with <span class="smcap lowercase">DRIZ</span> [lace],
bound to Dover and back, please God.” It is a common thing for ignorant
or superstitious people to make some mark or sign before going on
a journey, and then to wonder whether it will be there when they return.</p>

<p><b>Driz-fencer</b>, a person who sells lace.</p>

<p><b>Drop</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">DROP</span> an acquaintance,” to relinquish a connexion, is very
polite slang. <span class="smcap">Dropping</span> is distinguished from cutting by being done
gradually and almost imperceptibly, whereas cutting has outward and
visible signs which may be unpleasantly resented. To “<span class="smcap lowercase">DROP</span> money”
at any form of speculation or gambling, is to lose it.</p>

<p><b>Drop</b>, to quit, go off, or turn aside; “<span class="smcap lowercase">DROP</span> the main Toby,” go off the
main road.</p>

<p><b>Drop</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">DROP</span> a man,” to knock him down; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">DROP</span> into a person,”
to give him a thrashing. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Slip">SLIP</a></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Walk_into">WALK</a></span>. “To <span class="smcap lowercase">DROP</span> on a man,”
to accuse or rebuke him suddenly.</p>

<p><b>Drop it</b>, synonymous with “cut it” or “cheese it.” Probably from
the signal given in the good old hanging days by the culprit, who
used generally to drop a handkerchief when he was ready for the cart
to be moved from under him.</p>

<p><b>Drum</b>, a house, a lodging, a street; <span class="smcap lowercase">HAZARD-DRUM</span>, a gambling-house;
<span class="smcap lowercase">FLASH-DRUM</span>, a house of ill-fame.</p>

<p><b>Drum</b>, the ear.&mdash;<i>Pugilistic.</i> An example of slang synecdoche.</p>

<p><b>Drum</b>, as applied to the road, is doubtless from the Wallachian gipsy
word “<span class="smcap lowercase">DRUMRI</span>,” derived from the <i>Greek</i>, δρόμος.</p>

<p><b>Drum</b>, old slang for a ball or rout; afterwards called a hop.</p>

<p><b>Drummer</b>, a robber who first makes his victims insensible by drugs or
violence, and then plunders them.</p>

<p><b>Drumsticks</b>, legs; <span class="smcap lowercase">DRUMSTICK CASES</span>, trousers. The leg of a fowl is
generally called a <span class="smcap lowercase">DRUMSTICK</span>.</p>

<p><b>Dryasdust</b>, an antiquary. From Scott.</p>

<p><b>Dry lodging</b>, sleeping and sitting accommodation only, without board.
This is lodging-house keepers’ slang, and is generally used in reference
to rooms let to lodgers who take their meals at their clubs, or in the City,
according to their social positions.</p>

<p><b>Dry nurse</b>, when an inferior officer on board ship carries on the duty,
on account of the captain’s ignorance of seamanship, the junior officer
is said to <span class="smcap lowercase">DRY-NURSE</span> his captain. Majors and adjutants in the army
also not unfrequently <span class="smcap lowercase">DRY-NURSE</span> the colonels of their regiments in a
similar manner. The sergeant who coaches very young officers, is
called a “wet nurse.” The abolition of purchase has, however,
considerably modified all this.</p>

<p><b>D.T.</b>, a popular abbreviation of delirium tremens; sometimes written and
pronounced <i>del. trem.</i> D.T. also often represents the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Dub</b>, to pay or give; “<span class="smcap lowercase">DUB UP</span>,” pay up.</p>

<p><b>Dubash</b>, a general agent.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Dubber</b>, the mouth or tongue; “mum your <span class="smcap lowercase">DUBBER</span>,” hold your tongue.</p>

<p><b>Dubsman</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Screw">SCREW</a></span>, a turnkey.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Ducats</b>, money.&mdash;<i>Theatrical Slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Duck</b>, a bundle of bits of the “stickings” of beef sold for food to the
London poor.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Faggot2">FAGGOT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Ducket</b>, a ticket of any kind. Generally applied to pawnbroker’s duplicates
and raffle cards. Probably from <span class="smcap lowercase">DOCKET</span>.</p>

<p><b>Ducks</b>, trousers. <i>Sea</i> term. The expression most in use on land is
“white <span class="smcap lowercase">DUCKS</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, white pantaloons or trousers.</p>

<p><b>Ducks and Drakes</b>, “to make <span class="smcap lowercase">DUCKS AND DRAKES</span> of one’s money,”
to throw it away childishly&mdash;derived from children “shying” flat
stones on the surface of a pool, which they call <span class="smcap lowercase">DUCKS AND DRAKES</span>,
according to the number of skips they make.</p>

<p><b>Dudder</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">DUDSMAN</span>, a person who formerly travelled the country as a
pedlar, selling gown-pieces, silk waistcoats, &amp;c., to countrymen. In
selling a waistcoat-piece, which cost him perhaps five shillings,
for thirty shillings or two pounds, he would show great fear of the
revenue officer, and beg the purchasing clodhopper to kneel down in
a puddle of water, crook his arm, and swear that it might never become
straight if he told an exciseman, or even his own wife. The term
and practice are nearly obsolete. In Liverpool, however, and at the
East-end of London, men dressed up as sailors, with pretended silk
handkerchiefs and cigars “only just smuggled from the Indies,” are
still to be plentifully found.</p>

<p><b>Dudeen</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">DUDHEEN</span>, a short tobacco-pipe. Common term in Ireland
and the Irish quarters of London.</p>

<p><b>Duds</b>, clothes, or personal property. <i>Gaelic</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DUD</span>; <i>Ancient Cant</i>; also

stolen or smuggled.</p>

<p><b>Duff</b>, pudding; vulgar pronunciation of dough.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Duffer</b>, a hawker of “Brummagem” or sham jewellery, or of shams of any
kind, a fool, a worthless person. <span class="smcap">Duffer</span> was formerly synonymous
with <span class="smcap lowercase">DUDDER</span>, and was a general term given to pedlars. It is mentioned
in the <i>Frauds of London</i> (1760) as a word in frequent use in the
last century to express cheats of all kinds.</p>

<p><b>Duffer</b>, anything of no merit. A term applied by artists to a picture
below mediocrity, and by dealers in jewellery to any spurious article.
It is now general in its application to a worthless fellow.</p>

<p><b>Duffing</b>, false, counterfeit, worthless.</p>

<p><b><a id="Duffy"></a>Duffy</b>, a term for a ghost or spirit among the West Indian negroes. In
all probability the <span class="smcap lowercase">DAVY JONES</span> of sailors, and a contraction thereof
originally.</p>

<p><b>Duke</b>, gin, a term amongst livery servants.</p>

<p><b><a id="Duke_Humphrey"></a>Duke Humphrey.</b> “To dine with <span class="smcap">Duke Humphrey</span>” is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
euphuism for dining not at all. Many reasons have been given for the
saying, and the one most worthy of credence is this:&mdash;Some visitors
were inspecting the abbey where the remains of Humphrey Duke of
Gloucester lie, and one of them was unfortunately shut in, and remained
there <i>solus</i> while his companions were feasting at a neighbouring
hostelry. He was afterwards said to have dined with <span class="smcap">Duke Humphrey</span>,
and the saying eventually passed into a proverb.</p>

<p><b>Dukes</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">DOOKS</span>, the hands, originally modification of the rhyming
slang, “Duke of Yorks,” forks = fingers, hands&mdash;a long way round,
but quite true. The word is in very common use among low folk.
“Put up your <span class="smcap lowercase">DOOKS</span>” is a kind invitation to fight.</p>

<p><b>Dukey</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">DOOKEY</span>, a <a href="#Penny_gaff">penny gaff</a>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Dumbfound</b>, to perplex, to beat soundly till not able to speak. Originally
a cant word. Johnson cites the <i>Spectator</i> for the earliest use.
<i>Scotch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DUMBFOUNDER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Dummacker</b>, a knowing or acute person.</p>

<p><b>Dummies</b>, empty bottles, and drawers in an apothecary’s shop, labelled
so as to give the idea of an extensive stock. Chandlers’ shop keepers
and small general dealers use dummies largely, half-tubs of butter,
bladders of lard, hams, cheeses, &amp;c., being specially manufactured for
them. Dummies in libraries generally take the form of “Hume and
Smollett’s History of England” and other works not likely to tempt
the general reader.</p>

<p><b>Dummy</b>, a deaf-and-dumb person; a clumsy, awkward fellow; any one
unusually thick-witted.</p>

<p><b>Dummy</b>, in three-handed whist the person who holds two hands plays
<span class="smcap lowercase">DUMMY</span>.</p>

<p><b>Dummy</b>, a pocket-book. In this word the derivation is obvious, being
connected with <span class="smcap lowercase">DUMB</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, that which makes no sound. As a thieves’
term for a pocket-book, it is peculiarly applicable, for the contents of
pocket-books, bank-notes and papers, make no noise, while the money
in a purse may betray its presence by chinking.</p>

<p><b>Dump fencer</b>, a man who sells buttons.</p>

<p><b>Dumpish</b>, sullen or gloomy.</p>

<p><b>Dumpy</b>, short and stout.</p>

<p><b>Dun</b>, to solicit payment.&mdash;<i>Old Cant</i>, from the French <span class="smcap lowercase">DONNEZ</span>, give; or
from <span class="smcap">Joe Din</span>, or <span class="smcap">Dun</span>, a famous bailiff; or simply a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">DIN</span>,
from the <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">DUNAN</span>, to clamour.</p>

<p><b>Dunderhead</b>, a blockhead.</p>

<p><b>Dundreary</b>, an empty swell.</p>

<p><b>Dung</b>, an operative who works for an employer who does not give full or
“society” wages.</p>

<div><p><b>Dungaree</b>, low, common, coarse, vulgar.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i> <span class="smcap">Dungaree</span>
is the name of a disreputable suburb of Bombay, and also of a coarse
blue cloth worn by sailors.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><b>Dunkhorned</b>, sneaking, shabby. <span class="smcap">Dunkhorn</span> in Norfolk is the short,
blunt horn of a beast, and the adjective is applied to a cuckold who
has not spirit to resist his disgrace.</p>

<p><b>Dunnage</b>, baggage, clothes. Also, a sea term for wood or loose faggots
laid at the bottom of ships, upon which is placed the cargo.</p>

<p><b><a id="Dunnyken"></a>Dunnyken</b>, originally <span class="smcap">Dannaken,</span> a watercloset.&mdash;From <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Danna">DANNA</a></span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Ken">KEN</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Durrynacking</b>, offering lace or any other article as an introduction to
fortune-telling; generally practised by women.</p>

<p><b>Dust</b>, money; “down with the <span class="smcap lowercase">DUST</span>,” put down the money.&mdash;<i>Ancient.</i>
Dean Swift once took for his text, “He who giveth to the poor
lendeth to the Lord.” His sermon was short. “Now, my brethren,”
said he, “if you are satisfied with the security, down with the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DUST</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Dust</b>, a disturbance, or noise, “to raise a <span class="smcap lowercase">DUST</span>,” to make a row.</p>

<p><b>Dust</b>, to beat; “<span class="smcap lowercase">DUST</span> one’s jacket,” <i>i.e.</i>, give him a beating.</p>

<p><b>Dust-hole</b>, Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge.&mdash;<i>Univ. Slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Dust-hole</b>, the Queen’s Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, was so called
until comparatively recently, when it was entirely renovated and renamed,
and now, as the Prince of Wales’s, it is one of the most
fortunate and fashionable theatres in London.</p>

<p><b>Dustoorie</b>, commission, douceur, bribe.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Dusty</b>, a phrase used in answering a question where one expects approbation.
“What do you think of this?” “Well, it’s not so <span class="smcap lowercase">DUSTY</span>,”
<i>i.e.</i>, not so bad; sometimes varied to “none so <span class="smcap lowercase">DUSTY</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Dutch</b>, or <span class="smcap">Double Dutch</span>, gibberish, or any foreign tongue. “To talk
<span class="smcap">Double Dutch</span> backwards on a Sunday” is a humorous locution for
extraordinary linguistic facility.</p>

<p><b><a id="Dutch_auction"></a>Dutch auction</b>, a method of selling goods, adopted by “<span class="smcap lowercase">CHEAP
JOHNS</span>,” to evade the penalties for selling without a licence. The
article is offered all round at a high price, which is then dropped until
it is taken. <span class="smcap">Dutch auctions</span> need not be illegitimate transactions,
and their economy (as likewise that of puffing) will be found minutely
explained in Sugden (Lord St. Leonards) “On Vendors and Purchasers.”</p>

<p><b>Dutch concert</b>, where each performer plays a different tune. Sometimes
called a <span class="smcap">Dutch medley</span> when vocal efforts only are used.</p>

<p><b>Dutch consolation</b>, “thank God it is no worse.” “It might have
been worse,” said a man whom the devil was carrying to hell.
“How?” asked a neighbour. “Well, he’s carrying me&mdash;he might
have made me carry him.”</p>

<p><b>Dutch courage</b>, false courage, generally excited by drink&mdash;pot-valour.</p>

<p><b>Dutch feast</b>, where the host gets drunk before his guest.</p>

<p><b>Dutch uncle</b>, a personage often introduced in conversation, but
exceedingly difficult to describe; “I’ll talk to him like a <span class="smcap">Dutch

<p>“‘What do you mean by the Earl of Cork?’ asked Mr. Squander. ‘The ace of

Ireland.’”&mdash;<i>Carleton’s Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry.</i></p></div>

<p><b>Early</b>, “to get up <span class="smcap lowercase">EARLY</span>,” to prepare for a difficult task. “You’ll
have to get up very <span class="smcap lowercase">EARLY</span> in the morning to beat that.” Early
rising and ability seem also closely connected by certain modifications
of this expression. Possibly the belief is that a man who rises early
for early rising’s sake deserves to be clever. Perhaps the greatest
enjoyment a day labourer&mdash;whose work commences at six in the winter
mornings, and who may have to rise at half-past four and trudge off&mdash;can
have, is a “quiet snooze” after the usual time of rising. The
early rising in “the steel” is the chief terror of that institution in the
minds of habitual criminals.</p>

<p><b>Earwig</b>, a clergyman, also one who prompts another maliciously and
privately.</p>

<p><b>Earwigging</b>, a private conversation; a rebuke in private; an attempt

<div><p><b>Eavesdropper</b>, a listener. The name is derived from the punishment

Americanism. Bartlett gives conflicting examples. General now,
however. A modification of this is “having seen the king.” When a
man becomes aware that he has been cheated or imposed on, and does
not mean to stand it any longer, he is said to have seen the king, <i>i.e.</i>,
to have seen his adversary’s best card, and to be prepared for it.</p>

<p><b>Elevated</b>, intoxicated. <span class="smcap">Elevation</span> is the name of a drug-mixture
much used in the fen-counties for keeping up the spirits and preventing
ague. It consists mainly of opium.</p>

<p><b>Everlasting staircase</b>, the treadmill. Sometimes, but very rarely
now called “Colonel Chesterton’s <span class="smcap lowercase">EVERLASTING STAIRCASE</span>,” from
the gallant inventor or improver. Also known as “the <span class="smcap lowercase">STEPPER</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Exasperate</b>, to over-aspirate the letter <span class="smcap lowercase">H</span>, or to aspirate it whenever it
commences a word, as is commonly done by under-educated people
who wish to show off their breeding. <span class="smcap">Exasperation</span> does not refer
to an omission of the aspirate.</p>

<p><b>Exes</b>, expenses. “Just enough to clear our exes.”</p>

as distinguished from free-list entry.</p>

<p><b>Facer</b>, a blow on the face. In Ireland, a dram.</p>

<p><b>Facer</b>, a tumbler of whisky-punch. Possibly from the suffusion of blood

From <span class="smcap lowercase">FAG</span>, to become weary or tired out. <i>Low German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FAKK</span>,
wearied.</p>

<p><b>Fag</b>, to beat.</p>

<p><b><a id="Faggot2"></a>Faggot</b>, a bundle of bits of the “stickings” (hence probably its name)
sold for food to the London poor. It is sometimes called a duck. In
appearance it resembles a Scotch “haggis,” without, however, being
nearly so good as that fragrant article. Probably the <span class="smcap lowercase">FAG-END</span> of a
thing, the inferior or remaining part, the refuse.</p>

<p><b><a id="Faggot"></a>Faggot</b>, a term of opprobrium used by low people to children and women;
“you little <span class="smcap lowercase">FAGGOT</span>, you!” <span class="smcap">Faggot</span> was originally a term of contempt
for a dry shrivelled old woman, whose bones were like a bundle of
sticks, only fit to burn.&mdash;Compare the French expression for a heretic,
<i>sentir le fagot</i>.</p>

<p><b>Faggot briefs</b>, bundles of worthless papers tied up with red tape,
carried by unemployed barristers in the back rows of the courts to
simulate briefs.</p>

<p><b>Faggot vote</b>, a phrase which belongs to the slang of politics, and which
was applied to a class of votes, by no means extinct even now, though
not so common as in the days preceding the first Reform Bill, when
constituencies were smaller, and individual votes were consequently
more valuable. <span class="smcap">Faggot votes</span> were thus created:&mdash;A large landowner
who was blessed with, say, seven sons and seven brothers, and had also
on his estate fourteen labourers’ cottages worth about a shilling a week
each, would go through the form of sale of one cottage to each son
and each brother, it being perfectly understood that the title-deeds
would be returned when the occasion for their use was at an end. And
thus the squire would command fifteen votes instead of one. In a
famous election for the West Riding of Yorkshire during the third
decade of the present century, which cost upwards of half a million
sterling, and ruined the successful candidate, it was said that six hundred
<span class="smcap lowercase">FAGGOT VOTES</span> were created by three noble lords. The origin of the
term has been variously explained. One ingenious writer has suggested
that as a <span class="smcap lowercase">FAGGOT</span> may be split into a bundle of sticks, so was one
estate thus split into a bundle of votes. It is, however, more reasonable
to suppose that it was derived from the old word “<span class="smcap lowercase">FAGGOT</span>,”
which was used to describe a “nominal soldier,” one, that is,
whose name appeared on the muster-roll, and for whom the colonel
drew pay, but who was never to be found in the ranks. The connexion
is evident enough.</p>

<p><b>Fake</b>, in the sporting world, means to hocus or poison. Fake is also a
mixture supposed to be used for purposes of “making safe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fake</b>, to cheat, or swindle; to do anything; to go on, or continue; to
make or construct; to steal or rob,&mdash;a verb variously used. <span class="smcap">Faked</span>,
done, or done for; “<span class="smcap lowercase">FAKE</span> away, there’s no down;” go on, there is
nobody looking. From the <i>Latin</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">FACERE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Fakement</b>, a false begging petition, any act of robbery, swindling, or
deception. <span class="smcap">Fakement</span> is a word of most general application among
the lower classes. Any things strange, and most things not strange, are
called <span class="smcap lowercase">FAKEMENTS</span>, particularly if there is anything peculiar or artistic
in their production.</p>

<p><b>Fakement Charley</b>, the owner’s private mark. <span class="smcap">Faker</span>, is one
who makes or <span class="smcap lowercase">FAKES</span> anything. To “fake a cly,” is to pick a
pocket.</p>

<p><b>Fal-lals</b>, trumpery ornaments, gewgaws. Forby suggests as a derivation
the <i>Latin</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">PHALERÆ</span>, horse trappings.</p>

<p><b>Fambles</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FAMMS</span>, the hands.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i> <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FANGEN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Family men</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">PEOPLE</span>, thieves, or burglars.</p>

<p><b>Fan</b>, a waistcoat.&mdash;<i>Houndsditch term.</i></p>

<p><b>Fancy</b>, the favourite sports, pets, or pastime of a person, the ton of low
life. Pugilists are sometimes termed the <span class="smcap lowercase">FANCY</span>. Shakspeare uses
the word in the sense of a favourite or pet; and the paramour of a
prostitute is still called her <span class="smcap lowercase">FANCY MAN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Fancy bloak</b>, a fancy or sporting man.</p>

<p><b>Fanning</b>, a beating. <span class="smcap">Fanning</span> is also stealing; <span class="smcap lowercase">CROSS-FANNING</span> is
stealing with the arms crossed so as to distract attention, as in stealing
breast-pins, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Fanqui</b>, a European, literally foreign devil.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

<p><b>Fantail</b>, a dustman’s or coalheaver’s hat. So called from the shape.</p>

<p><b>Farm</b>, to contract, after the manner of those who engage to feed and
lodge children belonging to the parish, at so much a head; a
fruitful cause of starvation and misery. <i>See</i> <i>Oliver Twist.</i> The
baby farmings, unconnected with the parishes in which they occurred,
which ultimately resulted in the trial and execution of Margaret
Waters, on the 11th October, 1870, have caused the word <span class="smcap lowercase">FARM</span> as
applied to any dealings with children, parish or private, to be one of
obloquy and reproach.</p>

<p><b>Farmer.</b> In Suffolk this term is applied to the eldest son of the occupier
of the farm. In London it is used derisively of a countryman, and
denotes a farm-labourer or clodpole. Both senses are different from
the proper meaning.</p>

<p><b>Fast</b>, gay, spreeish, unsteady, thoughtless,&mdash;an Americanism that has of
late ascended from the streets to the drawing-room. The word has
certainly now a distinct meaning, which it had not thirty years ago.
<span class="smcap">Quick</span> is the synonym for <span class="smcap lowercase">FAST</span>, but a <span class="smcap lowercase">QUICK MAN</span> would not convey
the meaning of a <span class="smcap lowercase">FAST MAN</span>,&mdash;a person who, by late hours, gaiety, and
continual rounds of pleasure, lives too fast, and wears himself out. In
polite society a <span class="smcap lowercase">FAST</span> young lady is one who affects mannish habits, or
makes herself conspicuous by some unfeminine accomplishment,&mdash;talks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
slang, drives about in London, smokes cigarettes, is knowing in
dogs, horses, &amp;c. An amusing anecdote is told of a fast young lady,
the daughter of a right reverend prelate, who was an adept in horseflesh.
Being desirous of ascertaining the opinion of a candidate for
ordination, who had the look of a bird of the same feather, as to the
merits of some cattle just brought to her father’s palace for her to
select from, she was assured by him they were utterly unfit for a lady’s
use. With a knowing look at the horses’ points, she gave her decision
in these choice words, “Well, I agree with you; they <i>are</i> a rum lot,
as the devil said of the ten commandments.” Charles Dickens once
said that “fast,” when applied to a young man, was only another
word for loose, as he understood the term; and a fast girl has been
defined as a woman who has lost her respect for men, and for whom
men have lost their respect.</p>

<p><b>Fast</b>, embarrassed, wanting money, tied up. Sometimes synonymous
with “hard up.”&mdash;<i>Yorkshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Fast and loose</b>, to play <span class="smcap lowercase">FAST AND LOOSE</span> with a man, is to treat
him as a fast friend in the days while he is useful, and to cast
him loose when he is no longer necessary; also, to equivocate or
vacillate. In old days it was the name of a vulgar pastime. <i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Prick_the_garter">PRICK THE GARTER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Fat</b>, a printer’s term signifying the void spaces on a page, for which he is
paid at the same rate as for full or unbroken pages. Occasionally called
“grease,” and applied variously, but always as showing some undue or
uncommon amount of advantage.</p>

<p><b>Fat</b>, rich, abundant, &amp;c.; “a <span class="smcap lowercase">FAT</span> lot;” “to cut it <span class="smcap lowercase">FAT</span>,” to exaggerate, to
show off in an extensive or grand manner, to assume undue importance;
“cut up <span class="smcap lowercase">FAT</span>,” see under <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Cut">CUT</a></span>. As a theatrical term, a part with plenty
of <span class="smcap lowercase">FAT</span> in it is one which affords the actor an opportunity of effective
display.</p>

<p><b>Father</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fence">FENCE</a></span>, a buyer of stolen property.</p>

<p><b>Favourite</b>, the horse that has the lowest odds laid against it in the
betting list. When the <span class="smcap lowercase">FAVOURITE</span> wins, the public or backers of
horses generally are the gainers. When an outsider wins, the ring,
that is to say, the persons who make a business of laying against the
chances of horses, are the gainers.</p>

<p><b>Fawney</b>, a finger ring. <i>Irish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FAINEE</span>, a ring.</p>

<p><b><a id="Fawney_bouncing"></a>Fawney bouncing</b>, selling rings for a pretended wager. This
practice is founded upon the old tale of a gentleman laying a wager
that if he were to offer “real gold sovereigns” at a penny a-piece at
the foot of London Bridge, the English public would be too
incredulous to buy. The story states that the gentleman stationed
himself with sovereigns on a tea-tray, and sold only two within
the hour, thus winning the bet. This tale the <span class="smcap lowercase">FAWNEY BOUNCERS</span>
tell the public, only offering brass, double-gilt rings, instead of
sovereigns.</p>

<p><b>Fawney rig</b>, the ring-dropping trick. A few years ago this practice was
very common. A fellow purposely dropped a ring, or a pocket-book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with some little articles of jewellery, &amp;c., in it, and when he saw any
person pick it up, ran to claim half. The ring found, the question of
how the booty was to be divided had then to be decided. The sharper
says, “If you will give me eight or nine shillings for my share, the
things are yours.” This the “flat” thinks very fair. The ring of
course is valueless, and the swallower of the bait discovers the trick
too late. For another way of doing this trick, <i>see</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Ringdropping">RING-DROPPING</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Feathers</b>, money, wealth; “in full <span class="smcap lowercase">FEATHER</span>,” rich. <span class="smcap">Feathers</span> is also
a term applied to dress; “in full <span class="smcap lowercase">FEATHER</span>,” means very often in full
costume. It also means, at times, in high spirits.</p>

<p><b>Feed</b>, a meal, generally a dinner. Originally stable slang, now pretty
general.</p>

<p><b>Feele</b>, a daughter, or child.&mdash;Corrupted <i>French</i>.</p>

<p><b>Fellow-commoner</b>, uncomplimentary epithet used at Cambridge for
an empty bottle.</p>

<p><b>Felt</b>, a hat.&mdash;<i>Old term</i>, in use in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p><b><a id="Fence"></a>Fence</b>, a purchaser or receiver of stolen goods; also, the shop or warehouse
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">FENCER</span>.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Fen-nightingales</b>, toads and frogs, from their continued croaking at
night.</p>

<p><b>Feringee</b>, a European&mdash;that is, a Frank.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Ferricadouzer</b>, a knock-down blow, a good thrashing. Probably
derived, through the <i>Lingua Franca</i>, from the <i>Italian</i>, “far’ cader’
douser,” to knock down. “Far’ cader’ morto,” is to knock down dead.</p>

<p><b>Few</b>, used to signify the reverse, thus:&mdash;“Don’t you call this considerably
jolly?” “I believe you, my bo-o-oy, <span class="smcap lowercase">A FEW</span>.” Sometimes the reply is,
“just a <span class="smcap lowercase">FEW</span>.” Another expression of the same kind is <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Rather">RATHER</a></span>,
which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Fib</b>, to beat or strike.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Fib</b>, to lie, to romance.</p>

<p><b>Fibbing</b>, a series of blows delivered quickly, and at a short distance.&mdash;<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>

<p><b>Fiddle</b>, a sharper, “a street mugger.” In America, a swindle or an
imposture.</p>

<p><b>Fiddle</b>, “to play second <span class="smcap lowercase">FIDDLE</span>,” to act subordinately, or follow the
lead of another. From the orchestral practice.</p>

<p><b>Fiddle-face</b>, a person with a wizened countenance.</p>

<p><b>Fiddle-faddle</b>, twaddle, or trifling discourse.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Fiddler</b>, a sharper, a cheat; also a careless, negligent, or dilatory person.
On board some ocean steamers the <span class="smcap lowercase">FIDDLER</span> is the capstan-house, the
only place on board where passengers are permitted to smoke. The
term <span class="smcap lowercase">FIDDLER</span> is easily traceable to the fact that, while the seamen are
working the capstan-bars, a man sometimes plays on the fiddle to cheer
them at their toil.</p>

<p><b>Fiddler</b>, a sixpence. Fiddler’s money is small money; generally from
the old custom of each couple at a dance paying the fiddler sixpence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fiddler</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FADGE</span>, a farthing.</p>

<p><b>Fiddlers’ green</b>, the place where sailors expect to go when they
die. It is a place of fiddling, dancing, rum, and tobacco, and is undoubtedly
the “Land of Cocaigne,” mentioned in mediæval manuscripts.
A story is told of a drunken sailor who heard a street
preacher threatening all listeners with eternal damnation, and who
went up and asked where he (the sailor) was going after death. “To
hell, of course,” replied the preacher. “No, you lubberly son of a
sea-cook!” shouted the seaman, knocking the itinerant down; “I’m
going to <span class="smcap lowercase">FIDDLER’S GREEN</span>; and if you say I’m not, I’ll throttle you.”
Under compulsion, the preacher admitted the existence of <span class="smcap lowercase">FIDDLER’S
GREEN</span>, <i>pro tempore</i>.</p>

<p><b>Fiddles</b>, transverse pieces of wood used on shipboard to protect the
dishes at table during stormy weather. Swing tables obviate the
use of <span class="smcap lowercase">FIDDLES</span>.</p>

<p><b>Fiddle-sticks!</b> an exclamation signifying nonsense. Sometimes
“Fiddle-de-dee.”</p>

<p><b>Fiddling</b>, doing any odd jobs in the streets, holding horses, carrying
parcels, &amp;c., for a living. Among the middle classes, <span class="smcap lowercase">FIDDLING</span> means
idling away time, or trifling, and amongst sharpers it means gambling.</p>

<p><b>Fid-fad</b>, a game similar to chequers, or drafts, played in the West of
England.</p>

<p><b>Field</b>, the whole of the runners in a race of any kind. “A <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span> of
fourteen runners was placed in care of the starter.” In betting
phraseology the <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span> represents the bulk of the horses, as opposed to
the favourite. “The <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span> for a pony,” means that the offerer will
lay 25<i>l.</i> against the favourite, preferring the chances of a winner
turning up amongst the others. “Ten to one on the <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span>,” means
that the price named can be obtained about any horse in the race, that
being the lowest figure or favourite’s price. Laying against favourites
is called <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELDING</span>, and bookmakers are often known as <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELDERS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Field</b>, “to look out,” at cricket. In the outings of an eleven the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIELDERS</span> are those who stand away from the wickets with a view to
checking the progress of the ball. <span class="smcap">Fielding</span> is a great essential to
cricket, and to be “a good <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span>” is no slight honour. Also to lay
against favourites in the betting.</p>

<p><b>Field-lane duck</b>, a baked sheep’s head. Field Lane was a low
London thoroughfare leading from the foot of Holborn Hill to the
purlieus of Clerkenwell. It was formerly the market for stolen pocket-handkerchiefs.
Holborn Viaduct improved all but a small portion of
Field Lane off the face of the earth. There is but the smallest vestige
of this famous (or infamous) thoroughfare left. The neighbourhood
has received an upheaval within the past few years, and from one end
the pedestrian must descend to the remains of Field Lane by means
of a flight of steps.</p>

<p><b>Fieri-facias.</b> A red-faced man is often jocularly said to have been served
with a writ of <span class="smcap lowercase">FIERI-FACIAS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Fi-fa</b>, a writ of Fieri-Facias.&mdash;<i>Legal.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fi-fi</b>, Thackeray’s term for Paul de Kock’s novels, and similar modern
French literature.</p>

<p><b>Fig</b>, “in full <span class="smcap lowercase">FIG</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, full-dress costume, “extensively got up.” Possibly
an allusion to the dress assumed by our first parents after they
were naked and not ashamed, or else an abbreviation of figure, in the
references to plates in books of fashions.</p>

<p><b>Fig</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">FIG</span> a horse,” to play improper tricks with one in order to make
him lively. The <span class="smcap lowercase">FIG</span> is a piece of wet ginger placed under a horse’s tail
for the purpose of making him appear lively, and enhance his price.</p>

<p><b>Figaro</b>, a barber; from <i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i>.</p>

<p><b>Fig-leaf</b>, a small apron worn by ladies.</p>

<p><b>Figure</b>, “to cut a good or bad <span class="smcap lowercase">FIGURE</span>,” to make good or indifferent
appearance; “what’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">FIGURE</span>?” how much is to pay? <span class="smcap">Figure-head</span>,
a person’s face.&mdash;<i>Sea term.</i></p>

<p><b>Filch</b>, to steal, or purloin. Originally a cant word, derived from the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FILCHES</span>, or hooks, thieves used to carry, to hook clothes, or any
portable articles from open windows.&mdash;<i>Vide</i> Decker. It was considered
a cant or gipsy term up to the beginning of the last century. Harman
has “<span class="smcap lowercase">FYLCHE</span>, to robbe.” Probably from “<span class="smcap lowercase">FILICHI</span>,” Romany for
a handkerchief.</p>

<p><b>File</b>, a deep or artful man, a jocose name for a cunning person. Originally
a term for a pickpocket, when to <span class="smcap lowercase">FILE</span> was to cheat or rob.
<span class="smcap">File</span>, an artful man, was used in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. To deal with an artful man is sometimes said to be like
biting a <span class="smcap lowercase">FILE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Filibuster</b>, an American adventurer, who, if successful, helps to extend
the boundaries of the United States, becomes a General, and receives
high honours, but who remains a <span class="smcap lowercase">FILIBUSTER</span>, and is despised as such,
if he fails. The Texan, Nicaraguan, and kindred expeditions were of
a <span class="smcap lowercase">FILIBUSTERING</span> order.</p>

<p><b>Fillibrush</b>, to flatter, praise ironically.</p>

<p><b>Fimble-famble</b>, a lame, prevaricating excuse.&mdash;<i>Scandinavian.</i></p>

<p><b>Fin</b>, a hand; “come, tip us your <span class="smcap lowercase">FIN</span>,” viz., let us shake hands.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

is always ready to fight.</p>

<p><b>Firkytoodle</b>, to cuddle or fondle.</p>

<p><b>First flight</b>, the first lot to finish in a foot or horse race, in a fox
hunt, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Fish</b>, a person; “a queer <span class="smcap lowercase">FISH</span>,” “a loose <span class="smcap lowercase">FISH</span>.” Term never used
except in doubtful cases, as those quoted.</p>

<p><b>Fishfag</b>, originally a Billingsgate fishwife; now any scolding, vixenish,
foul-mouthed woman.</p>

<p><b>Fishy</b>, doubtful, unsound, rotten; used to denote a suspicion of a “screw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
being loose,” or “something rotten in the state of Denmark,” in
referring to any proposed speculation.</p>

<p><b>Fit</b>, an Americanism denoting the preterite of the verb to fight. A
Yankee once came upon the words <i>nihil fit</i>, and he immediately wrote
off to the editor of the paper to which he subscribed to know “Who
was Nihil, who he fit, what amount he fit for, and if he won.”</p>

<p><b>Five fingers</b>, the five of trumps, at the game of Five-cards, or Don.</p>

<p><b>Fives</b>, “bunch of <span class="smcap lowercase">FIVES</span>,” the fist.</p>

<p><b>Fix</b>, a predicament, or dilemma; “an awful <span class="smcap lowercase">FIX</span>,” a terrible position;
“to <span class="smcap lowercase">FIX</span> one’s flint for him,” <i>i.e.</i>, to “settle his hash,” to “put a
spoke in his wheel.”</p>

<p><b>Fixings</b>, an Americanism, equivalent to our word “<a href="#Trimmings">trimmings</a>,” which
<i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Fiz</b>, champagne; any sparkling wine.</p>

<p><b>Fizzing</b>, first-rate, very good, excellent; synonymous with “stunning.”</p>

<p><b>Flabbergast</b>, or <span class="smcap">Flabberghast</span>, to astonish, or strike with wonder;
literally, to strike aghast.&mdash;<i>Old.</i></p>

<p><b>Flag</b>, a groat, or 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Flag</b>, an apron. People who wear their aprons when not at work, are
called “flag-flashers.”</p>

<p><b>Flag of distress</b>, any overt sign of poverty; the end of a person’s
shirt when it protrudes through his trousers.</p>

<p><b>Flam</b>, nonsense, blarney, a lie, humbug. “A regular <span class="smcap lowercase">FLAM</span>,” a tale
devoid of truth.</p>

<p><b>Flame</b>, a sweetheart.</p>

<p><b><a id="Flannel"></a>Flannel</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">HOT FLANNEL</span>, the old term for gin and beer, drunk hot,
with nutmeg, sugar, &amp;c.; a play on the old name “lambswool.” Also
called “flip.” There is an anecdote told of Goldsmith helping to drink
a quart of <span class="smcap lowercase">FLANNEL</span> in a night-house, in company with George Parker,
Ned Shuter, and a demure, grave-looking gentleman, who continually
introduced the words “crap,” “stretch,” “scrag,” and “swing.” Upon
the Doctor asking who this strange person might be, and being told
his profession, he rushed from the place in a frenzy, exclaiming, “Good
God! and have I been sitting all this while with a hangman!”</p>

<p><b>Flap</b>, lead used for the coverings of roofs.</p>

<p><b>Flapper</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FLIPPER</span>, the hand.</p>

<p><b>Flare up</b>, a jovial social gathering, a “breakdown,” a “row.”</p>

<div><p><b>Flash</b>, showy, smart, knowing; a word with various meanings. A person
is said to be dressed <span class="smcap lowercase">FLASH</span> when his garb is showy, and after a fashion,
but without taste. A person is said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">FLASH</span> when he apes the
appearance or manners of his betters, or when he is trying to be
superior to his friends and relations. <span class="smcap">Flash</span> also means “fast,”
roguish, and sometimes infers counterfeit or deceptive&mdash;and this,
perhaps, is its general signification. As it is used by those who best
understand it nowadays, the word means that which is not what it
appears to be&mdash;anything spurious, as jewellery and shoddy clothes.
“<span class="smcap">Flash</span>, my young friend, or slang, as others call it, is the classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
language of the Holy Land; in other words, St. Giles’s Greek.”&mdash;<i>Tom
and Jerry</i>, by Moncreiff. Vulgar language was first termed
<span class="smcap lowercase">FLASH</span> in the year 1718, by Hitchin, author of “<i>The Regulator of
Thieves, &amp;c., with account of flash words</i>.” “<span class="smcap">Flash</span>” is sometimes
exchangeable with “fancy.”</p>

<p><b>Flash it</b>, show it&mdash;said when any bargain is offered.</p>

<p><b>Flash o’ lightning</b>, the gold band on an officer’s cap.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i> Also in
street slang, a glass of gin.</p>

<p><b>Flat</b>, a fool, a silly or “soft” person; the opposite of “sharp.” The terms
appear to be shortenings for “sharp-witted” and “flat-witted.” Or,
maybe, from musical notes.</p>

<p><b>Flat-feet</b>, the battalion companies in the Foot Guards.</p>

<p><b>Flats</b>, playing cards; sometimes called “broads.” Also the storeys of
large houses, built on the “independent” principle, each flat having its
separate and peculiar offices, street-door, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Flatty</b>, a rustic, or uninitiated person.</p>

<p><b>Flatty-ken</b>, a public-house the landlord of which is ignorant of the
practices of the thieves and tramps who frequent it.</p>

<p><b>Flay the fox</b>, to vomit. Now replaced by the more popular “shoot
the cat.”</p>

<p><b>Flemish account.</b>&mdash;<i>Old.</i> Still used by sailors for a tangled and unsatisfactory
account or reckoning.</p>

<p><b>Flesh and blood</b>, brandy and port in equal quantities.</p>

<p><b>Flesh bag</b>, a shirt. American humourists call a white shirt a “clean
biled rag.” In the mining camps, and rough parts generally, a white
shirt is called a “biled shirt” to distinguish it from the usual woollen
garment, which cannot be boiled.</p>

<p><b>Flick</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD FLICK</span>, a comical old chap or fellow. Term of endearment
among low people.</p>

<p><b>Flick</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FLIG</span>, to whip by striking, and drawing the lash back at the

of lies.</p>

<p><b>Flim-flamn</b>, idle story.&mdash;<i>Beaumont and Fletcher.</i></p>

<p><b>Flimp</b>, to hustle, or rob.</p>

<p><b>Flimsy</b>, a bank-note. Bank of Elegance notes are sometimes called soft
flimsies. In this particular case two good terms make a bad one, as
both “soft” and “flimsies” used separately refer to good notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Flimsy</b>, the thin prepared copying-paper used by newspaper reporters

in which the performer throws himself over on his hands and feet
alternately.</p>

<p><b>Flipper</b>, the hand; “give us your <span class="smcap lowercase">FLIPPER</span>,” give me your hand.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i>

<p><b>Floater</b>, a small suet dumpling put into soup.&mdash;<i>Whitechapel.</i></p>

<p><b>Floating academy</b>, the hulks.</p>

<p><b>Flog</b>, to whip. Cited both by Grose and the author of <i>Bacchus and Venus</i>
as a cant word. Many efforts have been made to ascertain the earliest
use; Richardson cites Lord Chesterfield. From <i>Flagellum</i>. “Flawged,”
for whipped, occurs in “The Presbyterian Lash, or Nockhoff’s Maid
Whipt,” published in 1663. Nockhoff was the anagram for the name
of the Rev. Zachary Crofton, who had scandalized the town by subjecting
his servant-maid to the discipline of the nursery. There is a good
story on the proper orthography of the convertible term for castigation
related in a newspaper of 1841. A county magistrate, who had sentenced
a boy to be birched, wrote in his warrant that the boy was to
be “floged.” The scrupulous gaoler hesitated to inflict the punishment,
and sent back the warrant to the justice for amendment, who
thereupon drew his pen through “floged,” and ordered the boy to be
“wiped.”</p>

<p><b>Flogger</b>, a whip.&mdash;<i>Almost obsolete.</i> <span class="smcap">Flogger</span> is still the term applied to

to “<a href="#Skied">skyed</a>,” which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Floorer</b>, a blow sufficiently strong to knock a man down, or bring him to

freemasonry, the sign chalked by rogues and tramps upon a
gate-post or house corner, to express to succeeding vagabonds that it is
unsafe for them to call there, is known as <img src="images/sg.jpg" alt="circle with dot" title="" class="symbol" />, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FLUMMUXED</span>, which
signifies that the only thing they would be likely to get upon applying
for relief would be a “month in quod.”&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Quod">QUOD</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Fogger</b>, a farm servant who feeds cattle. Probably a corruption of
fodderer.</p>

<p><b>Foggy</b>, tipsy.</p>

<p><b>Fogle</b>, a silk handkerchief,&mdash;not a clout, which is of cotton. It has been
hinted that this may have come from the German <i>Vogel</i>, a bird, from
the bird’s-eye spots on some handkerchiefs, but a more probable derivation
is the Italian slang (<i>Fourbesque</i>), <span class="smcap lowercase">FOGLIA</span>, a pocket, or purse;
or from the French Argot, <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUILLE</span>, also a pocket.</p>

<p><b>Forakers</b>, the closet of decency, or house of office. Term used by the
boys at Winchester School. Very likely from “four acres,” the
original necessary having been in all likelihood a field behind the
school.</p>

<p><b>Force the voucher</b>, a term in use among sporting tricksters, who
advertise to send certain winners, and on receipt of letters enclose
vouchers similar to those sent out by respectable commission agents,
but with double or treble the current odds marked thereon, in reference
to the horse named. A plausible letter is sent with the voucher,
and the victim is informed that on account of early investments made
by the firm, which has of course a high-sounding title, the extra odds
can be laid by them, and a remittance to the amount named, or
part of it, is requested. Of course the firm “dries up” when claims
become heavy, and, with a new name and new address, appears in the
next week’s advertising columns. <span class="smcap">Forcing the voucher</span> was a fine
game when it was first started, but it was soon overdone, as it required
no particular ingenuity, and offered special immunities, theft of this
kind being rather favoured than otherwise by the authorities. Certainly
the law that punishes honest betting men seems powerless with regard
to these plunderers, otherwise we should hardly be treated as often as
we are to the spectacle of one man being fined for honest dealing, while
another escapes simply because he is not a betting man, but a welcher.</p>

<p><b>Fork out</b>, to bring out one’s money, to pay the bill, to “stand for” or
treat a friend; to hand over what does not belong to you&mdash;old cant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
term for picking pockets, and very curious in its origin. In the early
part of the last century, a little book was published on purloining, and
of course it had to give the latest modes. <span class="smcap">Forking</span> was the newest
mode, and it consisted in thrusting the fingers stiff and open into the
pocket, and then quickly closing them and extracting any article thus
caught.</p>

<p><b>Forks</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAPPLING-IRONS</span>, fingers. Costermongers and other clumsy
feeders have a proverb which seems to justify their taking bones and
choice morsels in their hands during the progress of a meal. It is,
“Fingers were the first <span class="smcap lowercase">FORKS</span>;” sometimes varied to “Fingers were
made before <span class="smcap lowercase">FORKS</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Form</b>, condition, training. “In good <span class="smcap lowercase">FORM</span>” or “in bad <span class="smcap lowercase">FORM</span>” refers
to a man’s or horse’s state of being in the sporting world. <span class="smcap">Form</span> has
also had a moral significance of late years, and with the qualifying
adjectives attached as occasion requires, is extensively used in general
conversation. As, “It was bad <span class="smcap lowercase">FORM</span> of Brown to do that.” “That
article was bad <span class="smcap lowercase">FORM</span>.” In the latter cases the word “in” rarely appears.</p>

<p><b>Forty foot</b>, a derisive appellation for a very short person.</p>

<p><b>Forty guts</b>, vulgar term for a fat man.</p>

<p><b>Forty-twa</b>, the common place of retirement on a well-known French

<p><b>Foul</b>, to jostle or bore unfairly in a race. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bore">BORE</a></span>. To touch any foreign
substance during a race&mdash;particularly a boat-race&mdash;is to <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUL</span> it.</p>

<p><b>Foul</b>, a touch, no matter how slight, of bodies or machinery in a race of
any kind. <span class="smcap">Fouls</span> in boat-racing are often inevitable, and are not
always the result of boring or any other malicious practice.</p>

<p><b>Foul riding</b>, riding which after a horse-race is made the subject of
complaint, such as refusing to let a competitor pass, boring him against
the rails, &amp;c. Some jockeys are great adepts at this work, and are
invaluable to a confederacy as a means, not so much of attaining
victory themselves, as of preventing its attainment in others. Of course
unless proof of jostling can be given, or evidence of malicious intent
shown, jockeyship of this kind is not considered foul riding.</p>

<div><p><b>Four-and-nine</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUR-AND-NINEPENNY GOSS</span>, a cheap hat, so called
from 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, the price at which a once noted advertising hat-maker
sold his hats&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fourth</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FOURTH COURT</span>, the court appropriated to the waterclosets
at Cambridge; from its really being No. 4 at Trinity College. A man
leaving his room to go to the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOURTH COURT</span>, writes on his door, in
algebraic notation, <span class="smcap lowercase">GONE</span><sup>4</sup>, which expresses the Cambridge slang
phrase, “gone to the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOURTH</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Fourth estate</b>, the complete body of journalists of all descriptions.
This term is much in use among “liners.”</p>

<p><b>Free-and-easy</b>, a club held at a low public-house, the members of
which meet in the tap-room or parlour for the purpose of drinking,
smoking, and hearing each other sing. These gatherings are generally
called harmonic meetings by the landlord, but <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE-AND-EASY</span> best
indicates the character of the proceedings.</p>

<p><b>Free fight</b>, a fight conducted on the Irishman’s principle&mdash;“Sure,
wherever you see a head, hit it.” The term is, however, American,
so the practice may be considered fairly general.</p>

<p><b>Freeman’s quay</b>, “drinking at <span class="smcap">Freeman’s Quay</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, at another’s
cost. This quay was formerly a celebrated wharf near London Bridge,
and the saying arose from the beer which was given gratis to porters
and carmen who went there on business.</p>

<p><b>French cream</b>, brandy.</p>

<p><b>French gout</b>, a certain disease, which is also known as “ladies’ fever.”</p>

Junior Sophs or Sophisters. After this they are Senior Sophs until
their last term, when they are Questionists, or preparing “<i>ad respondendum
quæstioni</i>.” At Oxford the title <span class="smcap lowercase">FRESHMAN</span> lasts for the first
term.</p>

<p><b>Friday-face</b>, a gloomy-looking man. Most likely from <span class="smcap">Friday</span> being
a day of meagre fare among Catholics and High Church Protestants.</p>

pounce suddenly on delinquents.</p>

<p><b>Frog’s march</b>, the manner in which four or more policemen carry a
drunken or turbulent man to the station-house. The victim is held face
downwards, one constable being at each shoulder, while the others hold

<p><b><a id="F_sharps"></a>F sharps</b>, fleas. Compare <span class="smcap"><a href="#B_Flats">B flats</a></span>.</p>

<div><p><b>Fudge</b>, nonsense, stupidity. Todd and Richardson only trace the word
to Goldsmith. Disraeli, however, gives the origin to a Captain Fudge,
a great fibber, who told monstrous stories, which made his crew say in
answer to any improbability, “You <span class="smcap lowercase">FUDGE</span> it!”&mdash;<i>See Remarks on the
Navy</i>, 1700. At page 87 of a collection of some papers of William
Crouch (8vo, 1712), the Quaker, we find a mention of this Captain.
Degory Marshall informed Crouch that&mdash;</p>

deception.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Fuggies</b>, hot rolls.&mdash;<i>School.</i></p>

<p><b>Full against</b>, opposed to. As, “I’m <span class="smcap lowercase">FULL AGAINST</span> him,” I decidedly
object to, or dislike him, or I am opposed to him. The term originated
with the bookmakers; who, when they have laid all their
money against a certain horse, put a mark against his name, and reply
to all inquiries, “<span class="smcap lowercase">FULL AGAINST</span> him.” This grew to “<span class="smcap lowercase">FULL AGAINST</span>
his winning,” and was thus taken, when shortened, to express feeling
the reverse of friendly.</p>

<p><b>Fullams</b>, false dice, which always turn up high.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Full blast</b>, a term evidently borrowed from the technology of the
engine-room, and now frequently used to express the heyday or

BEANS.</span>” Originally stable slang.</p>

<p><b>Fully</b>, “to be <span class="smcap lowercase">FULLIED</span>,” to be committed for trial. Term in general
use among thieves. Possibly from the reports which, in the slang of
the penny-a-liner, say “the prisoner was <span class="smcap lowercase">FULLY</span> committed for trial.”
The magistrates often say <span class="smcap lowercase">FULLY</span> committed also, whatever that may
mean.</p>

assafœtida and cotton stuffed into a hollow tube or cow’s horn. The
cotton being lighted, the smoke is blown in through the keyhole of a

already mentioned, who think it absolutely needful to roar with laughter at
every sentence Mr. Robson utters, without the least regard to whether it be
humorous or pathetic&mdash;only because Mr. Robson has fame as a comic actor.</p></div>

<p>When another Robson shall arise, no one will object to his <span class="smcap lowercase">GAGGING</span> a
little. The public could afford that to such a man in these days of
“creations.”</p>
</div>

<p><b>Gag</b>, to hoax, “take a rise” out of one; to “cod.”</p>

<p><b>Gage</b>, a small quantity of anything; as “a <span class="smcap lowercase">GAGE</span> of tobacco,” meaning a
pipeful; “a <span class="smcap lowercase">GAGE</span> of gin,” a glassful. <span class="smcap">Gage</span> was, in the last century,
a chamber utensil.</p>

<p><b>Gamb</b>, a leg. Still used as an heraldic term, as well as by thieves, who
probably get it from the <i>Lingua Franca</i>. <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GAMBA</span>; <i>French</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">JAMBE</span>, a leg.</p>

<p><b>Game</b>, a term variously applied; “are you <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>?” have you courage
enough? “what’s your little <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>?” what are you going to do? “come,
none of your <span class="smcap lowercase">GAMES</span>,” be quiet, don’t annoy me; “on the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>,” out

thoroughly and properly.</p>

<p><b>Gammon</b>, deceit, humbug, a false and ridiculous story. <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAMEN</span>, game, sport.</p>

<p><b>Gammon</b>, to hoax, to deceive merrily, to laugh at a person, to tell an
untrue but plausible story, to make game of, or, in the provincial dialect,
to make <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> on;&mdash;“who’s thou makin’ thy <span class="smcap lowercase">GAM</span>’ on?” <i>i.e.</i>, of
whom are you making a fool?&mdash;<i>Yorkshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Gammy</b>, bad, unfavourable, poor tempered. Those householders who
are known enemies to the street folk and tramps are pronounced by
them to be <span class="smcap lowercase">GAMMY</span>. <span class="smcap">Gammy</span> sometimes means forged, as “<span class="smcap lowercase">GAMMY-MONNIKER</span>,”
a forged signature; <span class="smcap lowercase">GAMMY STUFF</span>, spurious medicine;
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAMMY LOWR</span>, counterfeit coin. <i>Hants</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GAMY</span>, dirty. The hieroglyphic

<span class="smcap lowercase">GAMMY</span>. <i>Gaelic</i>, <i>Welsh</i>, and <i>Irish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CAM</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">GAM</span>), crooked.</p>

<p><b>Gammy-vial</b> (Ville), a town where the police will not let persons

<p><b>Gander Month</b>, the period when the monthly nurse is in the ascendant,
and the husband has to shift for himself. Probably from the open
choice he has during that period.</p>

<p><b>Ganger</b>, the person who superintends the work of a gang, or a number
of navigators.</p>

<p><b>Gape</b>, to stare about in an astonished manner. “<span class="smcap lowercase">GAPING</span> about like a
country bumpkin.” Sometimes pronounced <span class="smcap lowercase">GARP</span>. There is no
reference in the use of this phrase by Cockneys to <span class="smcap lowercase">GAPE</span> in its correct
sense.</p>

<p><b>Gape-seed</b>, something to look at, cause for astonishment; a lazy fellow,
unmindful of his work, is said to be “looking for <span class="smcap lowercase">GAPE-SEED</span>.”
Rustics are said to find plenty of “<span class="smcap lowercase">GAPE-SEED</span>” in London streets.</p>

<p><b>Gar</b>, euphuistic rendering of the title of the Deity; “be <span class="smcap lowercase">GAR</span>, you don’t
say so!”&mdash;<i>Franco-English.</i></p>

<p><b>Garden</b>, among tradesmen signifies Covent <span class="smcap">Garden</span> Market; among
theatrical performers, Covent <span class="smcap">Garden</span> Theatre.</p>

<p><b>Gardener</b>, an awkward coachman; an insinuation that he is both coachman
and gardener, and understands the latter branch of service better
than the first; “get on, <span class="smcap lowercase">GARDENER</span>,” is a most insulting expression
from a cabby to a real coachman. Men who in small families do the
coach, garden, and general work, are sometimes called “teakettle
grooms,” or “teakettle coachmen.”</p>

<p><b>Gargle</b>, medical-student slang for drinkables.</p>

<p><b>Garnish</b>, the douceur or fee which, before the time of Howard the philanthropist,
was openly exacted by the keepers of gaols from their unfortunate
prisoners for extra comforts. The practice of garnishing
is by no means so defunct as some folk seem to think, and its influence
may often be traced by those who wish.</p>

<p><b>Garnish</b>, footing money.&mdash;<i>Yorkshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Garreter</b>, a thief who crawls over the tops of houses, and enters garret-windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Called also a “dancer,” or “dancing-master,” from the
light and airy nature of his occupation.</p>

<p><b>Garrotte</b>, a system of robbery with violence much practised on dark
winter nights by ruffians who during summer infest racecourses and
fairs. Their victims are generally weak men and delicate women.
From the Spanish <span class="smcap lowercase">GARROTTE</span>, because the practice generally commences
with a throttling attack. Procedure is, however, various, these
gentlemen being possessed of much ingenuity in the way of torture.
“The cat” has within the past year or so done much to modify this
offensive state of things, but the sympathetic appeals of certain tenderhearted
M.P.’s and other philanthropists, who are not themselves likely
to be garrotted, on behalf of the garrotters, will probably before
long result in a withdrawal of the <i>lex talionis</i>, and a natural resumption
of the garrotte system, with new adornments.</p>

<p><b>Garrotting</b>, a mode of cheating practised amongst card-sharpers, by
concealing certain cards at the back of the neck.</p>

<p><b><a id="Gas"></a>Gas</b>, to give off superfluous conceit, to bounce or brag; “his game is
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAS</span>.” “To give a person <span class="smcap lowercase">GAS</span>,” is to scold him or give him a good
beating. Synonymous with “to give him Jessie.”</p>

<p><b>Gassy</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">GASEOUS</span>, liable to “flare up” at any offence.</p>

<p><b>Gate</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">THE</span>, Billingsgate. Sometimes Newgate, according to the occupation
and condition of the speaker. In the same way Paternoster Row
is by publishers known as “the Row.”</p>

<p><b>Gate</b>, to order an undergrad not to pass beyond the college <span class="smcap lowercase">GATE</span>. As
a rule, the <span class="smcap lowercase">GATE</span> begins after hall, but in extreme cases the offender
is <span class="smcap lowercase">GATED</span> for the whole day.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Gate-race</b>, among pedestrians a mock race, got up not so much for the
best runner to win, as for the money taken from spectators, at the gate.
This sort of business is not peculiar to pedestrians; there are such things
as gate-money meetings at horse-racing.</p>

<div><p><b>Gatter</b>, beer; “shant of <span class="smcap lowercase">GATTER</span>,” a pot of beer. A curious slang
street melody, known in Seven Dials as <i>Bet the Coaley’s Daughter</i>, thus
mentions the word in a favourite verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But when I strove my flame to tell,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><b>Gaudy</b>, the annual dinner of the Fellows of a College, in memory of
founders and benefactors. From <span class="smcap lowercase">GAUDEAMUS</span>.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Gawfs</b>, cheap red-skinned apples, a favourite fruit with costermongers,
who rub them well with a piece of cloth, and find ready purchasers.</p>

<p><b>Gawky</b>, a lanky, or awkward person; a fool. <i>Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GEAK</span>; <i>Scotch</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GOWK</span>.</p>

<p><b>Gay</b>, loose, dissipated; “<span class="smcap lowercase">GAY</span> woman,” a kept mistress or prostitute.
Many people will remember Leech’s celebrated caricature of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
wretched females on an equally wretched night, and the question asked
by one woman of the other, “How long have you been <span class="smcap lowercase">GAY</span>?”</p>

<p><b>Gay tyke boy</b>, a dog-fancier.</p>

<p><b>Gee</b>, to agree with, or be congenial to a person.</p>

<p><b>Gen</b>, a shilling. <i>See</i> <a href="#Page_347">back-slang article</a>.</p>

<p><b>Gent</b>, a contraction of “gentleman,”&mdash;in more senses than one. A dressy,
showy, foppish man, with a little mind, who vulgarizes the prevailing
fashion.</p>

<p><b>Gent</b>, silver. From the <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ARGENT</span>.</p>

<p><b>Gentleman of four outs;</b> in Ireland when a vulgar, blustering
fellow asserts that he is a gentleman, the retort generally is, “Yes, a
<span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMAN OF FOUR OUTS</span>”&mdash;that is, without wit, without money,
without credit, and without manners.</p>

<p><b>Gentleman of three ins</b>,&mdash;that is, in debt, in danger, and in
poverty.</p>

<p><b><a id="Geordie"></a>Geordie</b>, general term in Northumberland and Durham for a pitman, or
coal-miner. From the <i>Greek</i>, <span class="smcap">George</span> meaning one who works the
earth, originally a cultivator; the term has been in use more than a
century.</p>

<p><b>German Duck</b>, a sheep’s-head stewed with onions; a favourite dish
among the German sugar-bakers in the East-end of London.</p>

<p><b>German Ducks</b>, bugs.&mdash;<i>Yorkshire.</i></p>

<div><p><b>Get up</b>, a person’s appearance or general arrangements. Probably
derived from the decorations of a play.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There’s so much <span class="smcap lowercase">GETTING UP</span> to please the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It takes a precious deal of coming down.”<br /></span>

<span class="sig"><i>Planché’s Mr. Buckstone’s Ascent of Parnassus.</i><br /></span>

<p><b>Ghost</b>, “the <span class="smcap lowercase">GHOST</span> doesn’t walk,” a theatrical term which implies that
there is no money about, and that there will be no “treasury.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Gibberish"></a>Gibberish</b>, unmeaning jargon; the language of the gipsies, synonymous
with <span class="smcap lowercase">SLANG</span>, another Gipsy word. Somner says, “<i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GABBER</span>;
<i>Dutch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GABBEREN</span>; and our own <span class="smcap lowercase">GAB</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GABBER</span>; hence also, I take it,
our <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBERISH</span>, a kind of canting language used by a sort of rogues we
vulgarly call gipsies, a gibble-gabble understood only among themselves.”
<i>See <a href="#Page_1">Introduction</a>.</i> The <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBERISH</span> of schoolboys is formed
by placing a consonant between each syllable of a word, and is called
the <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBERISH</span> of the letter inserted. Thus, if F were the letter,
it would be termed the F <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBERISH</span>; if L, the L <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBERISH</span>&mdash;as in
the sentence, “How do you do?&mdash;<i>Howl dol youl dol?</i>” A <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBERISH</span>
is sometimes formed by adding <i>vis</i> to each word, in which the previous
sentence would be&mdash;“<i>Howvis dovis youvis dovis?</i>” These things are
worthy of schoolboys, as they are in ability far below the rhyming, the
back, or the centre slang, each of which is constructed by people possessing
no claim to literary excellence whatever. Schoolboys in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
form a <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBERISH</span>, in a somewhat similar manner, by elongating their
words two syllables, in the first of which an <i>r</i>, in the second a <i>g</i>, predominates.
Thus the words <i>vous êtes un fou</i> are spoken, <i>vousdregue
esdregue undregue foudregue</i>. Fast persons in Paris, of both sexes,
frequently adopt terminations of this kind, from some popular song,
actor, exhibition, or political event. In 1830, the favourite termination
was <i>mar</i>, saying <i>épicemar</i> for épicier, <i>cafémar</i> for café. In 1823,
when the diorama created a sensation in Paris, the people spoke in
<i>rama</i> (<i>on parlait en rama</i>.) In Balzac’s beautiful tale, <i>Le Père Goriot</i>,
the young painter at the boarding-house dinner-table mystifies the
landlady by saying, “What a beautiful <i>soupeaurama</i>!” To which the
old woman replies, to the great laughter of the company, “I beg your
pardon, sir, it is <i>une soupe à choux</i>.” These adaptations can hardly be
called slang, or we shall have everybody making a slang of his own,
and refusing to believe in any one’s else&mdash;a sort of secondhand edition
of the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p><b>Gib-face</b>, a heavy, ugly face; <span class="smcap lowercase">GIB</span> is properly the lower lip of a horse;
“to hang one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">GIB</span>,” to pout the lower lip, to be angry or sullen.</p>

<p><b>Gibus</b>, an opera hat. From the inventor of the crush hat.</p>

<p><b>Giffle-gaffle</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">GIBBLE-GABBLE</span>, nonsense. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Chaff">CHAFF</a></span>. <i>Icelandic</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GAFLA</span>.</p>

<p><b>Gig</b>, a farthing. Formerly <span class="smcap lowercase">GRIG</span>.</p>

<div><p><b>Gig</b>, fun, frolic, a spree. <i>Old French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GIGUE</span>, a jig, a romp.</p>

<p><b>Gig lamps</b>, spectacles; also a person who wears spectacles is often
called <span class="smcap lowercase">GIG-LAMPS</span>. Connexion obvious. This term has been in use
probably as long as <span class="smcap lowercase">GIG-LAMPS</span> themselves&mdash;if <span class="smcap lowercase">GIG-LAMPS</span> were invented
after spectacles.</p>

<p><b>Gill</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">JILL</span>, a homely woman; “Jack and Gill,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Gills</b>, the lower part of the face.&mdash;<i>Bacon.</i> “To grease one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">GILLS</span>,”
“to have a good feed,” or make a hearty meal. A man suffering from

spruce wench.”&mdash;<i>New Bailey.</i> Any things which are gaudy and
easily breakable, are known now as <span class="smcap lowercase">GIMCRACKS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Ginger</b>, a showy, fast horse&mdash;as if he had been figged with <span class="smcap lowercase">GINGER</span>
under his tail; a red-haired man. Term commonly used in depreciation
of a person’s appearance.</p>

<p><b>Ginger hackled</b>, having flaxen, light yellow hair. Term originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
used to describe a certain colour or colours in game-cocks.&mdash;<i>See</i>

<p><b>Gingham</b>, an umbrella. Term very common in London.</p>

<p><b>Gingumbob</b>, a bauble.</p>

<p><b>Gin-spinner</b>, a distiller, or rectifier of gin.</p>

<p><b>Give</b>, to strike, to scold; “I’ll <span class="smcap lowercase">GIVE</span> it to you,” <i>i.e.</i>, I will thrash you.
To lead to, in the sense of directions. Thus, in one of the Christmas
numbers of <i>All the Year Round</i> we are told that “a side portal and a
passage, dark at noon, <span class="smcap lowercase">GAVE</span> upon Paradise Alley.” This usage of the
word, from the French idiomatic use of <i>donner</i>, is becoming by no
means uncommon.</p>

<p><b>Give in</b>, to admit oneself defeated, to “throw up the sponge,” or “strike
one’s flag.”</p>

<p><b>Give it mouth</b>, a rude request to an actor or orator, which means,
speak up. Low folk can fancy nothing higher in the way of encomium
on an actor than, “He’s the cove to <span class="smcap lowercase">GIVE IT MOUTH</span>&mdash;rather!”</p>

<p><b>Gladstone</b>, cheap claret. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> reduced the duty on French wines.</p>

<p><b>Glasgow magistrate</b>, a salt herring. When George IV. visited
Scotland, a wag placed some salt herrings on the iron guard of the
carriage belonging to a well-known <span class="smcap">Glasgow magistrate</span>, who
made one of a deputation to receive his Majesty.</p>

<p><b>Glaze</b>, glass; generally applied to windows. To “star the <span class="smcap lowercase">GLAZE</span>” is to

<p><b>Glump</b>, to sulk.</p>

<p><b>Glumpish</b>, of a stubborn, sulky temper.</p>

<div><p><b>Go</b>, a <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span> of gin, a quartern of that liquor. (This word, as applied to a
measure of liquor, is stated to have arisen from the following circumstance:&mdash;Two
well-known actors once met at the bar of a tavern to
have a “wet” together. “One more glass and then we’ll <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>,” was repeated
so often on either hand, that in the end <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span> was out of the question
with both of them, and so the word passed into a saying.) <span class="smcap">Go</span>
is also synonymous with circumstance or occurrence; “a rummy <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>,”
and “a great <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>,” signify curious and remarkable occurrences; “all
the <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>,” when anything creates unusual interest, “no <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>,” no good;
“here’s a pretty <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>!” here’s a trouble; <span class="smcap lowercase">GO</span>, a term in the game of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>

<p><b>God bless the Duke Of Argyle!</b> a Scottish insinuation made
when one shrugs his shoulders, of its being caused by parasites or
cutaneous affections.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Scotch_fiddle">SCOTCH FIDDLE</a></span>, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Scotch_greys">SCOTCH GREYS</a></span>. It is said to
have been originally the thankful exclamation of the Glasgow folk, at
finding a certain row of iron posts, erected by his grace in that city to
mark the division of his property, very convenient to rub against. Some
say the posts were put up purposely for the benefit of the good folk of
Glasgow, who were at the time suffering from the “Scotch fiddle.” This
is, however, but a Southern scandal.</p>

<p><b><a id="Gods"></a>Gods</b>, the people in the upper gallery of a theatre; “up amongst the

ceiling of the theatre; termed by the French, “paradis.”</p>

<p><b>Go due north</b>, to become bankrupt, to go to Whitecross Street.&mdash;<i>Nearly
obsolete.</i></p>

<p><b>Go for the gloves</b>, to lay against a horse on the chance of its losing,
without having the wherewithal to pay if it wins. Probably from
the custom of ladies who bet <span class="smcap lowercase">GLOVES</span>, and expect, as the racing men
say, to “stand them to nothing,” <i>i.e.</i>, to be paid if they win, but not
to pay if they lose. This is a last resource of the bankrupt turfite;
and the big handicaps at the end of the year, the Cesarewitch and
Cambridgeshire, offer both temptation and opportunity to those who
can only hope to recoup themselves for their previous losses by
“<span class="smcap lowercase">GLOVING IT</span>” successfully. When, in the sporting papers it is stated
that a settling at Tattersall’s was more than usually unsatisfactory, it
may be fairly assumed that the <span class="smcap lowercase">GLOVES</span> have not been won by those
who most desired them.</p>

<p><b>Go in</b>, to enter for, to apply oneself in pursuit of. Men at the Universities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
are said to <span class="smcap lowercase">GO IN</span> for honours, aquatics, or whatever their chief
desire or employment may be. The expression is now general.</p>

<div><p><b>Go it</b>, a term of encouragement, implying, “keep it up!” Sometimes
amplified to “<span class="smcap lowercase">GO IT</span>, ye cripples;” said to have been a facetious rendering
of the last line of Virgil’s <i>Eclogues</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ite domum saturæ, venit Hesperus, <i>ite capellæ</i>;”<br /></span>

<p><b>Gold-mine</b>, any profitable investment, from a fried-fish shop to a remunerative
speculation involving millions.</p>

<p><b>Golgotha</b>, a hat, “place of a skull.” Hence the “Don’s gallery,” at
St. Mary’s, Cambridge, and that part of the theatre at Oxford where
the heads of houses sit.</p>

<p><b>Gol-mol</b>, noise, commotion.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Golopshus</b>, splendid, delicious, luscious.&mdash;<i>Norwich.</i></p>

<div><p><b><a id="Gonnof"></a>Gonnof</b>, an expert thief, a master of his craft; one of the greatest compliments
a London pickpocket can pay another is to say, “he’s a reglar
<span class="smcap lowercase">GONNOF</span>.”&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Gun">GUN</a></span>. The word <span class="smcap lowercase">GONNOF</span> is very old. During Kett’s
rebellion in Norfolk, in the reign of Edward VI., a song was sung by
the insurgents in which the term occurs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The country <span class="smcap lowercase">GNOFFES</span>, Hob, Dick, and Hick,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With slaughter’d bodies soone.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><b>Good people</b>, the name given by country folk, evidently from fear of
offending by any less decided term, to fairies, brownies, pixies, &amp;c.
Mothers often say to querulous children, “I wish the <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD PEOPLE</span>
would run away with you.”</p>

<p><b>Goods</b>, in the sporting world, men or horses. A horse or man of exceptionable
quality is called “good <span class="smcap lowercase">GOODS</span>,” and a backer will speak of
either as being in his opinion “best <span class="smcap lowercase">GOODS</span>,” as compared with others
in the race.</p>

<p><b>Good time</b>, an expressive phrase, which means all earthly bliss to the
American mind. The finest reminiscence a Yankee can have is that
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD TIME</span>, wherever it may have been spent. No moderate
amount of happiness is ever recorded in the register which denotes
how often its possessor has “had a <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD TIME</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Good woman</b>, a not uncommon public-house sign, representing a
woman without a head,&mdash;the ungallant allusion is that she cannot
scold. Maybe, the publican does not think that it means also that she
cannot drink. The Honest Lawyer, another sign, is depicted in the
same manner.</p>

<p><b>Goose</b>, a tailor’s pressing iron. Originally a slang term, but now in most
dictionaries.</p>

<p><b>Goose;</b> “Paddy’s <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOSE</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, the White Swan, a celebrated public-house
in Ratcliff Highway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Goose</b>, “to cook his <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOSE</span>,” to kill him; the same as “to give him his
gruel,” or “settle his hash.”</p>

<p><b>Goose</b>, “to get the <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOSE</span>,” “to be <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOSED</span>,” signifies to be hissed while
on the stage. The big-bird, the terror of actors. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Big-Bird">BIG BIRD</a></span>.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Goose</b>, to ruin, or spoil; to hiss a play.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i> To be “sound on
the <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOSE</span>” is in America to be orthodox in one’s political creed.</p>

<p><b><a id="Gooseberry"></a>Gooseberry</b>, to “play up old <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOSEBERRY</span>” with any one, to defeat or
silence a person in a quick or summary manner.</p>

<p><b>Gooseberry-pickers</b>, sharp children, who are ostensibly placed in
charge of their elder sisters, when the latter go out shopping, but who

<p><b>Goosecap</b>, a simpleton, a booby, or noodle.&mdash;<i>Devonshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Gooser</b>, a settler, or finishing blow.</p>

<p><b>Go over</b>, in clerical slang, signifies to join the Church of Rome.</p>

<p><b>Gorge</b>, to eat in a ravenous manner. “Rotten <span class="smcap lowercase">GORGERS</span>” are those hungry
lads who hang about Covent Garden Market, and devour the discarded
fruit.</p>

<p><b><a id="Gorger"></a>Gorger</b>, a swell, a well-dressed, or gorgeous man&mdash;probably derived from
the latter adjective. Sometimes used to denote an employer, or principal,
as the manager of a theatre.</p>

<p><b>Gormed</b>, a Norfolk corruption of a profane oath. So used by Mr. Peggotty
in <i>David Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p><b>Gospel grinder</b>, a City missionary, or tract-distributor.</p>

<p><b>Gospel Shop</b>, an irreverent term for a church or chapel of any denomination.
Mostly in use among sailors.</p>

<p><b>Goss</b>, a hat&mdash;from the gossamer silk of which modern hats are made.</p>

<p><b>Goss</b>, “to give a man <span class="smcap lowercase">GOSS</span>,” to requite an injury, to beat, or kill.
This is an Americanism, and is applied variously. A steamboat captain
on the Mississippi, determined to pass his rival, called out, so the
story goes, to the fireman, “Give her <span class="smcap lowercase">GOSS</span> and let her rip, as I mean
to pass that boat, or bust.”</p>

<p><b>Goth</b>, an uncultivated person. One who is ignorant of the ways of
society.</p>

<p><b>Go the whole pile</b>, to put all one’s bank on a solitary chance. An
Americanism which had its origin in the <span class="smcap lowercase">PILES</span> of gold dust used as circulating
medium by gambling miners.</p>

<p><b>Gourock ham</b>, a salt herring. <span class="smcap">Gourock</span>, on the Clyde, about twenty-five
miles from Glasgow, was formerly a great fishing village.&mdash;<i>Scotch.</i></p>

<p><b>Grab</b>, to clutch, or seize; <span class="smcap lowercase">GRABBED</span>, caught, apprehended.</p>

<p><b>Grace-card</b>, the six of hearts, so termed in Ireland. A Kilkenny gentleman,
named <span class="smcap lowercase">GRACE</span>, being solicited, with promises of royal favour,
to espouse the cause of William III., gave the following answer, written
on the back of the six of hearts, to an emissary of Marshal Schomberg’s,
who had been commissioned to make the proposal to him:&mdash;“Tell
your master I despise his offer; and that honour and conscience
are dearer to a gentleman than all the wealth and titles a prince can
bestow.” This would have been a much better story had James II.
been a better King, and had he not earned for himself, even among
Catholic Irishmen, a disgraceful name, through his craven conduct at
the Battle of the Boyne.</p>

<p><b>Graft</b>, work; “where are you <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAFTING</span>?” <i>i.e.</i>, where do you work?
“What <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAFT</span> are you at?” what are you doing? Perhaps derived
from gardening phraseology; or a variation of <i>craft</i>.</p>

<p><b>Granny</b>, a knot which will not hold, from its being wrongly and clumsily
tied.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Granny</b>, to know, or recognise; “do ye <span class="smcap lowercase">GRANNY</span> the bloke?” do you
know the man?</p>

<p><b>Grappling irons</b>, fingers.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Grass</b>, “gone to <span class="smcap lowercase">GRASS</span>,” dead,&mdash;a coarse allusion to burial; absconded,
or disappeared suddenly; also, gone to waste; it is said of wasted
limbs that they have “gone to <span class="smcap lowercase">GRASS</span>;” “oh, go to <span class="smcap lowercase">GRASS</span>,” a common
answer to a troublesome or inquisitive person,&mdash;possibly a corruption
of “go to <span class="smcap lowercase">GRACE</span>,” meaning, of course, a directly opposite fate.</p>

<p><b>Grass</b>, to knock down. Also to throw in a wrestling-match. “He
<span class="smcap lowercase">GRASSED</span> his man with a heavy righthander,” or “He brought his man
to <span class="smcap lowercase">GRASS</span> by means of a swinging hipe.”</p>

<p><b>Grass-comber</b>, a country fellow, a haymaker.</p>

<p><b>Grasshopper</b>, a waiter at a tea-garden.</p>

<p><b>Grass widow</b>, an unmarried mother; a deserted mistress. In the
United States, during the gold fever in California, it was common for
an adventurer to put both his wife (termed in his absence a <span class="smcap lowercase">GRASS-WIDOW</span>)
and his children to school during his absence. Also a married
woman, resident in England, whose husband is in India or the
colonies.</p>

<p><b>Gravel</b>, to confound, to bother; “I’m <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAVELLED</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, perplexed or

<p><b>Gravesend sweetmeats</b>, shrimps. <span class="smcap">Gravesend twins</span> are solid
particles of sewage.</p>

<p><b>Gray</b>, a halfpenny, with either two “heads” or two “tails”&mdash;both sides
alike. They are used for cheating the unwary at “Tommy Dodd,” or
pitch and toss. They are often “rung in” with a victim’s own money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>,
so that the caller of “heads” or “tails” cannot lose. Thus if A
has to call, he or a confederate manages to mix the selected <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAYS</span>
with B’s tossing halfpence. There are various and almost obvious
uses for them.</p>

<p><b>Gray-coat parson</b>, a lay impropriator, or lessee of great tithes.</p>

<p><b>Gray mare</b>, a wife who “wears the breeches.” From an old story in
which the point is to show that the “<span class="smcap lowercase">GRAY MARE</span>,” the wife’s choice,
“is the better horse,” and by parity of reasoning that the wife is
superior to the husband.</p>

<p><b>Grays</b>, or <span class="smcap">Scotch grays</span>, lice. These pretty little things are called by
many names, among others by those of <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAY-BACKS</span>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">GOLD-BACKED
UNS</span>, which are popular among those who have most interest
in the matter.</p>

<p><b>Grease spot</b>, a minute remnant, humorously the only distinguishable

Term used in making promises never intended to be carried out. The

<p><b><a id="St_Giles_Greeks"></a>Greeks</b>, the low Irish. St. Giles’s <span class="smcap">Greek</span>, slang or cant language.
Cotgrave gives merrie <span class="smcap">Greek</span> as a definition for a roystering fellow,
a drunkard. The <span class="smcap">Greeks</span> have always been regarded as a jolly,
luxurious race; so much so, that the Latins employed the verb
<i>Græcari</i> (lit. to play the <span class="smcap">Greek</span>) to designate fine living and free
potations, a sense in which Horace frequently uses it; while Shakspeare
often mentions the merry <span class="smcap">Greeks</span>; and “as merry as a grig”
(or <span class="smcap">Greek</span>) was long a favourite allusion in old English authors. It is
said by some that grig is in this sense intended to represent the small
eel of that name which from its lively movements is supposed to be
always merry; while others incline to the belief that the cricket,
which is also in some parts of the provinces known as a grig, is
meant. Readers may take their choice.</p>

<p><b>Green</b>, ignorant, not wide-awake, inexperienced.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i> “Do you
see any <span class="smcap lowercase">GREEN</span> in my eye?” ironical question in a dispute.</p>

<p><b>Greenbacks</b>, the paper money issued in the United States during the
war. The term was at first applied only to the notes for small

represented all descriptions of what is now known in America as
“currency.”</p>

<p><b>Green-horn</b>, a fresh, simple, or uninitiated person.</p>

<p><b>Greenlander</b>, an inexperienced person, a spoon. Sometimes an Irishman.</p>

words.&mdash;<i>Seven Dials.</i></p>

<p><b>Gridiron</b>, a County Court summons. Originally a summons to the
Court of Westminster only; from the <span class="smcap lowercase">GRIDIRON</span> arms. The
Grafton Club is nearly always known as the <span class="smcap lowercase">GRID</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">GRIDIRON</span>, that
instrument being brought into requisition whenever possible in the
cuisine.</p>

<p><b>Gridiron and dough boys</b>, the flag of the United States, in allusion
to the stars and stripes.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Grief</b>, “to come to <span class="smcap lowercase">GRIEF</span>,” to meet with an accident, to be ruined.</p>

<p><b>Grist to the mill</b>, money to the pocket, food to the family; anything

<p><b>Grizzle</b>, to fret or cry continuously.</p>

such a person it is often said, “He bears his blushing honours thick
upon him.”</p>

<p><b>Grog-fight</b>, a drinking party.&mdash;<i>Military.</i></p>

<p><b>Groggy</b>, tipsy; when a prize-fighter becomes “weak on his pins,” and
nearly beaten, he is said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">GROGGY</span>. The same term is applied
to horses that are overworked and unsteady. From similarity of
appearance to the peculiarity of gait consequent on imbibing too much
<span class="smcap lowercase">GROG</span>.</p>

<p><b>Grove of the Evangelist</b>, a facetious name for St. John’s Wood.</p>

<p><b><a id="Growler"></a>Growler</b>, a four-wheeled cab. It is generally supposed that drivers of

<p><b>Grubby</b>, musty, or old-fashioned.&mdash;<i>Devonshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Gruel</b>, “to give a person his <span class="smcap lowercase">GRUEL</span>,” to kill him. An expression in all
probability derived from the report of a trial for poisoning, or from
the easiest manner of administering a dose of poison. In the old days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
a similar phrase was “to drug a posset.” Compare “<a href="#Hash">to settle his
hash</a>,” and “<a href="#Cook_ones_goose">cook his goose</a>.”</p>

<p><b>Guardevine</b>, a cellaret.&mdash;<i>Scotch.</i></p>

<p><b>Guinea to a goose</b>, a sporting phrase, meaning long odds in favour of,
or against, anything under notice. In the City this state of things
is represented by the phrase, Lombard Street to a China orange. There
are also other colloquialisms on this subject, but their power is, as a rule,
mainly dependent upon their indecency.</p>

<p><b><a id="Gulfed"></a>Gulfed</b>, originally a Cambridge term, denoting that a man is unable to
enter for the classical examination from having failed in the mathematical.
These men’s names appeared in the list of “Degrees
Allowed.” The name <span class="smcap lowercase">GULF</span> for this list is said to have arisen
from the boast of a former “wooden spoon.” “I would have you to
know there is a great <span class="smcap lowercase">GULF</span> between <i>me</i> and the captain of the poll.”
Candidates for classical honours were compelled to go in for both
examinations. From the alteration of the arrangements, the term as
thus applied is now obsolete. The expression is common now in
Oxford as descriptive of a man who goes in for honours, and only gets
a pass. An Honorary Fourth is when a candidate who only tries for
a pass does so well that he is raised to the honours’ list.</p>

<p><b>Gull</b>, to cheat, to deceive; also one easily cheated. From the easy
manner in which the bird of that name is deceived.</p>

<span class="smcap lowercase">GUN’S</span> practice is known as <span class="smcap lowercase">GUNOVING</span>.</p>

<p><b>Gunner’s daughter</b>, a term facetiously applied to the method of
punishing boys in the Royal Navy by tying them securely to the
breech of a cannon, so as to present the proper part convenient for the
cat, and flogging them. This is called “marrying” or “kissing” the
<span class="smcap lowercase">GUNNER’S DAUGHTER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Gup</b>, gossip.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Gurrawaun</b>, a coachman, a native Indian corruption of the English
word coachman. For another curious corruption of a similar kind,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Gusher</b>, one overflowing with sentiment, a rhapsodizer. Romance-reading
young ladies are generally described as <span class="smcap lowercase">GUSHING</span>, and of late
years the word <span class="smcap lowercase">GUSH</span> has done duty as representing the newspaper
work necessary for a continuance of the “largest circulation.”</p>

<p><b>Gut scraper</b>, a fiddler.</p>

<p><b>Gutter blood</b>, a low or vulgar man.&mdash;<i>Scotch.</i></p>

<p><b>Gutter lane</b>, the throat. Probably from <span class="smcap lowercase">GUTTUR</span>.</p>

Guy Fawkes carried about by boys on Nov. 5. “Hollo, boys, another
<span class="smcap lowercase">GUY</span>!”</p>

<p><b>Guy</b>, to get away. Same as <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Hedge">HEDGE</a></span> in street phraseology, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Guzzle"></a>Guzzle</b>, to eat or drink to excess; to eat loudly, hastily, and clumsily.</p>

<p><b>Hair of the dog</b>, a “modest quencher,” taken the morning following
a debauch. Originally a “<span class="smcap lowercase">HAIR OF THE DOG</span> that bit you.” This is

<p><b>Half-a-bean</b>, half-a-sovereign.</p>

<p><b>Half-a-bull</b>, two shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p><b><a id="Half-rocked"></a>Half-rocked</b>, silly, half-witted. Derived from a vulgar idea that in the

affects their wits. They are said to be nursed bottom upwards, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
as to sleep without much rocking. If this is inconsequent it is the
fault of the saying and not of the dictionary. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Half-baked">HALF-BAKED</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Half-seas-over</b>, reeling drunk.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i> Used by Swift.</p>

and speed, so as to place them as much as possible on an equality.
At other sports this equalization is managed by means of starts.</p>

<p>The old game of <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAP</span> (hand i’ the cap) is a very different
affair; and, as it is now almost obsolete, being only played by gentlemen
in Ireland, after hunting and racing dinners, when the wine
has circulated pretty freely, merits a description here. It is played
by three persons, in the following manner:&mdash;A wishes to obtain some
article belonging to B, say a horse; and offers to “challenge” his
watch against it. B agrees; and C is chosen as <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPER</span> to
“make the award”&mdash;that is, to name the sum of money that the owner
of the article of lesser value shall give with it, in exchange for the
more valuable one. The three parties, A, B, and C, put down a
certain stake each, and then the <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPER</span> makes his award. If
A and B are both satisfied with the award, the exchange is made between
the horse and watch, and the <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPER</span> wins, and takes up
the stakes. Or if neither be satisfied with the award, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPER</span>
takes the stakes; but if A be satisfied and B not, or <i>vice versâ</i>,
the party who declares himself satisfied gets the stakes. It is consequently
the object of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPER</span> to make such award as will
cause the challenger and challenged to be of the same mind; and considerable
ingenuity is required and exhibited on his part. The challenge
having been made, as stated, between A’s watch and B’s horse,
each party puts his <span class="smcap lowercase">HAND</span> into a <span class="smcap lowercase">CAP</span> or hat [or into his pocket] while C
makes the award, which he purposely does in as rapid and complex a
manner as possible. Thus, after humorously exaggerating the various
excellences of the articles, he may say&mdash;“The owner of the superior
gold lever watch shall give to the owner of the beautiful thoroughbred
bay horse, called Flyaway, the watch and fifteen half-crowns, seven
crowns, eighteen half-guineas, one hundred and forty groats, thirteen
sovereigns, fifty-nine pence, seventeen shillings and sixty-three farthings.
Draw, gentlemen!” A and B must instantly then draw out
and open their hands. If money appears in both, they are agreed, and
the award stands good; if money be in neither hand, they are also
agreed, but the award is rejected. If money be only in one hand, they
are not agreed, the award is off, and the stakes go as already stated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Very frequently, neither A nor B is sufficiently quick in his mental calculation
to follow the <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPER</span>, and not knowing on the instant
the total of the various sums in the award, prefers being “off,” and,
therefore, “draws” no money. As in this event the <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPER</span>
gets the stakes, the reason for the complex nature of his award is
obvious.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPING</span> has once commenced in a convivial party, it
is considered unsportsmanlike to refuse a challenge. So when the
small hours draw on, and the fun becomes fast and furious, coats,
boots, waistcoats, even shirts are challenged, <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPPED</span>, and
exchanged, amidst an almost indescribable scene of good humoured
joviality and stentorian laughter. This is the true <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAP</span>. The
application of the term to horse-racing has arisen from one or more
persons being chosen to make the award between persons, who put
down equal sums of money, on entering horses unequal in power and
speed for the same race. So that the <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAP</span> has ultimately come
to be regarded as an arrangement of a purely business-like nature, by
which means affairs, no matter how much they may differ in degree,
may be arranged satisfactorily by all parties. The use of the word
is spreading rapidly, and it has already a sense beyond that of mere
sporting.</p>

<p><b>Handicap</b>, to make even, as a Roland for an Oliver. Not long since in
a pedestrian enclosure, a pugilist who had been specially retained on
one side struck a member of the other party, who not being a fighting-man
received the blow with apparent contentment. The injured person
had, however, determined on being revenged, and about an hour afterwards
he knocked the professional down with a big stick, using the
words at the same time, “that <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAPS</span> us” (that makes us even).
The word is often used thus also: A man finding himself inferior to
another at fisticuffs will, seizing a weapon, exclaim, “I’ll <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAP</span>
you,” <i>i.e.</i>, I’ll bring you to my level (or “level myself up”) with this.</p>

<p><b>Handseller</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEAP JACK</span>, a street or open-air seller, a man who
carries goods to his customers, instead of waiting for his customers to
visit him.</p>

<p><b><a id="Hanging"></a>Hanging</b>, in difficulties. A man who is in great straits, and who
is, therefore, prepared to do anything desperate to retrieve his fortunes,
is said, among sporting men, to be “a man <span class="smcap lowercase">HANGING</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, a man to
whom any change must be for the better.</p>

<p><b>Heavy wet</b>, malt liquor&mdash;because the more a man drinks of it, the

<p><b><a id="Hedge"></a>Hedge</b>, to get away from any dangerous spot. “We saw the slop
coming, and <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGED</span> at once.”</p>

<div><p><b>Hedge</b>, to secure oneself from loss over one bet by making others.
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGING</span>, as a system of betting, is entirely dependent upon what
happens in the market after a horse has been backed. From information,
or good judgment, a backer selects, say, three horses, A, B, and
C, whom he thinks likely to advance in the betting, and takes 50 to 1&mdash;say
£1000 to £20&mdash;against each of them. As the race-day
approaches the horse A may fall out of the betting, from accident or
other cause, and have to be written off as a dead loss of £20. But
the other two horses, as anticipated, improve in public favour, and the
backer, who now becomes a <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGER</span>, succeeds in laying 5 to 1&mdash;say
£500 to £100&mdash;against B, and 2 to 1&mdash;say 500 to £250&mdash;against C.
The account then stands thus:&mdash;A is a certain loss of £20; but if B
wins, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGER</span> will receive £1000 and pay £500; balance in
favour, £500. If B loses, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGER</span> will receive £100 and pay £20;
balance in favour, £80. If C wins, the hedger will receive £1000
and pay £500; balance in favour, £500. If C loses, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGER</span> will
receive £250 and pay £20; balance in favour, £230. Deducting,
then, the loss of £20 on A, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGER’S</span> winnings will be considerable;
and he cannot lose, providing his information or judgment lead
to the required result. It must be borne in mind that very often a
man who feels inclined to go in for a <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGING</span> speculation, may back
half a dozen horses, not one of which sees a short price or goes to the
post; besides which it must never be forgotten, that, however well turf
speculations may look on paper, they are subject to the contingency
of the bets being honourably paid on settling-day&mdash;the Monday after a
race&mdash;when unfortunately there are often more “receivers” than
“payers” at the clubs. However, turf transactions are among professionals
conducted at least as honourably as are any other business
matters; and it is only the fledgling swell, to whom the Legislature
gives special opportunities of losing his money, who is generally
<i>non est</i> when paytime comes. “The Druid” in <i>Post and Paddock</i> has
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The term <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGING</span> has been quite superseded by “laying off;” and we had, in
fact, quite forgotten it till we saw it stated in the papers lately, by a clergyman,
who did not answer a question on doctrine as the Bishop of Exeter exactly
liked, that his lordship addressed him to this effect: ‘You are <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGING</span>, sir;
you are <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGING</span>!’”</p></div>

<p>Usually correct as “The Druid” was, he seems to have fallen into an
error here, as <span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGING</span>, and “laying off,” have been exchangeable
terms, as far as the oldest turfite can say. It should be remembered that
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEDGING</span> is generally done with the man who has originally laid the
odds; for as a natural consequence, when the backer finds it convenient
to hedge, the layer finds it equally so to back the horse back,&mdash;the first
loss being considered always the best by bookmakers who <i>are</i> bookmakers.
Besides which, the layer has generally a lot of “dead
money”&mdash;money to the good over horses he has laid against, which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
since been struck out&mdash;and this he profitably expends in backing certain
horses back for the purpose of levelling up the book.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Hedge-popping</b>, shooting small birds about the hedges, as boys do;
unsportsmanlike kind of shooting.</p>

<p><b>Heel-tap</b>, the small quantity of wine or other beverage left in the
bottom of a glass, considered as a sign that the liquor is not liked, and
therefore unfriendly and unsocial to the host and the company. <i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Daylights">DAY-LIGHT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Heigh-ho!</b> a cant term for stolen yarn, from the expression used to

“silver hells.” Reason obvious.</p>

<p><b>Hempen cravat</b>, the hangman’s noose.</p>

<p><b>Herring-pond</b>, the sea; “to be sent across the <span class="smcap lowercase">HERRING-POND</span>,” to
be transported.</p>

<p><b>Hiding</b>, a thrashing. Webster gives this word, but not its root, <span class="smcap lowercase">HIDE</span>,
to beat, to flay by whipping. Most likely from the part attacked. The
threat of thrashing is sometimes conveyed thus:&mdash;“I’ll tan (or dress)
your <span class="smcap lowercase">HIDE</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Higgledy-piggledy</b>, confusedly, all together,&mdash;as pigs lie.</p>

<div><p><b><a id="High_and_dry"></a>High and dry</b>, an epithet applied to the <i>soi-disant</i> “orthodox” clergy

<p>Though often confounded with, they are utterly dissimilar to, the
modern High Church or Anglo-Catholic party, who now receive the

<p><b>High Church</b>, term used in contradistinction from “Low Church.”</p>

high-sounding, unmeaning eloquence, bombast.</p>

<p><b>High-flier</b>, anything above the common order. Apt students, fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
coaches, and special trains are sufficient instances of the extreme openness
of the qualification.</p>

<p><b>High-fly</b>, “<span class="smcap lowercase">ON THE HIGH-FLY</span>,” on the genteel or letter-bearing
begging system.</p>

<p><b>High-flyer</b>, a genteel beggar or swindler. A begging-letter impostor.</p>

<p><b>High-flyer</b>, a large swing, in frames, at fairs and races. The first fast
coaches were called high-flyers on account of their desperate speed.</p>

<p><b>High jinks</b>, “<span class="smcap lowercase">ON THE HIGH JINKS</span>,” taking up an arrogant position,
assuming an undue superiority. Scott explains this game in <i>Guy
Mannering</i>. Nowadays <span class="smcap lowercase">HIGH JINKS</span> is often used to mean a jollification.</p>

<p><b>High-lows</b>, laced boots reaching a trifle higher than ankle-jacks.</p>

<p><b>High-strikes</b>, corruption of <i>Hysterics</i>.</p>

<p><b>Hipped</b>, bored, offended, crossed, low-spirited, &amp;c. This may have
been originally hypped, and have had some connexion with hypochondriacal
affections.</p>

<p><b>Hitched</b>, an Americanism for married. From the word <span class="smcap lowercase">HITCH</span>, used in
America in the sense of to harness.</p>

<p><b>Hittite</b>, a facetious sporting term for a prize-fighter. Derived from the
Bible.</p>

<p><b>Hivite</b>, a student of St. Begh’s College, Cumberland, which is pronounced
and generally written St. Bee’s. Literally, Hive-ite.</p>

<p><b>Hoax</b>, to deceive, or ridicule,&mdash;Grose says this was originally a University
cant word. Corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Hocus">HOCUS</a></span>, to cheat.</p>

<p><b>Hob and nob</b>, to act in concert with another; to lay “heads together;”
to touch glasses in drinking; to fraternize in a convivial meeting or
merry-making. Originally meaning “foot and head,”&mdash;the touching
of the top of one glass with the bottom of another, and then reversing
the order. Nowadays it means simply to clink glasses together as a
salutation before imbibing.</p>

<p><b>Hobbadehoy</b>, a youth who has ceased to regard himself as a boy, and
is not yet regarded as a man.</p>

<p><b>Hobble</b>, trouble of any kind. A man is said to be in a <span class="smcap lowercase">HOBBLE</span> when
he has offended the proprieties in any way, “from pitch and toss to
manslaughter.”</p>

<p><b>Hobbled</b>, committed for trial; properly said of animals fed by the wayside,
with their forelegs fastened together. Hence people who gather
burdens about them are said to get into <span class="smcap lowercase">HOBBLES</span>.</p>

<p><b>Hob Collingwood</b>, according to Brockett, a north country term for
the four of hearts, considered an unlucky card.</p>

<p><b>Hobson’s choice</b>, “this or none.” Hobson was a carrier at Cambridge,
and also a letter-out of horses for hire; and is said to have
always compelled his customers to take the horse that stood in the
stall next the stable-door or none at all. He was a benefactor to
the town, and Hobson’s Conduit still stands as a memorial of him.</p>

<p><b>Hock-dockies</b>, shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

ankles. Term originating with horsey men.</p>

<p><b><a id="Hocus"></a>Hocus</b>, to drug a person for purposes of robbery. The potion generally
consists of snuff and beer among rogues of the lowest class, and is by
them called “snuffing a bloke;” or sometimes, when the drug is
administered to a woman for purposes other than those of robbery,
“snuffing a blowen.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Hocus_pocus"></a>Hocus pocus</b>, gipsy words of magic, similar to the modern “presto
fly.” The gipsies pronounce “<i>Habeas Corpus</i>,” <span class="smcap lowercase">HAWCUS PACCUS</span> (<i>see</i>
Crabb’s <i>Gipsies’ Advocate</i>, p. 18); can this have anything to do with the
origin of <span class="smcap lowercase">HOCUS POCUS</span>? Turner gives <span class="smcap lowercase">OCHUS BOCHUS</span>, an old demon.
Pegge, however, states that it is a burlesque rendering of the words of
the Roman Catholic Church service at the delivery of the host, <span class="smcap lowercase">HOC
EST CORPUS</span>, which the early Protestants considered as a species of
conjuring, and ridiculed accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Hodge</b>, a countryman or provincial clown. Most country districts in
England have one or more families in the name of <span class="smcap lowercase">HODGE</span>; indeed,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GILES</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">HODGE</span> appear to be the favourite hobnail nomenclature.
<span class="smcap">Hodge</span> is said to be simply an abbreviation of Roger.</p>

<p><b>Hog</b>, a shilling.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Hog</b>, “to go the whole <span class="smcap lowercase">HOG</span>;” “the whole <span class="smcap lowercase">HOG</span> or none,” to do anything
with a person’s entire strength, not “by halves;” realized by the
phrase “in for a penny in for a pound.” Bartlett claims this to be a
pure American phrase; whilst Ker, of course, gives it a Dutch origin.&mdash;<i>Old.</i>
“To go the whole <span class="smcap lowercase">HOG</span>” is frequently altered by those people
who believe there is wit in circumlocution, into “the entire animal,”
or “the complete swine!”</p>

<p><b>Hoga</b>, do. “That wont <span class="smcap lowercase">HOGA</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, that wont do, is one of the very
commonest of the Anglo-Indian slang phrases.</p>

<p><b>Holy Land</b>, a very old term for the Seven Dials,&mdash;where St. Giles’s
Greek is spoken.</p>

<p><b>Homo</b>, a man. <i>Lingua Franca</i>; but <i>see</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Omee">OMEE</a></span>, the more usual Cockney
pronunciation.</p>

<p><b>Hondey</b>, a Manchester name for an omnibus, and the abbreviation of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HONDEYBUSH</span>, the original Lancashire pronunciation of the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Honest Shilling</b>, a shilling earned by a process actually immoral, but
not positively illegal. The money earned by a prostitute is said to be
honest, as distinguished from that obtained by a thief. Probably from
the story of the converted burglar, who determined to sin no more
himself, and who lectured against dishonesty, but sent his wife out
regularly every evening with instructions to earn an <span class="smcap lowercase">HONEST SHILLING</span>.</p>

<p><b>Honey blobs</b>, a Scotch term for large ripe, yellow gooseberries.</p>

<p><b>Honour bright</b>, an asseveration which means literally, “by my honour,
which is bright and unsullied.” It is often still further curtailed to
“<span class="smcap lowercase">HONOUR</span>!” only.</p>

<p><b>Hook</b>, an expression at Oxford, implying doubt, either connected with
<a href="#Hookey_walker">Hookey Walker</a>, or with a note of interrogation (?) “Yes, with a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK</span> at the end of it!” <i>i.e.</i>, with some reservation, generally that of
doubt, by the speaker.</p>

<p><b>Hook</b>, to steal or rob. <i>See</i> the following.</p>

<p><b>Hook or by crook</b>, by fair means or foul&mdash;in allusion to the hook
with which footpads used to steal from open windows, &amp;c., and from
which <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK</span>, to take or steal, has been derived. Mentioned in <i>Hudibras</i>
as a cant term.</p>

<p><b><a id="Hook"></a>Hook it</b>, “get out of the way,” or “be off about your business;”
generally varied by “take your <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK</span>.” “To <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK</span> it,” to run away,
to decamp; “on one’s own <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK</span>,” dependent upon one’s own
exertions. Originally connected with the preceding, but now
perfectly “on its own <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK</span>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Hookey_walker"></a>Hookey walker!</b> ejaculation of incredulity, usually shortened to
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Walker">WALKER</a></span>!&mdash;which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Hooks</b>, “dropped off the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOKS</span>,” said of a deceased person&mdash;possibly
derived from the ancient practice of suspending on hooks the quarters
of a traitor or felon sentenced by the old law to be hung, drawn, and
quartered, which dropped off the hooks as they decayed.</p>

<p><b>Hook um snivey</b> (formerly “<span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">SNIVEY</span>”), a low expression,
meaning to cheat by feigning sickness or other means. Also a piece
of thick iron wire crooked at one end, and fastened into a wooden
handle, for the purpose of undoing from the outside the wooden bolt
of a door. Sometimes used as an irrelevant answer by street boys. As,
“who did that?”&mdash;“<span class="smcap lowercase">HOOK UM SNIVEY</span>”&mdash;actually no one.</p>

<p><b>Hop</b>, a dance.&mdash;<i>Fashionable slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Hop merchant</b>, a dancing master.</p>

<p><b>Hop o’ my thumb</b>, an undersized person. From the story of that
name. Portion of a set of phrases established for the benefit of the
small, in which Tomtit, Little Breeches, Daniel Lambert, Sixfoot,
Twentystun, &amp;c., play a prominent part.</p>

<p><b>Hopping Giles</b>, a cripple. St. Ægidius or Giles, himself similarly
afflicted, was the patron saint of lazars and cripples. The ancient lazar
houses were dedicated to him.</p>

<p><b>Hoppo</b>, custom-house officer, or custom-house. Almost anything connected
with custom-house business.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="Hop_the_twig"></a>Hop the twig</b>, to run away; also, a flippant expression meaning to die.
Many similar phrases are used by the thoughtless and jocose, as
“laying down one’s knife and fork,” “pegging out,” from the game
of cribbage, and “snuffing it.” A new form of this phraseology is to
say that a man has “given up” or “given in.”</p>

<p><b>Hornswoggle</b>, nonsense, humbug. Believed to be of American origin.</p>

<p><b>Horrors</b>, the low spirits, or “blue devils,” which follow intoxication.
Incipient <i>del. trem.</i></p>

five-pound note.</p>

<p><b>Horse</b>, to flog. From the old wooden horse or flogging-stool.</p>

<p><b>Horsebreaker.</b> <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Pretty_horsebreakers">PRETTY HORSEBREAKER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Horse_chaunter"></a>Horse chaunter</b>, a dealer who takes worthless horses to country
fairs and disposes of them by artifice. He is generally an unprincipled
fellow, and will put in a glass eye, fill a beast with shot, plug him with
ginger, or in fact do anything so that he sells to advantage. <i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Coper">COPER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Horse_marine"></a>Horse marine</b>, an awkward person. In ancient times the “jollies,” or
Royal Marines, were the butts of the sailors, from their ignorance of
seamanship. “Tell that to the <span class="smcap lowercase">MARINES</span>, the blue jackets wont
believe it!” was a common rejoinder to a “stiff yarn.” A <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE
marine</span> (an impossibility) was used to denote one more awkward even
than an ordinary “jolly.” Nowadays the <span class="smcap lowercase">MARINES</span> are deservedly
appreciated as one of the finest regiments in the service.</p>

<p><b><a id="Horse_nails"></a>Horse nails.</b> At the game of cribbage, when a player finds it his
policy to keep his antagonist back, rather than push himself forward,
and plays accordingly, he is sometimes said “to feed his opponent on
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE NAILS</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Horse nails</b>, money.&mdash;<i>Compare</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Brads">BRADS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Hot coppers</b>, the feverish sensations experienced in the morning by
those who have been drunk over-night.</p>

<p><b>Hot tiger</b>, an Oxford mixture of hot-spiced ale and sherry.</p>

<p><b>House of Commons</b>, a humorous term for the closet of decency.</p>

<p><b>Houses;</b> “safe as <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUSES</span>,” an expression to satisfy a doubting person;
“Oh! it’s as safe as <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUSES</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, perfectly safe, apparently in allusion
to the paying character of house property as an investment. It is said
the phrase originated when the railway bubbles began to burst, and
when people began to turn their attention to the more ancient forms
of speculation, which though slow were sure.</p>

<p><b>Housewarming</b>, the first friendly gathering in a new or freshly-occupied
house.</p>

<p><b>How-came-you-so?</b> intoxicated.</p>

<p><b>How much?</b> A facetious way of asking for an explanation of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
difficult or pedantic expression. “Why don’t you cook your potatoes
in an anhydrohepsaterion?” A waggish listener might be excused for
asking, “An anhydro&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">HOW MUCH</span>!”</p>

<p><b>How’s your poor feet?</b> an idiotic street cry with no meaning, much
in vogue a few years back.</p>

<p><b><a id="Hoxter"></a>Hoxter</b>, an inside pocket.&mdash;<i>Old English</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">OXTER</span>. Probably the low
slang word <span class="smcap lowercase">HUXTER</span>, money, is derived from this. <span class="smcap">Oxter</span> is, among
the Irish, an armpit.</p>

<p><b>Hubble bubble</b>, the Indian pipe termed a hookah is thus designated,
from the noise it makes when being smoked.</p>

<p><b>Huey</b>, a town or village.&mdash;<i>Tramps’ term.</i></p>

<p><b>Huff</b>, a dodge or trick; “don’t try that <span class="smcap lowercase">HUFF</span> on me,” or “that <span class="smcap lowercase">HUFF</span>
wont do.” Also a term in the game of draughts,&mdash;the penalty for
failing to take an opponent’s piece when an opportunity occurs.</p>

<p><b>Huff</b>, to vex, to offend; a poor temper. <span class="smcap">Huffy</span>, easily offended.
<span class="smcap">Huffed</span>, annoyed, offended. Some folk are tersely and truly described
as easily <span class="smcap lowercase">HUFFED</span>.</p>

<p><b>Hugger-mugger</b>, underhand, sneaking. Also, “in a state of <span class="smcap lowercase">HUGGER-MUGGER</span>”
means to be muddled.</p>

<p><b><a id="Hulk"></a>Hulk</b>, to hang about in hopes of an invitation. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Mooch">MOOCH</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Hulky</b>, extra-sized.&mdash;<i>Shropshire.</i> From this and from hulk we probably
get our adjective <span class="smcap lowercase">HULKING</span>, as applied to the great lazy ruffians who
infest low neighbourhoods.</p>

<p><b>Hum and haw</b>, to hesitate, or raise objections.&mdash;<i>Old English.</i></p>

<p><b>Humble pie</b>, to “eat <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBLE PIE</span>,” to knock under, to be submissive.
The <span class="smcap lowercase">UMBLES</span>, or entrails, and other unprime parts of a deer, were
anciently made into a dish for servants, while their masters feasted off
the haunch.</p>

<p><b>Hum-box</b>, a pulpit. This is a very old term.</p>

<div><p><b>Humbug</b>, an imposition, or a person who imposes upon others. A
very expressive but slang word, synonymous at one time with <span class="smcap lowercase">HUM
AND HAW</span>. Lexicographers for a long time objected to the adoption
of this term. Richardson uses it frequently to express the meaning of
other words, but, strange to say, omits it in the alphabetical arrangement
as unworthy of recognition! In the first edition of this work,
1785 was given as the earliest date at which the word could be found in
a printed book. Since then <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span> has been traced half a century
further back, on the title-page of a singular old jest-book&mdash;“<i>The
Universal Jester</i>; or a pocket companion for the Wits: being a choice
collection of merry conceits, facetious drolleries, &amp;c., clenchers,
closers, closures, bon-mots, and <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUGS</span>,” by Ferdinando Killigrew.
London, about 1735-40.</p>

<p>The notorious Orator Henley was known to the mob as <span class="smcap lowercase">ORATOR
HUMBUG</span>. The fact may be learned from an illustration in that exceedingly
curious little collection of <i>Caricatures</i>, published in 1757, many
of which were sketched by Lord Bolingbroke&mdash;Horace Walpole filling
in the names and explanations. Halliwell describes <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span> as “a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
person who hums,” and cites Dean Milles’s MS., which was written about
1760. In the last century, the game now known as double-dummy was
termed <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span>. Lookup, a notorious gambler, was struck down by
apoplexy when playing at this game. On the circumstance being
reported to Foote, the wit said&mdash;“Ah, I always thought he would be
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUGGED</span> out of the world at last!” It has been stated that the
word is a corruption of Hamburgh, from which town so many false bulletins
and reports came during the war in the last century. “Oh, that
is <i>Hamburgh</i> [or <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span>],” was the answer to any fresh piece of news
which smacked of improbability. Grose mentions it in his Dictionary,
1785; and in a little printed squib, published in 1808, entitled <i>Bath
Characters</i>, by T. Goosequill, <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span> is thus mentioned in a comical
couplet on the title-page:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Wee Thre Bath Deities bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Humbug</span>, Follie, and Varietee.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gradually from this time the word began to assume a place in periodical
literature, and in novels written by not over-precise authors. In
the preface to a flat, and most likely unprofitable poem, entitled, <i>The
Reign of <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span>, a Satire</i>, 8vo, 1836, the author thus apologizes for
the use of the word:&mdash;“I have used the term <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span> to designate
this principle [wretched sophistry of life generally], considering that,
it is now adopted into our language as much as the words dunce,
jockey, cheat, swindler, &amp;c., which were formerly only colloquial
terms.” A correspondent, who in a number of <i>Adversaria</i> ingeniously
traced bombast to the inflated Doctor Paracelsus Bombast, considers
that <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span> may, in like manner, be derived from Homberg, the distinguished
chemist of the court of the Duke of Orleans, who, according
to the following passage from Bishop Berkeley’s <i>Siris</i>, was an ardent
and successful seeker after the philosopher’s stone!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“§194.&mdash;Of this there cannot be a better proof than the experiment of Monsieur
Homberg, who made gold of mercury by introducing light into its
pores, but at such trouble and expense that, I suppose, nobody will try the
experiment for profit. By this injunction of light and mercury, both bodies
became fixed, and produced a third different to either, to wit, real gold. For
the truth of which fact I refer to the memoirs of the French Academy of
Sciences.”&mdash;<i>Berkeley’s Works</i>, vol ii. p. 366 (Wright’s edition).</p></div>

<p>Another derivation suggested is that of <span class="smcap lowercase">AMBAGE</span>, a Latin word adopted
into the English language <i>temp.</i> Charles I. (<i>see</i> May’s translation of
Lucan’s <i>Pharsalia</i>), and meaning conduct the reverse of straightforward.
Again, in the (burlesque) <i>Loves of Hero and Leander</i>
(date 1642), we find “<span class="smcap">Mum-bug</span>, quoth he, ’twas known of yore,” a
cant expression, no doubt, commanding a person to “shut up,” or
hold his tongue, and evidently derived from the game of <i>mum-budget</i>
or <i>silence</i>, upon which Halliwell (<i>Dict. Arch</i>.) has descanted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">AMBAGE</span> is also used in the sense of “circumlocution.” “Without any long studie
or tedious <span class="smcap lowercase">AMBAGE</span>.”&mdash;<i>Puttenham</i>, <i>Art of Poesie</i>.</p>

<p>“Umh! y’ are full of <span class="smcap lowercase">AMBAGE</span>.”&mdash;<i>Decker’s Whore of Babylon</i>, 1607.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thus from her cell Cumæan Sibyl sings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambiguous <span class="smcap lowercase">AMBAGES</span>, the cloyster rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the shrill sound thereof, in most dark strains.”<br /></span>
</div>
<span class="sig"><i>Vicar’s Virgil</i>, 1632.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></div></div>

<p>De Quincey thus discourses upon the word:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The word <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span>, for instance, rests upon a rich and comprehensive basis; it
cannot be rendered adequately either by German or by Greek, the two richest
of human languages; and without this expressive word we should all be disarmed
for one great case, continually recurrent, of social enormity. A vast
mass of villany, that cannot otherwise be reached by legal penalties, or brought
within the rhetoric of scorn, would go at large with absolute impunity were it
not through the stern Rhadamanthean aid of this virtuous and inexorable
word.”&mdash;<i>Article on “Language.”</i></p></div>

<p>The original collater of these notes purchased the collection of essays
known as the <i>Connoisseur</i> at the sale of Thackeray’s library. At the
end of vol. i. he found a memorandum in the great humourist’s handwriting&mdash;“p.
108, ‘<span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span>,’ a new-coined expression.” On referring
to that page (in the 3rd edition, 1757) this paragraph was noted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The same conduct of keeping close to their ranks was observed at table, where
the ladies seated themselves together. Their conversation was here also confined
wholly to themselves, and seemed like the mysteries of the <i>Bona Dea</i>, in
which men were forbidden to have any share. It was a continued laugh and
whisper from the beginning to the end of dinner. A whole sentence was scarce
ever spoken aloud. Single words, indeed, now and then broke forth; such as,
odious, horrible, detestable, shocking, <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMBUG</span>. This last new-coined expression,
which is only to be found in the nonsensical vocabulary, sounds absurd
and disagreeable whenever it is pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady it
is ‘shocking,’ ‘detestable,’ ‘horrible,’ and ‘odious.’”</p></div>

<p>The use of this term is almost universal; in California there is a town
called Humbug Flat&mdash;a name which gives a significant hint of the
acuteness of the first settler.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Humdrum</b>, monotonous, tedious, tiresome, boring; “a society of
gentlemen who used to meet near the Charter House, and at the King’s
Head, St. John’s Street, Clerkenwell. They were characterized by
less mystery and more pleasantry than the Freemasons.”&mdash;<i>Bacchus and
Venus</i>, 1737. In the West the term applies to a low cart.</p>

<p><b>Humming</b>, strong as applied to drink. Extra strong ale is often characterized
as “<span class="smcap lowercase">HUMMING</span> October.” Maybe from its effect on heads
not quite so strong.</p>

<p><b>Hump</b>, low spirits. A costermonger who was annoyed or distressed
about anything would describe himself as having “the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMP</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Hump</b>, to botch, or spoil.</p>

<p><b>Hump up</b>, “to have one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMP UP</span>,” to be cross or ill-tempered&mdash;like
a cat with its back set up. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Back">BACK</a></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Monkey">MONKEY</a></span>.</p>

<div><p><b>Humpty-dumpty</b>, short and thick; all of a heap; all together, like
an egg.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<span class="smcap">Humpty-dumpty</span> sat on a wall.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Also a hunchback. <span class="smcap">Humpty</span> is an abbreviated form of the expression.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Hunch</b>, to shove, or jostle.</p>

<p><b>Hunks</b>, a miserly fellow, a curmudgeon.</p>

<p><b>Hunky</b>, an American term which means good, jolly, &amp;c. As, “a <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNKY</span>

<p><b>Hunter pitching</b>, the game of cockshies&mdash;three throws a penny.&mdash;<i>See</i>

<p><b>Hurdy-gurdy</b>, a droning musical instrument shaped like a large fiddle,
and turned by a crank, used by Savoyards and other itinerant foreign
musicians in England, now nearly superseded by the hand-organ. From
the peculiar noise made by the instrument, which in Italy is called
“viola.”</p>

<p><b>Hurkaru</b>, a messenger.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Husbands’ boat</b>, the Saturday afternoon packet to Margate during

<p><b>Hush-money</b>, a sum given to quash a prosecution or stay evidence.
Money given to any one for the purpose of quieting him.</p>

<p><b>Hush-shop</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CRIB</span>, a shop where beer and spirits are sold “on the
quiet”&mdash;no licence being paid.</p>

<p><b>Huxter</b>, money. Term much in use among costermongers and low
sharpers. Probably from <span class="smcap lowercase">OXTER</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Hoxter">HOXTER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Hyps</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">HYPO</span>, the blue devils. From <span class="smcap lowercase">HYPOCHONDRIASIS</span>.&mdash;<i>Swift.</i></p>

<p><b>Hy-yaw!</b> an interjectional exclamation of astonishment.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>Ikey</b>, a Jew “fence.” Corruption of Isaac, a common Hebrew name.</p>

<p><b>Imperence</b>, servant-girl currency for impudence or impertinence.
“Now, then, Mr. <span class="smcap">Imperence</span>, leave off now, do,” seems, however,
to have faded away with Greenwich, Bartlemy, and kindred fairs.</p>

<p><b>Improve the occasion</b>, a slang term much in use among Chadbands
and Stigginses, who never lose an opportunity of <span class="smcap lowercase">IMPROVING</span>
the condition of either pockets or stomachs at the expense of the
credulous.</p>

<p><b>In</b>, “to be <span class="smcap lowercase">IN</span> with a person,” to be even with, or up to him; also, to be
on intimate terms, or in partnership, with him.</p>

<p><b><a id="Inexpressibles"></a>Inexpressibles</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">UNUTTERABLES, UNMENTIONABLES, UNWHISPERABLES</span>,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">SIT UPONS</span>, trousers, the nether garments. All affected terms,
having their origin in a most unpleasant squeamishness.</p>

<p><b>Infantry</b>, nursery term for children; <span class="smcap lowercase">LIGHT INFANTRY</span>, fleas.</p>

<p><b>In for it</b>, in trouble or difficulty of any kind. As, “You’re <span class="smcap lowercase">IN FOR IT</span>,
I wouldn’t stand in your shoes for a trifle.”</p>

<p><b>In for patter</b>, waiting for trial, referring to the speeches of counsel, the
statements of witnesses, the summing up of the judge, &amp;c.,&mdash;the fuss
of which the prisoner sets down as “all so much <span class="smcap lowercase">PATTER</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Innings</b>, earnings, good fortune; “he’s had a long <span class="smcap lowercase">INNINGS</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, a
good run of luck, with plenty of cash flowing in. From the distinction
between <span class="smcap lowercase">INNINGS</span> and outings at cricket and kindred games.</p>

<p><b>Inside lining</b>, dinner, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Interesting</b>, “to be in an <span class="smcap lowercase">INTERESTING</span> situation,” applied to females
when <i>enceinte</i>.</p>

<p><b>Interview</b>, to inspect privately with a view to obtaining information
which shall be afterwards published. Both the verb and its use have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
their origin with our Transatlantic cousins, and “interviewing” by
means of special reporters, who question most minutely, is of frequent
occurrence,&mdash;of occurrence whenever opportunity offers. Should a
man be found guilty of murder, or start as a candidate for the Presidency,
he will be <span class="smcap lowercase">INTERVIEWED</span> by “our special correspondent,” and
there are already signs of this objectionable form of newspaper work
finding its way here. Should a visitor of importance arrive in New
York, the conversation which passes, or is supposed to pass, between
him and the reporter will be found minutely described, with an elaborate
introduction. It is but fair to Americans, however, to say that the
gentleman to whom the credit, or discredit, of the invention of this
system belongs was a native of Great Britain, who invented many other
startling Americanisms during his residence in New York.</p>

<p><b>Into</b>, “hold my hat, Jim, I’ll be <span class="smcap lowercase">INTO</span> him,” <i>i.e.</i>, I will fight him. In
this sense equivalent to pitch <span class="smcap lowercase">INTO</span>, or slip <span class="smcap lowercase">INTO</span>.</p>

<p><b>Invite</b>, an invitation&mdash;a corruption used by stuck-up people of mushroom
origin. Often used, also, by people who know better, from their
desire for slang of any kind.</p>

<p><b>Ipsal dixal</b>, Cockney corruption of <i>ipse dixit</i>&mdash;said of one’s simple uncorroborated
assertion.</p>

<p><b>Irish American</b>, an Irishman who has been for some time resident in
the States; sometimes a man born in America of Irish parents. The
Irish American body is a power in the United States, and is the fount-spring
as well as the maintaining power of all Fenianism.</p>

<p><b>Irish apricots</b>, potatoes.</p>

<p><b><a id="Irish_Cockney"></a>Irish Cockney</b>, a child born of Irish parents in any part of the southern
counties of England. It is a singular fact that Irishmen born profess
great abhorrence of <span class="smcap">Irish Cockneys</span>, while the latter despise all
Irish, and use the word as one of reproach. <span class="smcap">Irish Cockneys</span> were
originally only Cockneys born of an Irish strain, but the term has
proved very elastic, and threatens soon to mean any English-born person
whose descent is Hibernian. Liverpool will, however, always prove
an exception to the rule, as the name “Liverpool Irishmen” is given to
those who would in any southern part be called Cockneys.</p>

<p><b>Irish theatre</b>, the temporary prison, guard-room, or lock-up in a barracks.
The fond fancy of the soldier supplies it with other figurative
appellations, as “the mill,” “the jigger,” “the house that Jack built.”

in London streets to an ugly or unpleasant-looking person.</p>

<p><b><a id="Jacks"></a>Jacks</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">AND HALF-JACKS</span>, card counters, resembling in size and appearance
sovereigns and half-sovereigns, for which they are occasionally
passed to simple persons. In large gambling establishments the “heaps
of gold” are frequently composed of <span class="smcap lowercase">JACKS</span>. <span class="smcap">Jacks</span> are not, as they are
sometimes supposed to be, counterfeit coins; they are simply little
medals, and so “magsmen” and “street muggers” carry them with less
concern than they would feel were their pockets loaded with spurious

been found for <span class="smcap">Jarvey</span>, thus:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jarvey</span>, vernacular for Geoffrey, which
was often written Geo. (gee-ho), hence <span class="smcap">Jarvey</span>. This is open to considerable
objection, as George is shortened in similar manner to that
shown above. Still it is worthy of record, independently of its ingenuity,
being as exact as many accepted derivations.</p>

<p><b>Jaw</b>, speech, or talk; “hold your <span class="smcap lowercase">JAW</span>,” don’t speak any more; “what

<p><b>Jew fencer</b>, a Jew street salesman.</p>

<p><b>Jew’s eye</b>, a popular simile for anything valuable. Probably a corruption
of the <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GIOJE</span>; <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">JOAILLE</span>, a jewel. In ancient
times, when a king was short of cash, he generally issued orders for so
many <span class="smcap">Jews’ eyes</span>, or equivalent sums of money. The Jews preferred
paying the ransom, although often very heavy. It is notorious that in
this country the order often went forth to draw Jews’ teeth in the event
of their refusing to contribute so much to the Exchequer. A probable
idea is, that as a Jew’s teeth brought in so much money, the value of a
<span class="smcap">Jew’s eye</span> must be something fabulous. Possibly, also, from the <i>lex
talionis</i> so strongly believed in by Jews,&mdash;an eye for an eye, and
nothing less. The term is used by Shakspeare.</p>

<p><b>Jezebel</b>, a showily-dressed woman of suspected character; derived, of

<p><b>Jib</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">JIBBER</span>, a horse that starts or shrinks. Shakspeare uses it in the

<p><b><a id="Jib"></a>Jib</b>, the face, or a person’s expression; “the cut of his <span class="smcap lowercase">JIB</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, his peculiar
appearance. That sail of a ship, which in position and shape, corresponds
to the nose on a person’s face.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i> A vessel is often
known by the cut of the <span class="smcap lowercase">JIB</span> sail; hence the popular phrase, “to know
a man by the cut of his <span class="smcap lowercase">JIB</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Jibb</b>, the tongue.&mdash;<i>Gipsy</i> and <i>Hindoo</i>. (Tramps’ term.) Thence extended

<p><b>Jo</b>, Scotticism for a man or lover. As “John Anderson, my <span class="smcap lowercase">JO</span>, John.”</p>

<p><b>Job</b>, “a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span> lot,” otherwise called a “sporting lot,” any miscellaneous
goods purchased at a cheap rate, or to be sold a bargain. Frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
used to conceal the fact of their being stolen, or otherwise dishonestly
obtained.</p>

<p><b>Job</b>, a short piece of work, a prospect of employment. Johnson describes
<span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span> as a low word, without etymology. It is, and was, however, a
cant word; and a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span>, two centuries ago, was an arranged robbery.
Even at the present day it is mainly confined to the streets, in the
sense of employment for a short time. Amongst undertakers a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span>
signifies a funeral; “to do a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span>,” conduct any one’s funeral; “by
the <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, piece-work, as opposed to time-work. A <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span> in political
phraseology is a Government office or contract, obtained by secret
influence or favouritism. Any unfair arrangement is now called a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span>.</p>

<p><b>Job</b>, a sudden blow, as “a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span> in the eye.” Also used as a verb, “I’ll
<span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span> this here knife in your ribs.”</p>

<p><b>Jobation</b>, a chiding, a reprimand, a trial of the hearer’s patience.</p>

<p><b>Jobbery</b>, the arrangement of jobs, or unfair business proceedings.</p>

<p><b>Job’s comfort</b>, reproof instead of consolation.</p>

<p><b>Job’s comforter</b>, one who brings news of additional misfortunes. Both
these words are of Biblical origin.</p>

<p><b>Job’s turkey</b>, “as poor as <span class="smcap">Job’s turkey</span>,” as thin and as badly fed as

<p><b>Jocteleg</b>, a shut-up knife. Corruption of Jacques de Liège, a famous
cutler.</p>

<p><b><a id="Joe"></a>Joe</b>, a too marvellous tale, a lie, or a stale joke. Abbreviated from <span class="smcap">Joe
Miller</span>. The full name is occasionally used, as in the phrase “I don’t
see the <span class="smcap">Joe Miller</span> of it,” <i>i.e.</i>, I don’t perceive the wit you intend, or
I don’t see the fun of doing it,&mdash;whatever may have been the request.</p>

<div><p><b>Joey</b>, a fourpenny piece. The term is derived (like <span class="smcap">Bobby</span> from Sir
Robert Peel) from Joseph Hume. The explanation is thus given in
Hawkins’s <i>History of the Silver Coinage of England</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These pieces are said to have owed their existence to the pressing instance of
Mr. Hume, from whence they, for some time, bore the nickname of <span class="smcap">Joeys</span>. As
they were very convenient to pay short cab fares, the hon. M.P. was extremely
unpopular with the drivers, who frequently received only a groat where otherwise
they would have received a sixpence without any demand for change.”</p></div>

<p>The term, therefore, was originated by the London cabmen, who have
invented many other popular phrases. Fancy offering a modern hansom
cabman a <span class="smcap">Joey</span>!</p>
</div>

<p><b>Jog-trot</b>, a slow but regular trot, or pace.</p>

<p><b>Jogul</b>, to play up, at cards or other game. <i>Spanish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">JUGAR</span>.</p>

<p><b>John Blunt</b>, a straightforward, honest, outspoken man.</p>

<p><b>Johnny</b>, half-a-glass of whisky.&mdash;<i>Irish.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Johnny_Darbies"></a>Johnny Darbies</b>, a nickname for policemen, an evident corruption of
the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">GENSDARMES</span>. Also, a term applied to handcuffs.&mdash;<i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Darbies">DARBIES</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Johnny Raw</b>, a newly-enlisted soldier.</p>

<p><b><a id="John_Orderly"></a>John Orderly</b>, the signal to shorten the performance at a show.
Whenever the master, who remains on the platform outside to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the money and regulate the performance, desires to refill the booth, he
pokes his head inside and shouts, “Is <span class="smcap">John Orderly</span> there?” The
actors instantly cut the piece short, the curtain falls, and the spectators
are bundled out at the back, to make room for the fresh audience.
According to tradition, <span class="smcap">John Orderly</span> was a noted showman, who
taught this move to the no less noted Richardson. This is like the old
story of the publican who used to call out to his waiter, “A pot of ale,
Robert,” when he wished his customers to be served with the best;
but “A pot of ale, Bob,” when they had been drinking long enough
not to distinguish good stuff from the bad the latter order meant. One
day after calling for Bob many times, he reluctantly, at the request of a
visitor, tasted the ale, and found it was the best. Rushing out immediately
afterwards, and calling for Bob with all his voice, he was
answered by his wife, who said, “Why, Bob’s been out these three
hours.”</p>

<p><b>John Thomas</b>, a generic for “flunkeys,”&mdash;more especially footmen

<p><b>Jolly</b>, a Royal Marine.&mdash;<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Horse_marine">HORSE MARINE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Jolly"></a>Jolly</b>, a word of praise, or favourable notice; “chuck Harry a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOLLY</span>,
Bill,” <i>i.e.</i>, go and praise up his goods, or buy of him, and speak well
of the article, that the crowd standing around his stall may think it a
good opportunity for laying out their money. This is called <span class="smcap lowercase">JOLLYING</span>.
“Chuck a <span class="smcap lowercase">JOLLY</span>,” lit. translated, is, throw “a shout” or “good word.”</p>

<p><b>Jolly</b>, to abuse or vituperate, sometimes to “bear up” or “bonnet.” To
<span class="smcap lowercase">JOLLY</span> a man often means to give him a piece of one’s mind. To
<span class="smcap lowercase">JOLLY</span> “for” any one is another phase of the business mentioned in the
foregoing paragraph.</p>

<p><b>Jow</b>, be off, be gone immediately. If the word Jehanum be added, it
forms a peremptory order to go to a place unmentionable to ears
polite.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i> Our phrase, “Go to Jericho,” is probably a
modification of the Jehanum business.</p>

<p><b>Judas</b>, a deceitful person; <span class="smcap lowercase">JUDAS-HAIRED</span>, red-haired, deceitful. It is
generally believed that <span class="smcap">Judas Iscariot</span> was red-haired. Painters
seem to have accepted this idea, with modifications as to the exact
amount of colour.</p>

<p><b>Jug</b>, a prison of any kind. Contraction of “stone jug.”</p>

<p><b>Julep</b>, one of a set of drinks peculiar to America. Generally prepared
with mint, and called a <span class="smcap lowercase">MINT-JULEP</span>. Originally <span class="smcap lowercase">JULEP</span> was a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
liquid, in which nauseous medicines were taken. Its literal meaning
is rosewater, and it is derived from the Arabic.</p>

<p><b>Keep a pig</b>, an Oxford University phrase, which means to have a lodger.
A man whose rooms contain two bedchambers has sometimes, when
his college is full, to allow the use of one of them to a Freshman, who

said to <span class="smcap lowercase">KEEP A PIG</span>.</p>

<p><b>Keep it up</b>, to prolong a debauch, or the occasion of a rejoicing,&mdash;a

<div><p><b><a id="Kick_the_bucket"></a>Kick the bucket</b>, to die.&mdash;<i>Norfolk.</i> According to Forby, a metaphor
taken from the descent of a well or mine, which is of course absurd.
The Rev. E. S. Taylor supplies the following note from his MS. additions
to the work of the East-Anglian lexicographer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The allusion is to the way in which a slaughtered pig is hung up&mdash;viz., by passing
the ends of a bent piece of wood behind the tendons of the hind legs, and so
suspending it to a hook in a beam above. This piece of wood is locally termed
a <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCKET</span>, and so by a coarse metaphor the phrase came to signify to die.”</p></div>

<p>Another correspondent says the real signification of this phrase is to
commit suicide by hanging, from a method planned and carried out by
an ostler at an inn on the Great North Road. Standing on a bucket,
he tied himself up to a beam in the stable; he then <span class="smcap lowercase">KICKED THE
BUCKET</span> away from under his feet, and in a few seconds was dead.
The natives of the West Indies have converted the expression into
“kickeraboo.”</p>

<p><b>Kiddily</b>, fashionably or showily; “<span class="smcap lowercase">KIDDILY</span> togg’d,” showily dressed.</p>

<p><b>Kiddleywink</b>, a small shop where are retailed the commodities of a
village store. Originally <span class="smcap lowercase">KIDDLE-A-WINK</span>, from the offer made, with a
wink, to give you something out of the kettle or kiddle. In the west
country an alehouse. Also, a woman of unsteady habits.</p>

<p><b>Kiddy</b>, a man, or boy. Formerly a low thief.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Kidnapper</b>, originally one who stole children. Now applied without
reference to the age or sex of those stolen. From “kid,” a child, and
“nab” (corrupted to “nap”), to steal, or seize.</p>

<p><b>Kidney</b>, “of that <span class="smcap lowercase">KIDNEY</span>,” of such a stamp; “strange <span class="smcap lowercase">KIDNEY</span>,” odd
humour; “two of a <span class="smcap lowercase">KIDNEY</span>,” two persons of a sort, or as like as two
peas, <i>i.e.</i>, resembling each other like two kidneys in a bunch.&mdash;<i>Old.</i>
“Attempt to put their hair out of <span class="smcap lowercase">KIDNEY</span>.”&mdash;<i>Terræ Filius</i>, 1763.</p>

<p><b>Kid-on</b>, to entice or incite a person to the perpetration of an act.</p>

<p><b>Kidsman</b>, one who trains boys to thieve and pick pockets successfully.</p>

<p><b>Kilkenny cat</b>, a popular simile for a voracious or desperate animal or
person, from the story of the two cats in that county, who are said to
have fought and bitten each other until a small portion of the tail of
one of them alone remained.</p>

<p><b>Killing</b>, bewitching, fascinating. The term is akin to the phrase
“dressing to death.”</p>

<p><b>Kilt</b>, an Irishism for badly beaten, but by no means equivalent with killed.</p>

<p><b>Kimbo</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">A-KIMBO</span>, holding the arms in a bent position from the body,
and resting the hands upon the hips, in a bullying attitude. Said to
be from <span class="smcap lowercase">A SCHIMBO</span>, bandy-legged, crooked, <i>Italian</i>; but more probably
from <span class="smcap lowercase">KIMBAW</span>, the old cant for beating or bullying. <i>See Grose.</i>
<i>Celtic</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CAM</span>, crooked.</p>

<div><p><b>Kimmer</b>, a gossip, an acquaintance, same as <span class="smcap lowercase">CUMMER</span>.&mdash;<i>Scotch.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What’s a’ the steer, <span class="smcap lowercase">KIMMER</span>?”</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Kinchin</b>, a child.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i> From the <i>German</i> diminutive, <span class="smcap lowercase">KINDCHEN</span>,
a baby.</p>

<p><b>Kinchin cove</b>, a man who robs children; a little man.&mdash;Ancient Cant.</p>

<p><b>Kincob</b>, uniform, fine clothes, richly embroidered dresses. Really, cloth
of gold or silver.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Kingsman</b>, a handkerchief with yellow patterns upon a green ground,
the favourite coloured neckerchief of the costermongers. The women
sometimes wear <span class="smcap lowercase">KINGSMAN</span> kerchiefs thrown over their shoulders. A
coster will often imagine his caste, or position, is at stake, if his
<span class="smcap lowercase">KINGSMAN</span> is not of the most approved pattern. When he fights, his
<span class="smcap lowercase">KINGSMAN</span> is tied around his waist as a belt. This partiality for a
peculiar-coloured neckcloth is part of the fondness for gaudy colours
which at all times and in all countries has been shown by the uncultivated.
A strange similarity of taste for certain colours exists amongst
the Hindoos, Gipsies, and London lower classes. Red and yellow
(or orange) are the great favourites, and in these hues the Hindoo
selects his turban and his robe; the gipsy his breeches, and his wife
her shawl or gown; and the costermonger, his plush waistcoat and
favourite <span class="smcap lowercase">KINGSMAN</span>. Among either class, when a fight takes place,
the greatest regard is paid to the favourite coloured article of dress.
The Hindoo lays aside his turban, the gipsy folds up his fancy
breeches or coat, whilst the pugilistic costermonger of Covent Garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
or Billingsgate removes his favourite neckerchief to a part of his body,
by the rules of the “ring,” comparatively out of danger.</p>

<p><b>King’s pictures</b> (now, of course, <span class="smcap lowercase">QUEEN’S PICTURES</span>), money.</p>

<p><b>Kisky</b>, drunk, fuddled.</p>

<p><b>Kiss-curl</b>, a small curl twisted on the temple. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bow-Catcher">BOWCATCHER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Kissing-crust</b>, the soft crust which marks where one loaf has been
broken from another.</p>

<p><b>Kiss-me-quick</b>, the name given to the very small bonnets which have
of late years become fashionable.</p>

but now general.</p>

<p><b><a id="Knap"></a>Knap</b>, <i>i.q.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">NAP</span>, to break.&mdash;<i>Old English</i>, but nearly obsolete. <i>See Ps</i>.
xlvi. 9 (Prayer-book version), “He breaketh the bow, and <span class="smcap lowercase">KNAPPETH</span>
the spear in sunder;” probably sibilated into “snap.”</p>

<p><b>Knap</b>, to receive, to take. Generally applied to the receipt of punishments;
“oh, my! wont he just <span class="smcap lowercase">KNAP</span> it when he gets home!”</p>

<p><b>Knap</b>, to steal.&mdash;<i>Prison Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Knapping-jigger</b>, a turnpike gate; “to dub at the <span class="smcap lowercase">KNAPPING-JIGGER</span>,”
to pay money at the turnpike.</p>

<p><b>Knark</b>, a hard-hearted or savage person. The word is now usually
spelt <span class="smcap lowercase">NARK</span>, and is applied to the lowest class of informers.</p>

<p><b>Knife</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">KNIFE</span> a person,” to stab; an un-English custom, but a very
common expression.</p>

<p><b><a id="Knobstick"></a>Knobstick</b>, a non-society workman. One who takes work under price.</p>

<p><b>Knock about the bub</b>, to hand or pass about the drink. <span class="smcap">Bub</span> is a
very old cant term for drink.</p>

<p><b>Knock-down</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-ME-DOWN</span>, strong ale.</p>

<p><b>Knocked-up</b>, tired, jaded, used up, done for. In the United States,
amongst females, the phrase is equivalent to being <i>enceinte</i>, so that
Englishmen often unconsciously commit themselves when amongst our
Yankee cousins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Knock-’em-downs</b>, the game of skittles.</p>

<p><b>Knocker</b>, “up to the <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCKER</span>,” means finely or showily dressed, in

<p><b>Knock-in</b>, the game of loo.</p>

<p><b>Knocking-in</b>, coming into college after time. A habit of <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCKING-IN</span>
late generally leads to some unpleasantness.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Knocking-out.</b> All visitors, on leaving a college after time, have to
state in whose rooms they have been, that his gate-bill may be scored
up for them. When a rackety party takes place, the visitors, or “out
college men,” are generally supplied with a list of the names of the
quietest men in college, so that the whereabouts of the party may not
be betrayed.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Knock-it-down</b>, to show, in the “free and easy” style, approval of a
song or toast, by hammering with pot or glass on the table.</p>

<p><b>Knock off</b>, to give over, or abandon. A saying used by workmen in
reference to dinner or other meal times, for upwards of two centuries.</p>

<p><b>Knock out</b>, in racing parlance, to drive out of the quotations; as a
<span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCKED-OUT</span> favourite. Also to make bankrupt; as a <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCKED-OUT</span>
backer or bookmaker. When a man cannot meet his engagements
on the turf, he is said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCKED OUT</span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Knock-outs"></a>Knock-outs</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-INS</span>, disreputable persons who visit auction
rooms and unite to purchase the articles at their own prices. One of
their number is instructed to buy for the rest, and after a few small
bids as blinds to the auctioneer and bystanders, the lot is knocked
down to the <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-OUT</span> bidders, at a nominal price&mdash;the competition
to result from an auction being thus frustrated and set aside. At the
conclusion of the sale the goods are paid for, and carried to a neighbouring
public-house, where they are re-sold or <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCKED-OUT</span> among
the confederates, and the difference between the first purchase and the
second&mdash;or tap-room <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-OUT</span>&mdash;is divided amongst the gang. As
generally happens with ill-gotten gains, the money soon finds its way
to the landlord’s pocket, and the <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-OUT</span> is rewarded with a red
nose and a bloated face. Cunning tradesmen join the <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-OUTS</span>
when an opportunity for money-making presents itself. The lowest
description of <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-OUTS</span>, fellows with more tongue than capital, are
termed <span class="smcap lowercase">BABES</span>. Within the past few years a few respectable auctioneers,
assisted much by one or two just and admirable magisterial decisions,
have succeeded in considerably limiting the efforts of the <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOCK-OUT</span>
fraternity.</p>

<p><b>Knock-under</b>, to submit.</p>

<div><p><b>Knowing</b>, sharp, shrewd, artful; “a <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOWING</span> codger,” or “a <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOWING</span>
blade,” one who can take you in, or cheat you, in any transaction
you may have with him. It implies also deep cunning and foresight,
and generally signifies dishonesty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Know</span>, in this sense, enters into several slang phrases. “I <span class="smcap lowercase">KNOW</span>

<p><b>Knuckle-duster</b>, a large, heavy, or over-gaudy ring; a ring
which attracts attention from its size.</p>

<p><b>Knuckle-duster</b>, an iron or brass instrument which covers the
knuckles so as to protect them from injury when striking a blow, adding
force to it at the same time. Sometimes a <span class="smcap lowercase">KNUCKLE-DUSTER</span> has
knobs or points projecting, so as to mutilate and disfigure the person
struck. This brutal invention is American, but has been made familiar
here.</p>

<p><b>Knuckle to</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">KNUCKLE UNDER</span>, to yield or submit.</p>

<p><b><a id="Knuller"></a>Knuller</b>, old term for a chimney-sweep, who solicited jobs by ringing a

<p><b>Kye</b>, eighteenpence.</p>

<p><b>Kypsey</b>, a basket. A term generally used by gipsies.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>La!</b> a euphuistic rendering of <span class="smcap lowercase">LORD</span>! common amongst females and very
precise persons; imagined by many to be a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">LOOK</span>! but

<p><b>Lac</b>, one hundred thousand.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Laced</b>, strengthened with ardent spirits. Tea or coffee in which brandy

<p><b>Lacing</b>, a beating. From the phrase, “I’ll lace your jacket.”&mdash;<i>L’Estrange.</i>
Perhaps to give a beating with a lace or lash. Perhaps,
also, a figurative phrase for ornamenting the article in question with
stripes.</p>

<p><b>Ladder</b>, “can’t see a hole in a <span class="smcap lowercase">LADDER</span>,” said of any one who is intoxicated.
It was once said that a man was never properly drunk until he
could not lie down without holding, could not see a hole through a
<span class="smcap lowercase">LADDER</span>, or went to the pump to light his pipe.</p>

<p><b>Ladies’ mile</b>, that part of Hyde Park where the feminine beauty, rank,
and fashion most do congregate during the airing hours of the London
season.</p>

<p><b>Lag</b>, a returned transport, or ticket-of-leave convict.</p>

<p><b>Lag</b>, to void urine.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i> In modern slang to transport, as

<p><b>Lagged</b>, imprisoned, apprehended, or transported for a crime. From the

<p><b>Lagger</b>, a sailor. Also, one who gives evidence; an informer.</p>

<p><b>Lagging gage</b>, a chamber-pot.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Lambasting</b>, a beating. Perhaps <span class="smcap lowercase">LUMB-BASTING</span>, from the lumbar-regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb’s wool</span> is also a hot drink, well known to the community for
centuries. Supposed by some to be derived from Lammas, at which
time it was drunk, and by others to be derived from the similarity between
the foam of the drink and the white wool obtained from lambs.</p>
</div>


<p><b>Lame duck</b>, a stockjobber who speculates beyond his capital, and
cannot pay his losses. Upon retiring from the Exchange he is said to
“waddle out of the Alley.”</p>

<p><b>Lamming</b>, a beating.&mdash;<i>Old English</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">LAM</span>; used by Beaumont and
Fletcher. Not as Sir Walter Scott supposed, from one Dr. Lamb,
but from the <i>Old Norse</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">LAM</span>, the hand; also, <i>Gaelic</i>.</p>

<p><b>Lammy</b>, a blanket.</p>

<p><b><a id="Land-lubber"></a>Land-lubber</b>, sea term for “a landsman.” <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Loafer">LOAFER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Land-shark"></a>Land-shark</b>, a sailor’s definition of a lawyer.</p>

dressing-room for gin.</p>

<p><b>Lap</b>, one circuit of a pedestrian enclosure. In running a race of any

piece of fun.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">LAC</span>, sport; but more probably from the
nautical term <span class="smcap lowercase">SKYLARKING</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, mounting to the highest yards and
sliding down the ropes for amusement, which is allowed on certain
occasions.</p>

<p><b>Lark</b>, to sport boisterously, to show a disposition for “going on the
spree.”</p>

<p><b>Larrence</b>, an imaginary being, supposed by the Scottish peasantry to
have power over indolent persons. Hence laziness is often called
<span class="smcap lowercase">LARRENCE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Larrup</b>, to beat or thrash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Larruping</b>, a good beating or hiding.&mdash;<i>Irish.</i></p>

<p><b>Lashins</b>, large quantities; as, “<span class="smcap lowercase">LASHINS</span> of whisky.” An Irishism in
common use.</p>

<p><b>Lavender</b>, “to be laid up in <span class="smcap lowercase">LAVENDER</span>;” to be in pawn; to be

<p><b>Lay</b>, a pursuit or practice, a dodge. Term in this sense much used by
thieves.</p>

<p><b><a id="Lay"></a>Lay</b>, in wagering, to bet against a man or animal. Betters are divided

bookmakers and backers.</p>

<p><b>Lay</b>, some, a piece. “Tip me a <span class="smcap lowercase">LAY</span> of pannum,” <i>i.e.</i>, give me a slice of
bread.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b>Lay</b>, to watch; “on the <span class="smcap lowercase">LAY</span>,” on the look-out.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Hop_the_twig">HOPPING THE TWIG</a></span>, and similar flippancies.</p>

<p><b>Lead</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FRIENDLY LEAD</span>, a gathering at a low public-house, for the
purpose of assisting some one who is “in trouble” (in these cases
trouble always means imprisonment), who has just “come out of
trouble,” or who is in want of a “mouthpiece.” A <span class="smcap lowercase">LEAD</span> is different
from a raffle, inasmuch as no article is put up or thrown for, but in the
course of the evening some friend of the troubled one <span class="smcap lowercase">LEADS OFF</span> by
putting a certain sum in a plate, and the remainder of the party follow
the <span class="smcap lowercase">LEAD</span> with whatever they can spare. Sometimes people pay as
they enter the room, but this does not alter the title or character of the
meeting. In every other respect a <span class="smcap lowercase">LEAD</span> is similar to a raffle; songs,
dances, drinking, and a general desire to increase the bastardy averages
being the most conspicuous features of the entertainment. Irish <span class="smcap lowercase">LEADS</span>
and raffles are characterized by less vice and more quarrelling than
those of the lower orders of English people.</p>

<p><b>Leary</b>, flash, knowing, artful, sly.</p>

<p><b>Leary bloke</b>, a clever or artful person.</p>

<p><b>Leather</b>, to beat or thrash. Probably from allusion to the skin, which is
often called <span class="smcap lowercase">LEATHER</span>. Some think the term is from the <span class="smcap lowercase">LEATHER</span>
belts worn by soldiers, which are often used as weapons in street rows.
Most likely from there being “nothing like <span class="smcap lowercase">LEATHER</span>” with which
to administer a thrashing.</p>

<p><b>Leathern conveniency</b>, a carriage. A Quaker being reprimanded
by the Society of Friends for keeping a carriage, “contrary to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
ancient testimonies,” said, “it is not a carriage I keep, but merely a
<span class="smcap lowercase">LEATHERN-CONVENIENCY</span>.” <i>See</i> under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Simon_Pure_Int">Simon Pure</a></span>, in the Introduction.</p>

<p><b>Leaving shop</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Dolly_shop">DOLLY SHOP</a></span>, an unlicensed house where goods are
taken into pawn at exorbitant rates of interest.</p>

<p><b>Led captain</b>, a fashionable spunger, a “swell” who by artifice ingratiates
himself into the favours of the master of the house, and lives at
his table. Probably from the fact that a real captain leads, but that
a sham one is led&mdash;to the dinner-table.</p>

<p><b>Leer</b>, empty.&mdash;<i>Oxfordshire.</i> Pure <i>German</i>, as is nearly so the next word.</p>

<p><b>Leer</b>, print, newspaper. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">LEHREN</span>, to instruct; hence <i>Old English</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">LERE</span>, “spelt in the <span class="smcap lowercase">LEER</span>.” <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Spell">SPELL</a></span>.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Leg</b>, a part of a game. In some old games there are so many <span class="smcap lowercase">LEGS</span> to the
chalk, and so many chalks to the game. Sometimes the <span class="smcap lowercase">LEGS</span> are
called chalks, and the chalks <span class="smcap lowercase">LEGS</span>&mdash;one word is as good as another,
provided an agreement is made beforehand.</p>

<p><b>Leg</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BLACKLEG</span>, a disreputable sporting character and racecourse
<i>habitué</i>; that is, one who is disreputable among sporting men.</p>

<p><b>Leg-and-leg</b>, the state of a game when each player has won a <span class="smcap lowercase">LEG</span>. In
Ireland a <span class="smcap lowercase">LEG</span> is termed a horse, <span class="smcap lowercase">LEG-AND-LEG</span> being there termed
“horse-and-horse.”</p>

<p><b>Leg bail</b>, the bail or security given by absence. To give <span class="smcap lowercase">LEG BAIL</span> is to
run away.</p>

<p><b>Leg it</b>, to run; “to give a <span class="smcap lowercase">LEG</span>,” to assist, as when one mounts a horse;
“making a <span class="smcap lowercase">LEG</span>,” a countryman’s bow,&mdash;projecting the <span class="smcap lowercase">LEG</span> from
behind as a balance to the head bent forward.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Leg-of-mutton</b>, humorous street term for a sheep’s trotter, or foot.</p>

<p><b>Leg of mutton fist</b>, a large, muscular or bony hand.</p>

<p><b>Length</b>, forty-two lines of a dramatic composition.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Length</b>, six months’ imprisonment. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Stretch">STRETCH</a></span>.</p>

<div><p><b>Let alone</b>, an expression which signifies “much less” as used in comparative
statement or argument. “I cannot afford five shillings, <span class="smcap lowercase">LET

decamps without settling, he is said to <span class="smcap lowercase">LEVANT</span>. The <span class="smcap">Levant</span> was
also a notorious place for queer customers, who would do anything
rather than pay. Its reputation is not particularly odorous even now.</p>

which is the chief time for receiving feminine visitors at the

distinction; to conduct a stranger round the principal objects of attraction
in a place; to act as cicerone.</p>

<p><b>Lions</b>, notabilities, either persons or sights worthy of inspection; an
expression dating from the times when the royal lions at the Tower,
before the existence of Zoological Gardens and travelling menageries,
were a London wonder, to visit which country cousins and strangers
of eminence were constantly taken. Visitors taken round at Cambridge
to see the sights are, or were, called <span class="smcap lowercase">LIONS</span>. The origin of the Tower
collection was the three leopards sent by the Emperor Frederic to
Henry III., as a living illustration of the royal arms of England. In
the roll of John de Cravebeadell, constable of the Tower (<i>B. M. Top.
Collections</i>, iii. p. 153), is a charge of 3<i>d.</i> per day “in support of the
leopard of our lord the king.” Edward III., when Prince of Wales,
appears to have taken great interest in the animals; and after he
became king, there was not only the old leopard, but “one lion, one
lioness, and two cat-lions,” says Stowe, “in the said Tower, committed
to the custody of Robert, son of John Bowre.” The menagerie
was only abolished in 1834; and the practice was to allow any person
to enter gratis who brought with him a little dog to be thrown to the

or <span class="smcap lowercase">LOAFER</span>, however, was in general use as a cant term in the early
part of the last century. <span class="smcap">Landloper</span> was a vagabond who begged in

synonymous.</p>

<p><b>Long firm</b>, a gang of swindlers who obtain goods by false pretences.

length of their credit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Long-tailed beggar</b>, a cat. The tale that hangs thereby runs thus:&mdash;A
boy, during his first very short voyage to sea, had become so
entirely a seaman, that on his return he had forgotten the name of the
cat, and was obliged, pointing to puss, to ask his mother “what she
called that ’ere <span class="smcap lowercase">LONG-TAILED BEGGAR</span>?” Accordingly, sailors, when
they hear a freshwater tar discoursing too largely on nautical matters,
are very apt to say, “But how, mate, about that ’ere <span class="smcap lowercase">LONG-TAILED
BEGGAR</span>?”</p>

<p><b>Long-tailed-one</b>, a bank-note or “flimsy” for a large amount.</p>

<p><b>Long-tails</b>, among shooters, are pheasants; among coursers and dog-fanciers

University.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Longs-and-shorts"></a>Longs-and-shorts</b>, cards made for cheating.</p>

<p><b>Looking-glass</b>, a facetious synonym for a <i>pot de chambre</i>. This is
very old. The term arose from the fact that in ancient times this
utensil was the object of very frequent examination by the medical
fraternity. There is an old story of a lady who called at an inn, and
called for a <span class="smcap lowercase">LOOKING-GLASS</span> to arrange her hair, and who was presented
with a chamber utensil.</p>

<p><b>Loony</b>, a silly fellow, a natural. Corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">LOONEY TICK</span> (lunatic).

<p><b><a id="Loose-box"></a>Loose-box</b>, a brougham or other vehicle kept for the use of a <i>dame de

<p><b>Lord</b>, “drunk as a <span class="smcap lowercase">LORD</span>,” a common saying, probably referring to the
facilities a man of fortune has for such a gratification; perhaps a sly
sarcasm at the supposed habits of the aristocracy. This phrase had its
origin in the old hard drinking days, when it was almost compulsory
on a man of fashion to get drunk regularly after dinner.</p>

<p><b>Lord-mayor’s-fool</b>, an imaginary personage who likes everything that
is good, and plenty of it.</p>

<p><b>Lothario</b>, a “gay” deceiver; generally a heartless, brainless villain.</p>

<p><b><a id="Lour"></a>Lour</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">LOWR</span>, money; “gammy <span class="smcap lowercase">LOWR</span>,” bad money. From the Wallachian

<p><b>Love</b>, at billiards, rackets, and many other games, nothing: five points to
none would be “five <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span>,”&mdash;a <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span> game being when one player does
not score at all. The term is also used at whist, “six <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span>,” “four
<span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span>,” when one side has marked up six, four, or any other number,
and the other none. A writer in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for July,
1780, derives it either from <span class="smcap lowercase">LUFF</span>, an old Scotch word for the hand, or
from the <i>Dutch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">LOEF</span>, the <span class="smcap lowercase">LOOF</span>, weather-gauge (<i>Sewell’s Dutch Dictionary</i>,
4to, 1754); but it more probably, from the sense of the
following, denotes something done without reciprocity.</p>

<p><b>Love</b>, “to do a thing for <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, for nothing. A man is said to marry
for <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span> when he gets nothing with his wife; and an Irishman, with
the bitterest animosity against his antagonist, will fight him for <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span>,
<i>i.e.</i>, for the mere satisfaction of beating him, and not for a stake.</p>

<p><b>Loveage</b>, tap droppings, a mixture of stale spirits, sweetened and sold to
habitual dram-drinkers, principally females. Called also “alls.”</p>

<p><b>Low-water</b>, but little money in pocket, when the finances are at a low
ebb.</p>

an awkward fellow, a landsman.</p>

<p><b>Lubber’s hole</b>, an aperture in the maintop of a ship, by which a timid
climber may avoid the difficulties of the “futtock shrouds;” hence as
a sea-term the <span class="smcap lowercase">LUBBER’S HOLE</span> represents any cowardly way of evading
duty.</p>

<p><b>Luck</b>, “down on one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">LUCK</span>,” wanting money, or in difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Lucky</b>, “to cut one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">LUCKY</span>,” to go away quickly. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">STRIKE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Ludlam’s dog.</b> An indolent, inactive person is often said to be “as lazy
as <span class="smcap">Ludlam’s dog</span>, which leaned its head against the wall to bark.”
Sailors say “as lazy as Joe the Marine, who laid down his musket to
sneeze.”</p>

<p><b>Lug</b>, “my togs are in <span class="smcap lowercase">LUG</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, in pawn.</p>

<p><b>Lummy</b>, jolly, first-rate.</p>

<p><b>Lump</b>, anything exceptionally large, “as a <span class="smcap lowercase">LUMP</span> of a man,” “a great
<span class="smcap lowercase">LUMP</span> of a fellow,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Lump</b>, the workhouse; also called the Pan.</p>

<p><b>Lump it</b>, to dislike it; “if you don’t like it, you may <span class="smcap lowercase">LUMP IT</span>;” sometimes
varied to, “if you don’t like it, you may do the other thing.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Probably from the fact that, in bulk or in lump, the good has to be
taken with the bad. What you don’t like must be reckoned with the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LUMP</span>. To <span class="smcap lowercase">LUMP IT</span> is also to take off at a draught, as medicine or a
dram. “He <span class="smcap lowercase">LUMPED IT</span> down at once.”</p>

<p><b>Lump the lighter</b>, to be transported.</p>

<p><b>Lump work</b>, work contracted for, or taken by the <span class="smcap lowercase">LUMP</span>.</p>

<p><b>Lurch</b>, a term at the game of cribbage. A is said to <span class="smcap lowercase">LURCH</span> B when
the former attains the end, or sixty-first hole, of the board before the
latter has pegged his thirty-first hole; or, in more familiar words,
before B has turned the corner. A <span class="smcap lowercase">LURCH</span> sometimes, and then only
by agreement, counts as a double game or rub.</p>

<p><b>Lurk</b>, a sham, swindle, or representation of feigned distress. An imposition
of any kind is a <span class="smcap lowercase">LURK</span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Lurker"></a>Lurker</b>, an impostor who travels the country with false certificates of
fires, shipwrecks, &amp;c. Also, termed a <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Silver_beggar">SILVER BEGGAR</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Lush</b>, intoxicating drinks of all kinds, but generally used for beer. It is
generally allowed, as has been stated, that <span class="smcap lowercase">LUSH</span> and its derivatives
claim Lushington, the brewer, as sponsor.</p>

<p><b>Lush</b>, to drink, or get drunk.</p>

<p><b>Lush-crib</b>, a public-house.</p>

<p><b>Lushington</b>, a drunkard, or one who continually soaks himself with
lush. Some years since there was a <span class="smcap">Lushington Club</span> in Bow

for hanging first and trying afterwards.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

on the <span class="smcap lowercase">MACE</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, obtain goods on credit and never pay for
them; also termed “striking the <span class="smcap lowercase">MACE</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Mace</b>, to welsh, to obtain money without any expectation of being able to
pay or intention of paying.</p>

<p><b>Maceman</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">MACER</span>, a welcher, magsman, or general swindler; a
“street-mugger.”</p>

<p><b>Madza</b>, half. <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MEZZA</span>. This word enters into combination with
various cant phrases, mainly taken from the <i>Lingua Franca</i>, as <span class="smcap lowercase">MADZA
CAROON</span>, half-a-crown, two-and-sixpence; <span class="smcap lowercase">MADZA SALTEE</span>, a halfpenny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>

<p><b>Mag</b>, a halfpenny.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MAKE</span>. <span class="smcap">Megs</span> were formerly guineas.&mdash;<i>B.
M. Carew.</i> <span class="smcap">Make</span>, the old form, is still used by schoolboys in
Scotland. “Not a blessed <span class="smcap lowercase">MAG</span>!” would be the phrase of a cadger
down on his luck to express his penniless state.</p>

<p><b>Mag</b>, literary and printers’ slang for magazine.</p>

and persuasively.</p>

<p><b>Maggoty</b>, fanciful, fidgety. Whims and fancies were formerly termed
<span class="smcap lowercase">MAGGOTS</span>, from the popular belief that a maggot in the brain was the
cause of any odd notion or caprice a person might exhibit. Deer are
sometimes found to have maggots in their brains, which, perhaps,
accounts for the origin of the term.</p>

<p><b>Magsman</b>, a street swindler, who watches for countrymen and “gullible”
persons, and persuades them out of their possessions. <span class="smcap">Magsmen</span> are
wonderful actors. Their work is done in broad daylight, without any
stage accessories; and often a wink, a look, or a slip of the tongue
would betray their confederacy. Their ability and perseverance are
truly worthy of a better cause. <span class="smcap">Magsmen</span> are very often men of superior

named from Mrs. Malaprop, a character in Sheridan’s famous

Mrs. Partington the imitation.</p>

<p><b><a id="Mares_nest"></a>Mare’s nest</b>, a supposed discovery of marvels, which turn out no marvels
at all; from a story similar to that about the cock neighing. Three
Cockneys, out ruralizing, had determined to find out something about
nests. Accordingly, when they ultimately came upon a dungheap,
they judged by the signs therein that it must be a <span class="smcap lowercase">MARE’S NEST</span>, especially
as they could see the mare close handy. An old preacher in
Cornwall up to very lately employed a different simile, as, “It’s like
a cow calving up in a tree.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Marine"></a>Marine</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">MARINE RECRUIT</span>, an empty bottle. This expression having
once been used in the presence of an officer of marines, he was at first
inclined to take it as an insult, until some one adroitly appeased his
wrath by remarking that no offence could be meant, as all that it could
possibly imply was, “one who had done his duty, and was ready to
do it again.”</p>

<p><b>Martingale</b>, a gambling term, which means the doubling of a stake
every time you lose; so that when you win once you win back all
that you have lost. So called from the fact that, as in all fair games
you must win once, you have a safe hold of fortune. The difficulty is
to obtain a bank large enough to do this effectively, or having the bank
to find any one who will follow you far enough, in a fair game.</p>

<p><b>Mary Ann</b>, the title of the dea ex machinâ evolved from trades-unionism
at Sheffield, to the utter destruction of recalcitrant grinders. She is

streets.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i> <span class="smcap">Maung</span>, to beg, is a term in use amongst the
gipsies, and may also be found in the Hindoo vocabulary. <span class="smcap">Maund</span>,
however, is pure Anglo-Saxon, from <span class="smcap lowercase">MAND</span>, a basket. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase">BEG</span>,
which is derived from <span class="smcap lowercase">BAG</span>&mdash;a curious parallel.</p>

<p><b>Mean white</b>, a term of contempt among negroes, in the old slavery days,

to be “a man and brother.”</p>

<p><b>Measley</b>, mean, miserable-looking, “seedy;” “what a <span class="smcap lowercase">MEASLEY</span>-looking
man!” <i>i.e.</i>, what a wretched, unhappy fellow.</p>

<p><b><a id="Medical_Greek"></a>Medical Greek</b>, the slang used by medical students at the hospitals.
At the London University they have a way of disguising English, described
by Albert Smith as the Gower Street Dialect, which consists
in transposing the initials of words, <i>e.g.</i>, “poke a smipe”&mdash;smoke a
pipe; “flutter-by”&mdash;butterfly, &amp;c. This disagreeable nonsense, which
has not even the recommendation of a little ability in its composition,
is often termed Marrowskying. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Greek">Greek</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#St_Giles_Greeks">St. Giles’s Greek</a></span>, or the

<p><b><a id="Merry_Dun_Of_Dover"></a>Merry Dun of Dover</b>, a large ship figuring in sailors’ yarns. She
was so large that when passing through the Straits of Dover her flying
jib-boom knocked down Calais steeple; while, at the same time, the
fly of her ensign swept a flock of sheep off Dover cliffs. She was so
lofty that a boy who attempted to go to her mast-head found himself a
grey old man when he reached the deck again. This yarn is founded
on a story in the Scandinavian mythology. There is also a legend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
among sailors of the gallant Thunderbomb, which had “ninety-nine
decks and no bottom.”</p>

<p><b>Mesopotamia</b>, a name given to Eaton Square and neighbourhood when

<p><b>Midge net</b>, a lady’s veil.</p>

<p><b>Mike</b>, an Irish hodman, or general labourer.</p>

<div><p><b>Mike</b>, to loiter; or “lazy about.” The term probably originated in St.
Giles’s, which is thronged with Irish labourers, who rarely or never
labour (<span class="smcap">Mike</span> being so common a term with them as to become a
generic appellation for Irishmen), and who loiter and lean against the
public-houses in the “Dials.” It has been said that the term is Old
English, <span class="smcap lowercase">MICHE</span>, to skulk, to loiter; Old Norse, <span class="smcap lowercase">MAK</span>, leisure, idleness.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>
<span class="sig"><i>Shakspeare’s Hen. IV.</i>, ii. 4.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Whatever may have been its origin, there can be now no doubt that
the word is supposed to have particular reference to the habits of the
Irish <span class="smcap">Mikes</span>, or labourers, though now and again it is borrowed in the
interests of others.</p>
</div>


<p><b><a id="Mild"></a>Mild</b>, second-rate, inferior. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Draw">DRAW IT MILD</a></span>. Also feeble, inefficient,

<p><b>Milk</b>, a term used in connexion with racing; when a horse is entered in
a race for which his owner does not intend him to run, or at all events
in which he does not intend him to win, and bets against him, the animal
is said to “be <span class="smcap lowercase">MILKED</span>.” <span class="smcap">Milking</span>, is keeping a horse a favourite, at
short odds, for a race in which he has no chance whatever, or in which
he will not be allowed to try, for the purpose of laying against him.</p>

<p><b>Milky ones</b>, white linen rags.</p>

<p><b>Mill</b>, a fight, or set to. <i>Ancient Cant</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MYLL</span>, to rob. Probably from

and pelt him with flour, grease, and filth of various kinds, flour predominating.
This mode of punishing spies, informers, and other
obnoxious individuals, is used by cabmen, omnibus conductors, <i>et hoc
genus omne</i>. Eggs are useful missiles in an engagement of this
description. If rotten eggs are not obtainable, ordinary ones will do.</p>

<p><b>Miller.</b> This word is frequently called out when a person relates a stale

<p>“It is perhaps this humour of speaking no more words than we needs must which

<span class="smcap lowercase">MOSKENEERING</span> a profession&mdash;that is, they buy jewellery which, though
fairly good, is not so good as it seems, and pawn it as opportunity
occurs. It is notorious that some men can obtain a much larger sum
on a given article than others can; though the smallest of these professionals
generally manage to get good livings, which does not say
much for the judgment of those constant inspectors of personal property&mdash;pawnbrokers’
assistants.</p>

<i>Standard</i> newspapers, while united under the proprietorship of Mr.
Baldwin. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Gamp</span>, a monthly nurse, was a character in
Charles Dickens’s popular novel of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, who continually
quoted an imaginary <span class="smcap">Mrs. Harris</span> in attestation of the superiority of
her qualifications, and the infallibility of her opinions; and thus
afforded a parallel to the two newspapers, which appealed to each other
as independent authorities, being all the while the production of the
same editorial staff. <i>See</i> <a href="#Page_34">introductory article</a>.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. Jones</b>, the house of office, a water-closet.</p>

<p><b><a id="MT"></a>M.T.</b>, railway slang used by porters and pointsmen for empties, or empty

<p><b>Mullingar heifer</b>, a girl with thick ankles.&mdash;<i>Irish.</i> The story goes
that a traveller, passing through Mullingar, was so struck with this
local peculiarity in the women, that he determined to accost the next
one he met. “May I ask,” said he, “if you wear hay in your
shoes?” “Faith an’ I do,” said the girl; “and what then?”
“Because,” says the traveller, “that accounts for the calves of your
legs coming down to feed on it.”</p>

used with the affix of bloke when referring to a man. Phrase much
used by circus riders.</p>

<p><b><a id="Mungarly"></a>Mungarly</b>, bread, food. <span class="smcap">Mung</span> is an old word for mixed food, but <span class="smcap lowercase">MUNGARLY</span>
is doubtless derived from the <i>Lingua Franca</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MANGIAR</span>, to eat.
<i>See</i> the following.</p>

<p><b>Mungarly casa</b>, a baker’s shop; evidently a corruption of a
Lingua Franca phrase for an eating-house. The well-known “Nix
Mangiare” stairs at Malta derive their name from the endless beggars
who lie there and shout, “Nix mangiare,” <i>i.e.</i>, “Nothing to eat,” to
excite the compassion of the English who land there,&mdash;an expression
which exhibits remarkably the mongrel composition of the <i>Lingua
Franca</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MANGIARE</span> being Italian, and <i>Nix</i> (<i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">NICHTS</span>), an
evident importation from Trieste, or other Austrian seaport.</p>

<p><b>Munging</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">MOUNGING</span>, whining, begging, muttering.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b>Muns</b>, the mouth. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">MUND</span>.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

a species of monkey. Jacko Macauco, or Maccacco, as he was mostly

fifty years ago to display his prowess at the Westminster pit, where,
after having killed many dogs, he was at last “chawed up” by a bull
terrier.</p>

<p><b>Murphy</b>, a potato. Probably from the Irish national liking for potatoes,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MURPHY</span> being a surname common amongst the Irish. <span class="smcap">Murphies</span>
(edible) are sometimes called <span class="smcap lowercase">DONOVANS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Murphy</b>, “in the arms of <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, fast asleep. Corruption of

merchandize. This word is very generally used in commercial transactions
all over the world.</p>

<p><b>Mutton</b>, a contemptuous term for a woman of bad character; sometimes
varied to <span class="smcap lowercase">LACED MUTTON</span>. The expression was used as a cant term
for a “wild duck” in the reign of James I. As a slang term it was
employed by Ben Jonson in his masque of <i>Neptune’s Triumph</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was written for display at Court on Twelfth Night, 1623; “a fine
<span class="smcap lowercase">LACED MUTTON</span> or two,” are the words applied to wantons. Shakspeare
has the term. In that class of English society which does not lay any
claim to refinement, a fond lover is often spoken of as being “fond of
his <span class="smcap lowercase">MUTTON</span>,” which, by the way, in this place does not mean the
woman so much as something else.</p>

<p><b>Mutton chops</b>, a sheep’s-head. A man who has dined off sheep’s-head
dignifies his meal by calling it <span class="smcap lowercase">MUTTON CHOPS</span> (chaps).</p>

<p><b>Mutton-fist</b>, an uncomplimentary title for any one having a large and

of office.</p>

<p><b><a id="My_lord"></a>My lord</b>, a nickname given to a hunchback.</p>

<p><b>My tulip</b>, a term of endearment used by the lower orders to persons and
animals; “‘Kim up, <span class="smcap lowercase">MY TULIP</span>,’ as the coster said to his donkey when
thrashing him with an ash stick.”</p>

<p><b><a id="My_uncle"></a>My uncle</b>, the pawnbroker,&mdash;generally used when any person questions
the whereabouts of a domestic article. “Oh! only at <span class="smcap lowercase">MY UNCLE’S</span>” is
the reply. “Up the spout” has the same meaning. It is worthy of
remark that the French call this useful relative “ma tante,” my
aunt.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>Nab</b>, to catch, to seize; “<span class="smcap lowercase">NAB</span> the rust,” to take offence.&mdash;<i>Ancient</i>, fourteenth

<span class="smcap lowercase">NAILED</span>, taken up, or caught,&mdash;probably in allusion to the practice of
<span class="smcap lowercase">NAILING</span> bad money to the counter. We say, “as dead as a door-<span class="smcap lowercase">NAIL</span>;”
most possibly because of “apt alliteration.” Shakspeare has the expression
in <i>Henry IV.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Falstaff.</i> What! is the old king dead?</p>

<p><i>Pistol.</i> As <span class="smcap lowercase">NAIL</span> in door.”</p></div>

<p>Dickens, in that marvellous little book, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Old Marley was as dead as a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOOR-NAIL</span>.</p>

<p>“Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge what there is particularly
dead about a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOOR-NAIL</span>. I might have been inclined myself to
regard a <span class="smcap lowercase">COFFIN-NAIL</span> as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But
the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile: and my unhallowed hands shall
not disturb it, or the country’s done for. You will, therefore, permit me to
repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOOR-NAIL</span>.”</p></div>
</div>


<p><b><a id="Nail_in_ones_coffin"></a>Nail in one’s coffin</b>, a dram, “a drop o’ summat’ short,” a jocular,
but disrespectful phrase, used by the lower orders to each other at the
moment of lifting a glass of spirits to their lips. “Well, good luck!
here’s another <span class="smcap lowercase">NAIL IN MY COFFIN</span>.” This is probably in ridicule of
teetotal or temperance preachers, and the arguments adduced by them.
Another phrase with old topers is “shedding a tear,” also “wiping an
eye.”</p>

<p><b>Namby-pamby</b>, particular, over-nice, effeminate. This was possibly of
Pope’s invention, and first applied by him to the affected short-lined

<p><b>Nap nix</b>, a person who works at his trade, and occasionally goes on the
stage to act minor parts without receiving any pay. The derivation is
obvious. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Nap">NAP</a></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Nix">NIX</a></span>, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">NICHTS</span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Newgate_Knocker"></a>Newgate Knocker</b>, the term given to the lock of hair which costermongers
and thieves usually twist back towards the ear. The shape
is supposed to resemble the knocker on the prisoners’ door at Newgate&mdash;a
resemblance that carries a rather unpleasant suggestion to the
wearer. Sometimes termed a <span class="smcap lowercase">COBBLER’S KNOT</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">COW-LICK</span>.</p>

<p><b>Newmarket</b>, in tossing, when the game is “two out of three,” that is,
when he who gains the first two tosses wins. When the first toss is

<p><b>Nick</b>, or <span class="smcap">Old Nick</span>, the devil.&mdash;<i>Scandinavian</i>, <span class="smcap">Knickar</span>, one of the
names of Odin, as the destroying or evil principle.</p>

<p><b>Nick</b>, to hit the mark; “he’s <span class="smcap lowercase">NICKED</span> it,” <i>i.e.</i>, won his point. Also to
steal. To be “out on the <span class="smcap lowercase">NICK</span>,” is to be out thieving. Sometimes
described as being “on the pinch.”</p>

<div><p><b>Nimming</b>, stealing. <i>Old English</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">NIM</span>, to take. Motherwell, the
Scotch poet, thought the old word <span class="smcap lowercase">NIM</span> (to snatch or pick up) was
derived from <i>nam, nam</i>, the tiny words or cries of an infant, when
eating anything which pleases its little palate. A negro proverb has
the word:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Buckra man <span class="smcap lowercase">NAM</span> crab,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cram <span class="smcap lowercase">NAM</span> buckra man.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or, in the buckra man’s language&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“White man eat [or steal] the crab,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then crab eat the white man.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

Nym.</p>

<p><b>Nine corns</b>, a pipeful of tobacco.</p>

<p><b><a id="Ninepence"></a>Ninepence</b>, “nice as <span class="smcap lowercase">NINEPENCE</span>,” all right, right to a nicety. A correspondent
says:&mdash;“This most undoubtedly should be <span class="smcap lowercase">NINE-PINS</span>. For
at the game of that name, in fairness to both parties, the nine pins
must always be set up with great accuracy. There is no nicety in
<span class="smcap lowercase">NINEPENCE</span>!” Evidently this correspondent does not know how nice
it is to have ninepence, after being without money. At all events the
phrase <i>is</i> “nice as <span class="smcap lowercase">NINEPENCE</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Nines</b>, “dressed up to the <span class="smcap lowercase">NINES</span>,” in a showy or <i>recherché</i> manner. Up

Cant</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">NEB</span>. <span class="smcap">Nob</span> is an early English word, and is used in the romance
of <i>Kynge Alinaunder</i> (thirteenth century) for a head; originally, no
doubt, the same as <i>knob</i>.</p>

<p><b>Nob</b>, a person of high position, a “swell,” a <span class="smcap lowercase">NOB</span>leman,&mdash;of which word
it may be an abbreviation, or of <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBILIS</span>. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Snob">SNOB</a></span>.</p>

you got or collected from the crowd? This term is much used by
“buskers.”</p>

“<span class="smcap lowercase">NOBBLE</span>” a horse, is to “get at,” and lame or poison him.</p>

<p><b>Nobbler</b>, a blow on the <span class="smcap lowercase">NOB</span>, a finishing stroke; “that’s a <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBBLER</span> for
him,” <i>i.e.</i>, a settler.&mdash;<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>

<p><b>Nobbler</b>, a confederate of thimble-riggers and card-sharpers, who plays
earnestly, as if a stranger to the “rig,” and thus draws unsuspecting
persons into a game. The same as a “bonnet” or “bearer-up.” In
the North of England, a low, cunning lawyer.</p>

<p><b>Nobby</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBBISH</span>, fine or showy; <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBBILY</span>, showily. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Snob">SNOB</a></span> for

years back advertised, that for the future he would call himself by
the more aristocratic appellation of <span class="smcap">Norfolk Howard</span>.</p>

<p><b>North</b>, cunning. The inhabitants of Yorkshire and the Northern counties
are supposed, like the canny Scots, to get the better of other people in
dealing; hence the phrase, “He’s too far <span class="smcap lowercase">NORTH</span> for me,” <i>i.e.</i>, too
cunning for me to deal with.</p>

<p><b>North country compliment</b>, to give or offer anything that is not
wanted by either giver or receiver is to pass a <span class="smcap lowercase">NORTH COUNTRY
COMPLIMENT.</span></p>

<p><b>Norwicher</b>, more than one’s share; said of a person who leaves less
than half the contents of a tankard for his companion. In what way
the term originated, or why Norwich was selected before any other
city is not known. Most likely from the slanders which the inhabitants
of one town are always inventing about their neighbours.</p>

<p><b><a id="Nose"></a>Nose</b>, a thief who turns informer; a paid spy; generally called a policeman’s
<span class="smcap lowercase">NOSE</span>; “on the <span class="smcap lowercase">NOSE</span>,” on the look-out.</p>

<p><b>Nurse</b>, a curious term applied to competition in omnibuses. Two omnibuses
are placed on the road to <span class="smcap lowercase">NURSE</span>, or take care of, each opposition
“bus,” one before, the other behind. Of course the central or
<span class="smcap lowercase">NURSED</span> bus has very little chance, unless it happens to be a favourite
with the public. Recent legislation and tramways have done much to
do away with <span class="smcap lowercase">NURSING</span>. <span class="smcap">Nurse</span> also means to cheat or swindle;
trustees are sometimes said to <span class="smcap lowercase">NURSE</span> property, <i>i.e.</i>, gradually eat it up
themselves.</p>

<p><b>Nut</b>, the head, in pugilistic slang. Used as an exclamation at a fight, it

<p><b><a id="Oak"></a>Oak</b>, the outer door of college
rooms; to “sport one’s

to visitors. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Sport">SPORT</a></span>.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I put my <span class="smcap lowercase">OAR</span> in no man’s boat.”&mdash;<i>Thackeray.</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></div></div>
</div>


<p><b>Oat</b>, an atom. Probable corruption of iota, or perhaps from the small
size of an oat. “I never got an <span class="smcap lowercase">OAT</span> of it,” I never received the
smallest portion.</p>

<p><b>Oat-stealer</b>, an ostler.</p>

<p><b>Obfuscated</b>, intoxicated.</p>

<p><b>Obliquitous</b>, oblivious of distinction between right and wrong.&mdash;<i>American.</i></p>

<p><b>Obstropolous</b>, Cockney corruption of obstreperous.</p>

<p><b>Ochre</b>, money, generally applied to gold, for a very obvious reason.</p>

<p><b>O’clock</b>, “like <span class="smcap lowercase">ONE O’CLOCK</span>,” a favourite comparison with the lower
orders, implying briskness; otherwise “like winkin’.” “To know
what’s <span class="smcap lowercase">O’CLOCK</span>” is to be wide-awake, sharp, and experienced.</p>

<p><b>Odd man out</b>, a street or public-house game at tossing. The number
of players is three or more. Each tosses up a coin, and if two come
down head, and one comes tail, or <i>vice versâ</i>, the <span class="smcap lowercase">ODD MAN</span> loses or
wins, as may have been agreed upon. Frequently used to victimize
a “flat.” If all be alike, then the toss goes for nothing, and the
coppers are again “skied.” It is easy for two men to arrange matters
beforehand at this game, and so swindle a third.</p>

<p><b>Odd man</b>, a man who trains in company with a boat’s crew, so that in
the event of any one falling ill the seat will be fairly occupied.</p>

<p><b>Odds</b>, a phrase equivalent to “consequence;” “what’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">ODDS</span>?”
<i>i.e.</i>, what is the expected result? “It’s no <span class="smcap lowercase">ODDS</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, of no consequence.
<span class="smcap lowercase">ODDS</span>, in sporting phraseology, refers to the proportions or
differences of a bet. One bookmaker will lay <span class="smcap lowercase">ODDS</span> of “six to one”
against such a horse winning; whilst another, more speculative, or in
the receipt of a first-rate “tip” (information about the horse in question)
will lay “eight,” or even “ten to one.”</p>

<p><b>Od rot it</b> (<i>Colman’s Broad Grins</i>), <span class="smcap lowercase">DRAT IT, OD’S BLOOD</span>, and all other
exclamations commencing with <span class="smcap lowercase">OD</span>, are nothing but softened or suppressed
oaths. <span class="smcap">Od</span> is a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">GOD</span>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">DRAT</span> of <span class="smcap lowercase">ROT</span>.</p>

<p><b>Off and on</b>, vacillating; “an <span class="smcap lowercase">OFF AND ON</span> kind of a chap,” one who
is always undecided.</p>

<p><b>Off at the head</b>, crazy.&mdash;<i>Oxfordshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Off one’s chump.</b> To be crazy is to be <span class="smcap lowercase">OFF ONE’S CHUMP</span>; this is varied
by the word <span class="smcap lowercase">CHUMPY</span>. A mild kind of lunatic is also said to be “off
his head,” which means of course exactly the same as the first phrase.</p>

<p><b>Off one’s feed.</b> To be unable to eat is to be <span class="smcap lowercase">OFF ONE’S FEED</span>. Originally
stable slang.</p>

<p><b>Off the horn</b>, a term used in reference to very hard steak, which is
fancifully said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">OFF THE HORN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Office</b>, “to give the <span class="smcap lowercase">OFFICE</span>,” to give a hint dishonestly to a confederate,
thereby enabling him to win a game or bet, the profits being
shared. Also in sporting phraseology to give any information worth
having.</p>

<p><b>Offish</b>, distant, not familiar. Corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">STAND-OFFISH</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Ogle</b>, to look, or reconnoitre.</p>

<p><b>Ogles</b>, eyes.&mdash;<i>Old Cant. French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ŒIL</span>.</p>

<p><b>Oil of palms</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">PALM OIL</span>, money.</p>

<p><b>Ointment</b>, medical student slang for butter.</p>

<p><b>O. K.</b>, a matter to be <span class="smcap lowercase">O. K.</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">OLL KORRECT</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, all correct), must be on
the “square,” and perfectly in order. This is an Americanism, and
is derived from the initials <span class="smcap lowercase">O. K.</span>, said to have been marked on a document
by an official to signify that all was right and proper.</p>

<p><b>Old boots</b>, a simile as general in its application as it is irrelevant. “Like
<span class="smcap lowercase">OLD BOOTS</span>” means like anything. “As cheeky as <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD BOOTS</span>;” “As
quick as <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD BOOTS</span>,” seem a little more reasonable, new boots being
somewhat unfavourable to speedy locomotion.</p>

<p><b>Old dog</b>, a knowing blade, an experienced person. Butler uses the
phrase, <i>Hudibras</i>, part ii. canto iii. 208, where it was said of Sidrophel,
“And was <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD DOG</span> at physiology.” An Irish proverb says,
“<span class="smcap lowercase">OLD DOG</span> for hard road,” meaning that it requires an experienced
person to execute a difficult undertaking.</p>

<p><b>Old gentleman</b>, the devil. Also a card almost imperceptibly longer
than the rest of the pack, used by sharpers for the purpose of cheating.</p>

<p><b>Old gooseberry</b> (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Gooseberry">GOOSEBERRY</a></span>), <span class="smcap">Old Harry</span> (<i>Old Hairy</i>), <span class="smcap">Old

<p><b>Old gown</b>, smuggled tea.</p>

<p><b><a id="Old_horse"></a>Old horse</b>, salt junk, or beef.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Old hoss</b>, a term of endearment, originally an Americanism, but now
in common use here among friends.</p>

<p><b>Old Lady in Threadneedle Street</b>, the Bank of England.</p>

<p><b>Old man</b>, in American merchant ships, the master. The phrase is becoming
common in English ships.</p>

<p><b>Old salt</b>, a thorough sailor.</p>

<p><b>Old Tom</b>, extra strong gin; sometimes termed <span class="smcap lowercase">CAT’S WATER</span>. Various
reasons are given for the use of the words <span class="smcap">Old Tom</span>. The distillers
have the sign of a tom cat on their illuminated placards. The origin
of the phrase is, however, in the fact that the managing clerk of a once
celebrated “gin-spinning” firm, who was known as <span class="smcap">Old Tom</span>,
used to keep a special bottle of extra good stuff with which to regale
customers when they settled their accounts. To get a drink of <span class="smcap">Old
Tom’s</span> was then a great favour. Gradually the title became popular
as representing very good strong gin.</p>

<p><b><a id="Oliver"></a>Oliver</b>, the moon; “<span class="smcap lowercase">OLIVER</span> don’t widdle,” <i>i.e.</i>, the moon does not

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Omnium gatherum</b>, an indiscriminate collection of articles; a numerous
and by no means select assemblage.</p>

<p><b>On</b>, “to be <span class="smcap lowercase">ON</span>,” in public-house or vulgar parlance, is synonymous with
getting “tight” or tipsy; “it’s St. Monday with him, I see he’s <span class="smcap lowercase">ON</span>
again,” <i>i.e.</i>, drunk as usual, or on the road to it. “I’m <span class="smcap lowercase">ON</span>” also expresses
a person’s acceptance of an offered bet. To <span class="smcap lowercase">GET ON</span> a horse or
a man is to make bets on it or him. “Try it <span class="smcap lowercase">ON</span>,” a defiant challenge
to a person.</p>

<p><b>On the fly</b>, getting one’s living by thieving or other illegitimate means;
the phrase is applied to men the same as “on the loose” is to women.
<span class="smcap">On the fly</span> also means on the drink.</p>

<p><b><a id="On_the_loose"></a>On the loose</b>, obtaining a living by prostitution; in reality, on the

different meaning.</p>

to the London cats on their amatory excursions. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Caterwauling">CATERWAULING</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>One-er</b>, that which stands for <span class="smcap lowercase">ONE</span>, a blow that requires no repeating. In
<i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, the “Marchioness” tells Dick Swiveller that
“her missus is a <span class="smcap lowercase">ONE-ER</span>”&mdash;there a variation of “stunner.”</p>

<p><b>One in ten</b>, a parson. In allusion to the tithing system.</p>

<p><b>Ottomy</b>, a thin man, a skeleton, a dwarf. Vulgar pronunciation of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANATOMY</span>. Shakspeare has <span class="smcap lowercase">ATOMY</span>.</p>

<p><b>Out</b>, a dram glass. These glasses are two-<span class="smcap lowercase">OUT</span> (half-quartern), three-<span class="smcap lowercase">OUT</span>,
and four-<span class="smcap lowercase">OUT</span>. An <i>habitué</i> of a gin-shop, desirous of treating a brace
of friends, calls for “a quartern of gin and three <span class="smcap lowercase">OUTS</span>,” by which he
means three glasses which will exactly contain the quartern. Really,
the word glasses is understood. The man actually means, and one
or more three-<span class="smcap lowercase">OUT</span> glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Out</b>, in round games, where several play, and there can be but one loser,
the winners in succession <span class="smcap lowercase">STAND OUT</span>, while the others <span class="smcap lowercase">PLAY OFF</span>.</p>

<p><b>Out and out</b>, prime, excellent, of the first quality; beyond measure.
<span class="smcap">Out-and-outer</span>, one who is of an <span class="smcap lowercase">OUT-AND-OUT</span> description, “up”
to anything.</p>

<div>
<p>An ancient MS. has this couplet, which shows the antiquity of the
phrase:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And she was wycked <span class="smcap lowercase">OUTE AND OUTE</span>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>


<p><b>Outcry</b>, an auction.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Outing</b>, a day’s holiday. The Oxford and Cambridge boatrace, the
Derby, and other events of a like character, are each said to be simply
excuses to the Cockneys for a day’s <span class="smcap lowercase">OUTING</span>.</p>

<p><b>Out of collar</b>, out of place,&mdash;in allusion to servants. When in place,
the term is <span class="smcap lowercase">IN COLLAR</span>. Most likely from “head in the <span class="smcap lowercase">COLLAR</span>,”
said of horses when hard at work.</p>

<p><b>Out on the loose</b>, “on the spree,” in search of adventures. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#On_the_loose">ON
THE LOOSE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Out on the pickaroon.</b> <span class="smcap">Picarone</span> is Spanish for a thief, but this
phrase does not necessarily mean anything dishonest, but is often used
to mean readiness for anything in the way of excitement. It also means
to be in search of anything profitable, without much care as to honesty
or otherwise.</p>

<p><b>Outsider</b>, a person who does not habitually bet, or is not admitted to the
“ring,” a duffer or good-for-nothing fellow. Also, a horse whose name
does not appear among the “favourites.”&mdash;<i>Sporting.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Over"></a>Over!</b> or <span class="smcap lowercase">OVER THE LEFT</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, the left shoulder&mdash;a common exclamation
of disbelief in what is being narrated,&mdash;sometimes implying that the
results of a proposed plan will be <span class="smcap lowercase">OVER THE LEFT</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, in the wrong
direction, loss instead of gain.</p>

<p><b>Over</b>, generally used in connexion with come, as, “He came it rather strong
<span class="smcap lowercase">OVER</span> me,” <i>i.e.</i>, tried to intimidate or compel me. The same phrase
would also be used to imply that an excess of flattery or praise was
being employed for a similar purpose, but that the adulation was
being “laid on a little too thick” to be considered genuine. Also used
thus sometimes: “You mustn’t come Shakspeare <span class="smcap lowercase">OVER</span> me,” <i>i.e.</i>, “you
mustn’t assume an air of immeasurable literary superiority <span class="smcap lowercase">OVER</span> me.”
“You mustn’t come Rothschild <span class="smcap lowercase">OVER</span> me,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Over</b>, in cricket, four balls delivered from one end to another. After an
<span class="smcap lowercase">OVER</span> has been bowled, the fielders, wicket-keepers, &amp;c., change ends,
and the bowling goes on from the recent batting wicket. A <span class="smcap lowercase">MAIDEN-OVER</span>
is an <span class="smcap lowercase">OVER</span> from which no runs are obtained. Four balls is the
regulation number to an <span class="smcap lowercase">OVER</span> in all important matches; but little
clubs and practice elevens suit their own convenience.</p>

<p><b><a id="Overs"></a>Overs</b>, the odd money remaining after the daily accounts are made up at
a banking-house,&mdash;usually divided amongst the clerks. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Menavelings">MENAVELINGS</a></span>

<p><b><a id="Owned"></a>Owned</b>, a slang expression used by the ultra-Evangelicals when a popular
preacher makes many converts. The converts themselves are called
his “seals.”</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<div><p><b><a id="P_P"></a>P. P.</b>, an expression much in use among racing men, which means play or
pay, <i>i.e.</i>, either go on with the arrangement or forfeit the money.
The following is a law of the turf on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following races shall be considered “play or pay”:&mdash;The Derby and Oaks
at Epsom, the St. Leger at Doncaster, the Two Thousand Guineas, the
One Thousand Guineas, the Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire, at Newmarket,
the Ascot, Goodwood, and Doncaster Cups, and all handicaps above 200 sovs.
value with two forfeits, the minor of which shall not be less than 5 sovs.; and
the Committees of Tattersall’s, and of the Subscription Room at Newmarket,
will take no cognisance of any disputes respecting “play or pay” bets on any
other races, or of any bets made upon handicap races before the weights are
published.</p></div>

<p>This is the exact law on the subject, but as a rule all bets on horse-racing
are considered <span class="smcap lowercase">P. P.</span> unless otherwise arranged. In all matches,
though, whether turf, pedestrian, aquatic, or otherwise, a run is given
for the money in ordinary betting transactions.</p>
</div>


<p><b>P’s and q’s</b>, particular points, precise behaviour; “mind your <span class="smcap lowercase">P’S</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">Q’S</span>,” be very careful. Originating, according to some, from the similarity
of <span class="smcap lowercase">P’S</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">Q’S</span> in the hornbook alphabet, and therefore the warning
of an old dame to her pupils, or, according to others, of a French
dancing-master to his pupils, to mind their <i>pieds</i> (feet) and <i>queues</i>
(wigs) when bowing.</p>

<p><b>Pack</b>, to go away; “now, then, <span class="smcap lowercase">PACK</span> off there,” <i>i.e.</i>, be off, don’t
stop here any longer.&mdash;<i>Old.</i> “Make speede to flee, be <span class="smcap lowercase">PACKING</span> awaie.”&mdash;<i>Baret’s
Alvearie</i>, 1580. Contraction of “<span class="smcap lowercase">PACK</span> up and be off.”
Sometimes the term “sent <span class="smcap lowercase">PACKING</span>” is used to indicate a sudden discharge,
as of a servant or mistress.</p>

<p><b>Packets</b>, hoaxing lies. Sometimes used as an exclamation of incredulity.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b>Pad</b>, “to stand <span class="smcap lowercase">PAD</span>,” to beg with a small piece of paper pinned on the
breast, inscribed, “I am starving.”</p>

<p><b>Pad</b>, the highway; also a tramp or itinerant musician.</p>

<div><p><b>Pad the hoof</b>, to walk; “<span class="smcap lowercase">PADDING THE HOOF</span>, on the high toby,”
tramping or walking on the high road.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Trudge, plod away o’ the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOF</span>.”&mdash;<i>Merry Wives</i>, i. 3.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Padding</b>, the light articles in the monthly magazines, of which the serial
stories are the main attraction. Publishers of magazines seem to
think that if they get a serial story from a popular novelist they can
pack any amount of rubbish into the remaining pages. This is not
so in America, as magazines like the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and the <i>Overland
Monthly</i> show.</p>

<p><b>Padding-ken</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CRIB</span>, tramps’ and boys’ lodging-house.</p>

<p><b>Paddle</b>, to go or run away.&mdash;<i>American.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<div>
<p><b>Paddy</b>, <span class="smcap">Pat,</span> or <span class="smcap">Paddy Whack</span>, an Irishman. A nickname of <span class="smcap">Patrick</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’m <span class="smcap">Paddy Whack</span>, from Ballyhack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not long ago turn’d soldier;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">None other can be boulder.”&mdash;<i>Irish Song.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>


<p><b>Paddy’s goose</b>, the sign of the White Swan, a noted flash public-house
in the east of London, supposed to be Paddy’s idea of a <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOSE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Paddy’s land</b>, “ould Ireland.”</p>

<p><b>Padre</b>, a clergyman. From the Portuguese.</p>

<p><b><a id="Pal"></a>Pal</b>, a partner, acquaintance, friend, an accomplice. <i>Gipsy</i>, a brother.</p>

<p><b>Palampo</b>, a quilt or bed-cover. Probably from <span class="smcap">Palanpore</span>, a town in
India, renowned for its manufacture of chintz counterpanes.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Palaver</b>, to ask, or talk&mdash;deceitfully or otherwise, as occasion requires;
“<span class="smcap lowercase">PALAVER</span> to his nibs for a shant of bivvy,” ask the master for
a pot of beer. <span class="smcap">Nantee palaver</span> (pronounced <span class="smcap lowercase">PERLARVER</span>), cease
talking. In this sense used by tramps. Derived from the Portuguese.</p>

<p><b>Pall</b>, to stop; “<span class="smcap lowercase">PALL</span> that,” spoken authoritatively, means, cease what
you are doing. From <span class="smcap lowercase">PALL</span>, a small instrument which is used to stop
the windlass or capstan at sea. When a man says, “I am <span class="smcap lowercase">PALLED</span>,”
he means he cannot or dare not say any more. A sailor, on receiving
any extraordinary intelligence, will say, “You <span class="smcap lowercase">PALL</span> me,” <i>i.e.</i>, you
confound me. Most likely from the order frequently given on board
ship, “Ease and <span class="smcap lowercase">PALL</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Palm</b>, to impose upon. “You can’t <span class="smcap lowercase">PALM</span> that off upon me,” is said
when an intending purchaser is suspicious of the quality of the article
offered.</p>

<p><b>Palm oil</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">PALM SOAP</span>, money; also, a bribe.</p>

<p><b>Palmer</b>, a swindler who used to visit shops under the pretence of collecting
harp halfpence. To induce shopkeepers to search for them, he offered
thirteenpence for one shilling’s-worth, when many persons were silly
enough to empty a large quantity of copper on their counters. The
<span class="smcap lowercase">PALMER</span>, a proficient with his fingers, generally contrived to conceal
some before he left the shop.</p>

<p><b>Palming</b>, robbing shops by pairs&mdash;one thief bargaining with apparent
intent to purchase, whilst the other watches his opportunity to steal.
The following anecdote will give an idea of their <i>modus operandi</i>. A
man once entered a “ready-made” boot and shoe shop, and desired to
be shown a pair of boots&mdash;his companion staying outside and amusing
himself by looking in at the window. The one who required to be
fresh shod was apparently of a humble and deferential turn, for he
placed his hat on the floor directly he stepped into the shop. Boot
after boot was tried on until at last a fit was obtained, when in
rushed a man, snatched up the customer’s hat left near the door, and
ran down the street as fast as his legs could carry him. Away went
the customer after his hat, and Crispin, standing at the door, clapped
his hands, and shouted, “Go it, you’ll catch him!”&mdash;little thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
it was a concerted trick, and that neither his boots nor the customer
would ever return. Instances of this kind of work frequently occur.
<span class="smcap lowercase">PALMING</span> sometimes refers to secreting money or rings in the hand,
as well as to bribing. <span class="smcap">Palming</span> is also the generic term for all
that kind of conjuring which depends on manual dexterity, and which
is totally distinct from the mechanical-contrivance department.</p>

<p><b>Pam</b>, the knave of clubs at the game of loo; or, in street phraseology,
while the “Judicious Bottleholder” was alive, Lord Palmerston.</p>

<p><b><a id="Pannikin"></a>Pannikin</b>, a small pan.</p>

<p><b>Pannum</b>, food, bread.&mdash;<i>Lingua Franca</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PANNEN</span>; <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PANIS</span>;
<i>Ancient Cant</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">YANNAM</span>.</p>

<p><b>Pannum-bound</b>, said of a pauper or prisoner when his food is stopped.
<span class="smcap">Pannum-struck</span>, very hungry, starving.</p>

<p><b>Panny</b>, a house&mdash;public or otherwise; “flash <span class="smcap lowercase">PANNY</span>,” a public-house
used by thieves; <span class="smcap lowercase">PANNY-MEN</span>, housebreakers. <span class="smcap">Panny</span>, in thieves’
cant, also signifies a burglary.</p>

<p><b>Pantalettes</b>, the drawers worn in America by little girls.</p>

<p><b><a id="Pantile"></a>Pantile</b>, a hat. The term <span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILE</span> is properly applied to the mould into
which the sugar is poured which is afterwards known as “loaf sugar.”
Thus, <span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILE</span>, from whence comes the phrase, “a sugar-loaf hat,”
originally signified a tall, conical hat, in shape similar to that usually
represented as the head-gear of a bandit. From <span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILE</span> the more
modern slang term <span class="smcap lowercase">TILE</span> has been derived. Halliwell gives <span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILE
SHOP</span>, a meeting-house, from the steeple-crowned or <span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILE</span> hats of
its frequenters. <span class="smcap">Pantile</span> also means a flat cake with jam on it, given
to boys at boarding-schools instead of pudding.</p>

<p><b>Pantiler</b>, a Dissenting preacher. Probably from the practice of the
Quakers, and many Dissenters, of not removing their hats in a place of
worship; or from the sugar-loaf hats originally worn by Puritans.
Another derivation is from the earthen tiles, technically <span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILES</span>
(tiles hollowed in the middle, as distinguished from “pintiles,” the
older sort, which are flat, smaller, and pinned or nailed to the rafters),
with which meeting-houses of Dissenters are usually covered; hence
the meeting-house came to be called a <span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILE</span>, and its frequenters
<span class="smcap lowercase">PANTILERS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Pants</b>, American term for trousers. Here used to represent the long
drawers worn underneath.</p>

<p><b>Panupetaston</b>, a loose overcoat with wide sleeves, now out of fashion.&mdash;<i>Oxford
University.</i></p>

<p><b>Paper-maker</b>, a rag-gatherer, or gutter-raker&mdash;similar to the chiffonnier
of Paris. Also, a man who tramps through the country, and collects
rags on the pretence that he is an agent to a paper mill.</p>

<p><b>Paper-Worker</b>, a wandering vendor of street literature; one who sells
ballads, dying speeches, and confessions, sometimes termed a “running
stationer.”</p>

<p><b>Parachute</b>, a parasol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Paradise</b>, French slang for the gallery of a theatre, “up amongst the
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Gods">GODS</a></span>,” which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Parish lantern</b>, the moon.</p>

<p><b>Parish prig</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">PARISH BULL</span>, a parson.&mdash;<i>Thieves’ cant.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Parney"></a>Parney</b>, rain; “dowry of <span class="smcap lowercase">PARNEY</span>,” a quantity of rain. <i>Anglo-Indian</i>
slang from the <i>Hindoo</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PANI</span>, water; <i>Gipsy</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PANE</span>. Old Indian officers
always call brandy-and-water “brandy <span class="smcap lowercase">PAWNEE</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Parson</b>, a signpost. Common term in the north, where they say that the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARSON</span> points, but does not lead. This is given, as the lawyers say,
“without prejudice.”</p>

<p><b>Parson Trulliber</b>, a rude, vulgar, country clergyman, devoted to agricultural
pursuits; the race is most probably now extinct. From the
pig-feeding and pig-headed parson in <i>Joseph Andrews</i>.</p>

<p><b>Parson’s nose</b>, the hind part of a goose&mdash;a savoury mouthful. Sometimes
called the <span class="smcap">Pope’s nose</span>.</p>

<p><b>Part</b>, to pay, restore, or give up; “he’s a right un, he is; I know’d he’d
<span class="smcap lowercase">PART</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, he is a liberal (or punctual) person, and pays his debts, or
bestows gratuities. The term is in general use in sporting circles, and
is very commonly employed when speaking of the settlement of bets
after a race. It is probably derived from the very common reference to
stingy people, who are described as not liking to <span class="smcap lowercase">PART</span> with their money.</p>

<p><b>Parter</b>, a free, liberal person. Sometimes called a “good <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTER</span>.”
Any one who looks twice at his money, or who doesn’t pay it at all, is
called a “bad <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTER</span>.”</p>

<div><p><b>Party</b>, a person&mdash;term in very general use, similar in application to the
German pronoun, <span class="smcap lowercase">MAN</span>, a person, people; “where’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTY</span> as
’ad a’ orter be lookin’ after this ’ere ’oss?” policeman’s inquiry of the
wrong cabman; “old <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTY</span>,” an elderly person. The term is said
to have arisen in our old justice courts, where, to save “his worship”
and the clerk of the court any trouble in exercising their memories with
the names of the different plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses, the
word <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTY</span> was generally employed. Dean Alford remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The word <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTY</span> for a man is especially offensive. Strange to say, the use is
not altogether modern. It occurs in the English version of the Apocryphal
book of Tobit, vi. 7. ‘If an evil spirit trouble any, one must make a smoke
thereof before the man or the woman, and the <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTY</span> shall be no more vexed.’”</p></div>

<p>In Shakspeare we find the term:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Stephano.</i> How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTY</span>?”&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>, iii. 2.</p></div>

<p>This is not the only instance of the word being used by the immortal
bard. “I once heard,” said the Dean just quoted, “a venerable dignitary
pointed out by a railway porter as an old <span class="smcap lowercase">PARTY</span> in a shovel.”
The last word is the vulgar term applied to the peculiar hat worn by
clerical dignitaries.</p>
</div>


<p><b>Pash</b>, to strike; now corrupted to <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bash">BASH</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Paste</b>, to beat, to thrash vigorously.</p>

<p><b>Pasteboard</b>, a visiting card; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">PASTEBOARD</span> a person,” to drop a card
at an absent person’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="Paste-horn"></a>Paste-horn</b>, the nose. Shoemakers nickname any shopmate with a
large nose “old <span class="smcap lowercase">PASTE-HORN</span>,” from the shape of the horn in which
they keep their paste.</p>

<p><b>Pasty</b>, a bookbinder.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Patch.</b> This old English term of reproach, long obsolete in polite language,
may yet occasionally be heard in sentences like these:&mdash;“Why,
he’s not a <span class="smcap lowercase">PATCH</span> upon him,” <i>i.e.</i>, he is not to be compared with him;
“one’s not a <span class="smcap lowercase">PATCH</span> on the other,” &amp;c. Shakspeare uses the word in
the sense of a paltry fellow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What a pied ninny’s this? thou scurvy <span class="smcap lowercase">PATCH</span>!”</p></div>

<p>In old English <span class="smcap lowercase">PATCH</span> meant a fool, a wearer of patched clothes of
motley.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Patent coats</b>, the first coat, with the pockets inside the skirt, were so
termed.</p>

<p><b>Patter</b>, a speech or discourse, a pompous street oration, a judge’s summing
up, a trial. Ancient word for muttering. Probably from the
<i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PATERNOSTER</span>, or Lord’s Prayer. This was said, before the
Reformation, in a “low voice” by the priest, until he came to “and
lead us not into temptation,” to which the choir responded, “but
deliver us from evil.” In the reformed Prayer Book this was altered,
and the Lord’s Prayer directed to be said “with a <i>loud voice</i>.”
Dr. Pusey takes this view of the derivation in his <i>Letter to the Bishop
of London</i>, p. 78, 1851. Scott uses the word twice, in <i>Ivanhoe</i> and
the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>.</p>

<p><b>Patter</b>, to talk. <span class="smcap">Patter flash</span>, to speak the language of thieves, talk
cant.</p>

<p><b>Patteran</b>, a gipsy trail, made by throwing down a handful of grass occasionally,
especially where they have turned off from the main road.</p>

<p><b>Patter-crib</b>, a flash house.</p>

<p><b><a id="Patterer"></a>Patterer</b>, one of a race now nearly defunct, who cried last dying
speeches, &amp;c., in the streets. The term is also applied to those who
help off their wares by long harangues in the public thoroughfares.
These men, to use their own term, “are the aristocracy of the street
sellers,” and despise the costermongers for their ignorance, boasting
that they live by their intellect, which, as they do not live wonderfully
well, is no particularly wise boast.</p>

<p><b>Pattern</b>, a common vulgar phrase for “patent.”</p>

<p><b>Paul Pry</b>, an inquisitive person. From the well-known comedy.</p>

<p><b>Paw</b>, the hand. <span class="smcap">Paw-cases</span>, gloves. Boots are in some parts of Ireland
called “gloves for the feet.”</p>

<p><b>Pay</b>, to beat a person, or “serve him out.” Originally a nautical term,
meaning to stop the seams of a vessel with pitch (<i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">POIX</span>);
“here’s the d‑‑‑‑l to <span class="smcap lowercase">PAY</span>, and no pitch hot,” said when any catastrophe
occurs which there is no means of averting; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">PAY</span> over face
and eyes, as the cat did the monkey;” “to <span class="smcap lowercase">PAY</span> through the nose,” to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
give a ridiculous price,&mdash;an expressive phrase of which no one seems
to know the origin. Shakspeare uses <span class="smcap lowercase">PAY</span> in the sense of to beat or
thrash.</p>

<p><b>Pay</b>, to deliver. “<span class="smcap">Pay</span> that letter to Mr. So-and-so” is a very common
direction to a Chinese servant.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

<p><b>Pay-away</b>, “go on with your story, or discourse.” From the nautical
phrase <span class="smcap lowercase">PAY-AWAY</span>, meaning to allow a rope to run out of a vessel.
When the hearer considers the story quite long enough, he, carrying
out the same metaphor, exclaims “hold on.”</p>

<p><b>Peach</b>, an informer against omnibus conductors and drivers, one especially
hired by the proprietors to count passengers and stoppages. The
term is in frequent use amongst omnibus-men. This is about the only
instance known of the verb being used as a substantive.</p>

<p><b>Peach</b>, to inform against or betray. Webster states that the word “impeach”
is now mostly used, and that <span class="smcap lowercase">PEACH</span> is confined principally to
the conversation of thieves and the lower orders. The word was originally
“impeach,” though it was never until lately used in the same way
as its abridgment.</p>

<p><b>Peacock horse</b>, amongst undertakers, is one with a showy tail and
mane, which holds its head up well. <span class="smcap">Peacocky</span> refers to an objectionable
high action among racehorses.</p>

<p><b>Peaking</b>, remnants of cloth. Term amongst drapers and cloth warehousemen.</p>

<p><b>Peaky</b>, sickly, delicate.</p>

<p><b>Pec</b>, a term used by the Eton boys for money, an abbreviation, of course,
of the <i>Latin</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">PECUNIA</span>.</p>

<p><b>Peck</b>, food; “<span class="smcap lowercase">PECK</span> and boose,” meat and drink.&mdash;<i>Lincolnshire.</i> <i>Ancient
Cant</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PEK</span>, meat.</p>

<p><b>Peck</b>, to eat voraciously. A hearty eater is generally called “a rare
<span class="smcap lowercase">PECKER</span>.” Originally <span class="smcap lowercase">PECK</span> was to eat delicately, “but we have
changed all that now.”</p>

<p><b>Peck-alley</b>, the throat.</p>

<p><b>Pecker</b>, “keep your <span class="smcap lowercase">PECKER</span> up,” <i>i.e.</i>, don’t get down in the mouth,&mdash;literally,
keep your beak or head well up, “never say die!”</p>

<p><b>Peckham</b>, a facetious usage of the name of this district, implying a
dinner; “all holiday at <span class="smcap">Peckham</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, nothing to eat.</p>

<p><b>Peeler</b>, a policeman; so called from Sir Robert Peel (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bobby">BOBBY</a></span>); properly

Police, the former force having been established by Sir Robert Peel.</p>

<p><b>Peepers</b>, eyes; “painted <span class="smcap lowercase">PEEPERS</span>,” eyes bruised or blackened from a
blow.&mdash;<i>Pugilistic.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Peg"></a>Peg</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">PEG</span> away,” to strike, run, or drive away; “<span class="smcap lowercase">PEG</span> a hack,” to
drive a cab; “to take him down a <span class="smcap lowercase">PEG</span> or two,” to check an arrogant
or conceited person,&mdash;possibly derived from the use of <span class="smcap lowercase">PEG</span> tankards.
<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Pin">PIN</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Peg</b>, to drink frequently; generally used in reference to devotees of

in Singapore.</p>

<p><b>Pencil-fever</b>, a supposititious disease among racehorses, the preliminary
symptoms of which show that an animal has been pretty considerably
“milked.” <span class="smcap">Pencil-fever</span> sets in when, despite the efforts of the
“marketeers,” a horse can no longer be kept at a short price in the
lists, through his actual condition being discovered, and when every
layer of odds is anxious to write his name down. This disorder is also
called “milk-fever,” “market-fever,” and other suggestive names.</p>

<p><b>Penny-a-liner</b>, a contributor of local news, accidents, fires, and scandals
to a newspaper; a man not regularly “on the paper;” one who
is popularly believed to be paid for each contribution at the rate of a
penny a line, and whose interest is, therefore, that his articles should
be stuffed with fine words and long sentences. This wonderful
person, to whom so much is daily attributed, is now generally called a
<span class="smcap lowercase">LINER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Penny dreadfuls</b>, an expressive term for those penny publications
which depend more upon sensationalism than upon merit, artistic or
literary, for success.</p>

<p><b><a id="Penny_gaff"></a>Penny gaff</b>, a shop turned into a temporary theatre (admission one
penny), at which dancing and singing take place every night. Sometimes
rude pictures of the performers are arranged outside to give the
front a gaudy and attractive look, and at night-time coloured lamps and
transparencies are displayed to draw an audience. Zest is given to these
entertainments by the fact that now and again the police make raids upon
the houses, and carry off both actors and spectators. These places are
also called “dukeys,” for no reason that can be discovered. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Gaff">GAFF</a></span>.</p>

miserable earnings of a prostitute. There is an unmentionable prefix
to the word <span class="smcap">Pensioner</span>. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Ponce">Ponce</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Pepper</b>, to thrash, or strike.&mdash;<i>Pugilistic</i>, but used by Shakspeare.&mdash;<i>Eastern

Gallery in Trafalgar Square. The name was first given by a wag, in
allusion to the cupolas erected by Wilkins, the architect, upon the roof,
which, from their form and awkward appearance, at a distance suggest
to the stranger the fact of their being enlarged <span class="smcap lowercase">PEPPER-BOXES</span>.

<p><b>Perkin</b>, beer. Dandy or affected shortening of the widely-known firm,
Barclay and Perkins.</p>

<p><b>Perpendicular</b>, a lunch taken standing-up at a tavern bar. It is usual
to call it lunch, often as the <span class="smcap lowercase">PERPENDICULAR</span> may take the place of
dinner.</p>

<p><b>Persuaders</b>, spurs.</p>

<p><b>Pesky</b>, an intensitive expression, implying annoyance; as, “A <span class="smcap lowercase">PESKY</span>,
troublesome fellow.” Corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">PESTILENT</span>; or, <i>Irish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PEASGACH</span>,
rough, rugged. <span class="smcap">Pesky</span> has now become more American than English.
<i>Pesky Ike</i> is the name of a popular American drama.</p>

<p><b>Peter</b>, a partridge.&mdash;<i>Poacher’s term.</i></p>

tankard. “Let me have my beer in the <span class="smcap lowercase">PEWTER</span>,” is a common
request to waiters, made by “City” men, and others who affect habits
of rude health. The pots for which rowing men contend are often
called <span class="smcap lowercase">PEWTERS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Philadelphia-lawyer</b>, a Transatlantic limb of the law considered to be
the very acme of acuteness. Sailors relate many stories of his artful
abilities, none, however, short enough to find a place here. The
phrase, “Enough to puzzle a <span class="smcap">Philadelphia-lawyer</span>,” means,
enough to puzzle the sharpest man in the world.</p>

<p><b>Philander</b>, to ramble on incoherently; to write discursively and weakly.</p>

<p><b>Philip</b>, a policeman. The word is loudly given as a signal that the police
are approaching.</p>

<p><b>Philiper</b>, a thief’s accomplice, one who stands by and looks out for the
police while the others commit a robbery, and who calls out “Philip!”
when any one approaches.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Philistine</b>, a policeman. The German students call all townspeople not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

says, mournfully, in one of the Burschenlieder&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Muss selber nun <span class="smcap">Philister</span> sein!”<br /></span>

set opposed to one’s own. Society is supposed to regard all outside
its bounds as belonging to the <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> world. Bohemians regard
all cleanly, orderly people who conform to conventionality as <span class="smcap">Philistines</span>.</p>

<p><b>Picaroon</b>, a pirate or buccaneer originally; now an ordinary thief.</p>

<p><b>Piccadilly butchers</b>, a satirical name applied by the crowd to the
regiment of Horse Guards, known as the “Royal Blues,” from their
savage onslaught upon the crowd on the occasion of the arrest of Sir
Francis Burdett at his house in Piccadilly, by order of the Speaker of
the House of Commons. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Cheesemongers">Cheesemongers</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Piccadilly weepers</b>, long carefully combed-out whiskers of the
Dundreary fashion.</p>

<p><b>Pick</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">PICK</span> oneself up,” to recover after a beating or illness, sometimes
varied to “<span class="smcap lowercase">PICK</span> up one’s crumbs;” “to <span class="smcap lowercase">PICK</span> a man up,” “to

<p><b>Pickaninny</b>, a young child is thus styled by the West Indian negroes.
The word is now completely naturalized among sailors and water-side
people in England.</p>

<p><b>Pickers</b>, the hands.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Pickle</b>, a miserable or comical position; “he is in a sad <span class="smcap lowercase">PICKLE</span>,” said of
any one who has fallen into the gutter, or got besmeared. “A <span class="smcap lowercase">PICKLE</span>
herring,” a comical fellow, a merry-andrew.&mdash;<i>Old.</i> Also, a mischievous
boy; “what a <span class="smcap lowercase">PICKLE</span> he is, to be sure!” Derived from his
always getting into a <span class="smcap lowercase">PICKLE</span>, or mess.</p>

<p><b>Pickles!</b> gammon; also a jeering and insulting exclamation.</p>

<p><b>Pick-me-up</b>, a revivifying drink taken after a debauch; a tonic.</p>

<p><b>Piece</b>, a contemptuous term for a woman; a strumpet.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i> Not
always objectionable nowadays. A “barber’s clerk” does not object to
hear his sweetheart or wife called “a nice <span class="smcap lowercase">PIECE</span>;” and gentlemen of
the counter-jumping fraternity describe their “young ladies” as “nice
<span class="smcap lowercase">PIECES</span> of goods.”</p>

<p><b>Pieman.</b> In tossing, the man who cries is called the <span class="smcap lowercase">PIEMAN</span>. In the
old days when the itinerant <span class="smcap lowercase">PIEMAN’S</span> duty was to toss or sell, and his
call was, “Hot pies, toss or buy, toss or buy,” he was always supposed
to be entitled to the cry, the intending eater “skying the copper.”
An active and efficient police have, however, improved tossing&mdash;so far,
at all events, as <span class="smcap lowercase">PIEMEN</span> and poor people are concerned&mdash;off the face
of the earth, and gaming of all descriptions is now a luxury confined

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pig</b>, a policeman; an informer. The word is now almost exclusively
applied by London thieves to a plain-clothes man, or a “nose.”</p>

<p><b>Pig</b>, a pressman in a printing office. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Donkey">DONKEY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Pig</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SOW’S BABY</span>, a sixpence.</p>

<p><b>Pig</b>, to live in a crowded, filthy manner. The lower orders of Irish are
said to <span class="smcap lowercase">PIG</span> together. A suggestive, if not elegant, expression.</p>

<p><b>Pig and Tinder-box</b>, the vulgar rendering of the well-known tavern
sign, “Elephant and Castle.”</p>

<p><b>Pigeon</b>, a gullible or soft person. The <i>French</i> cant, or <i>Argot</i>, has the
word <span class="smcap lowercase">PIGEON</span>, dupe&mdash;“<span class="smcap lowercase">PECHON, PESCHON DE RUBY</span>, apprenti gueux,
enfant (sans doute dérobé)”. The vagabonds and brigands of Spain
also used the word in their <i>Germania</i>, or robbers’ language, <span class="smcap lowercase">PALOMO</span>
(<span class="smcap lowercase">PIGEON</span>), ignorant, simple. In the sporting world sharps and flats
are often called “rooks and <span class="smcap lowercase">PIGEONS</span>” respectively&mdash;sometimes
“spiders and flies.”</p>

<p><b>Pigeon</b>, business, simply the Chinese pronunciation of the English word.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

<p><b>Pigeon-English</b>, the English spoken by the natives of Canton and
other parts of China.</p>

<p><b>Pig-headed</b>, obstinate.</p>

<p><b>Pig’s eye</b>, the ace of diamonds in cards.</p>

<p><b>Pig’s whisper</b>, a low or inaudible whisper; also a short space of time,
synonymous with “cockstride,” <i>i.e.</i>, cock’s tread.</p>

<p><b>Pike</b>, a turnpike; “to bilk a <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKE</span>,” to cheat the keeper of the toll-gate.
Mr. Tony Weller makes many amusing remarks on <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKES</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKE</span>-keepers.
Since the first edition of this work was published, <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKES</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKE</span>-keepers have departed from amongst us, so far as London
and its immediate vicinity are concerned.</p>

<p><b>Pike</b>, to run, to be off with speed.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Pike it</b>, is said as a hasty and contemptuous, if not angry, dismissal,
“if you don’t like it, take a short stick and <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKE</span> it.” This is but a

<p><b>Pikey</b>, a tramp or gipsy. A <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKEY</span>-cart is in various parts of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
one of those habitable vehicles suggestive of a wandering life. Possibly
the term has reference to one who constantly uses the <span class="smcap lowercase">PIKE</span>, or turnpike
road.</p>

<p><b>Pile</b>, a sum of money; generally the whole of a man’s private means. A
term originally peculiar to Californian miners, in reference to their
accumulated dust and nuggets. American gamblers speak of “putting
all the <span class="smcap lowercase">PILE</span> on” when they fancy anything very much. “To go the

<p><b>Pill</b>, a doctor.&mdash;<i>Military.</i> <span class="smcap">Pill-driver</span>, a peddling apothecary.</p>

<p><b>Pill</b>, to blackball a man at a club. Sometimes a man who is blackballed

<p><b>Pill-box</b>, a doctor’s carriage.</p>

<p><b><a id="Pin"></a>Pin</b>, “to put in the <span class="smcap lowercase">PIN</span>,” to refrain from drinking. From the ancient
peg tankard, which was furnished with a row of <span class="smcap lowercase">PINS</span>, or pegs, to regulate
the amount which each person was to drink. Drunken people
are often requested to “put in the <span class="smcap lowercase">PIN</span>,” from some remote connexion
between their unsteadiness and that of a carriage wheel which has lost
its linch-<span class="smcap lowercase">PIN</span>. The popular cry, “Put in the <span class="smcap lowercase">PIN</span>,” can have no connexion
with the drinking <span class="smcap lowercase">PIN</span> or peg now, whatever it may originally

<p><span class="smcap">Pinchbeck</span> was an inferior metal, compounded of copper and zinc, to

its name from a Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinchbeck</span>, a well-known London tradesman,
who manufactured watches, buckles, and other articles out of it.
<span class="smcap">Pinchbeck</span> first obtained his notoriety by the invention of an ingenious
candle-snuffers, which the author of <i>The Heroic Epistle to Sir
William Chambers</i> made the vehicle of a facetious Ode that went
through eight editions. The title of this <i>jeu d’esprit</i> ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Pink</b>, the acme of perfection. The scarlet garb worn in the hunting-field.</p>

<p><b>Pink</b>, to stab, or pierce. In the days of rapier-wearing a professed
duellist was said to be “a regular <span class="smcap lowercase">PINKER</span> and driller.”</p>

<p><b>Pinnel</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">PENNEL</span>,&mdash;corruption of penal servitude. As, “four-year

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pinner-up</b>, a seller of old songs, pinned against a wall or framed
canvas. Formerly many of these street salesmen carried on their little
“paper trade” in London. There are but one or two now left.</p>

<p><b>Pins</b>, legs.</p>

<p><b>Pipe</b>, to follow or dog a person; to watch, to notice.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Pipe</b>, to shed tears, or bewail; “<span class="smcap lowercase">PIPE</span> one’s eye.”&mdash;<i>Sea term.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Metaphor from the boatswain’s pipe, which calls to duty.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Pipe</b>, “to put one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">PIPE</span> out,” to traverse his plans, “to take a rise”
out of him. When any one meets with a rebuff or a sharp answer, he
is often told to “put that in his <span class="smcap lowercase">PIPE</span> and smoke it,” <i>i.e.</i>, to digest it

<p><b>Piper</b>, a person employed by an omnibus proprietor to act as a spy on
the conductor.</p>

<p><b>Piper</b>, a broken-winded hack horse.</p>

<p><b>Pipkin</b>, the stomach,&mdash;properly, an earthen round-bottomed pot&mdash;<i>Norwich.</i></p>

<p><b>Pips</b>, the marks, no matter of what suit, on playing cards. The ace is
often called “single <span class="smcap lowercase">PIP</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Pit</b>, a breast-pocket.</p>

<p><b>Pitch</b>, a fixed locality where a patterer can hold forth to a gaping multitude
for at least some few minutes continuously; “to do a <span class="smcap lowercase">PITCH</span> in
the drag,” to perform in the street. An itinerant is said to “make a
<span class="smcap lowercase">PITCH</span>” whenever he attempts to do any business.</p>

<p><b>Pitch</b>, to utter base coin. Smashers are known to themselves and their
friends, the rest of the dangerous classes, as “snide <span class="smcap lowercase">PITCHERS</span>.” The
confederacy is divided into makers, buyers, holders, and pitchers.
The maker probably never sees the actual passers of base money, the
buyer being generally the intercommunicating medium. The holder
is generally a man who carries the bulk of the “snides,” and waits
about; while the pitcher, often a woman&mdash;indeed, more often than
not&mdash;runs the actual risk.</p>

<p><b>Pitch</b>, to go to bed for less than the ordinary period. Journeymen
bakers, and others whose work is disjointed, call any short interval of
sleep a <span class="smcap lowercase">PITCH</span>. Probably from the action.</p>

<p><b>Pitch into</b>, to fight; “<span class="smcap lowercase">PITCH INTO</span> him, Bill,” <i>i.e.</i>, give him a thrashing.</p>

<p><b>Pitch the fork</b>, to tell a pitiful tale.</p>

<p><b>Pitch the nob</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Prick_the_garter">PRICK THE GARTER</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Place</b>, to name the first three horses in a race. This is the duty of the
judge, who sees nothing of the race but the finish. Sometimes an
official will place more than the first three, but this in no way interferes
with the meaning of the word as generally received. To run
“nowhere” is to be unplaced.</p>

<p><b><a id="Place"></a>Place</b>, first, second, or third position in a race. Sometimes a <span class="smcap lowercase">PLACE</span> is
called a “situation” or a “shop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Plant</b>, a dodge, a preconcerted swindle; a position in the street to sell
from. All bearings-up, bonnetings, and such like arrangements, are
the results of preconcerted schemes or <span class="smcap lowercase">PLANTS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Plant</b>, to mark a person out for plunder or robbery; to conceal or hide
money, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i> In the sense of conceal, there is a similar
word in <i>Argot</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PLANQUER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Plant</b>, a hidden store of money or variables. To “spring a <span class="smcap lowercase">PLANT</span>” is
to unearth another person’s hoard.</p>

<p><b>Platform</b>, a standpoint in an argument, a statement of political or general
opinion. “Home rule’s my <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATFORM</span>!” Originally <i>American</i>,
but now general.</p>

<p><b>Play</b>, to strike for higher wages, to be out of work.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b>Plebs</b>, a term used to stigmatize a tradesman’s son at Westminster
School. <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PLEBS</span>, the vulgar.</p>

<p><b>Plough.</b> To be <span class="smcap lowercase">PLOUGHED</span> is to fail to pass an examination. About
twenty years ago “pluck,” the word then used, began to be superseded
by <span class="smcap lowercase">PLOUGH</span>. It is said to have arisen from a man who could not
supply the examiner with any quotation from Scripture, until at last
he blurted out, “And the ploughers ploughed on my back, and made
long furrows.”&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Ploughed</b>, drunk.</p>

<p><b>Pluck</b>, the heart, liver, and lungs of an animal,&mdash;all that is <span class="smcap lowercase">PLUCKED</span>
away in connexion with the windpipe, from the chest of a sheep or
hog.</p>

<p><b>Pluck</b>, to turn back at a University examination. The supposed origin
of <span class="smcap lowercase">PLUCK</span> is, that when, on degree day, the proctor, after having read
the name of a candidate for a degree, walks down the hall and back,
it is to give any creditor the opportunity of plucking his sleeve, and
informing him of the candidate’s being in debt.</p>

<p><b>Pluck</b>, courage, valour, stoutness. <i>See following.</i></p>

<p><b>Plucked un</b>, a stout or brave fellow; “he’s a rare <span class="smcap lowercase">PLUCKED UN</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>,
he dares face anything.</p>

<p>During the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny <span class="smcap lowercase">PLUCKY</span>, signifying
courageous, became a favourite term even among ladies; and the term
British <span class="smcap lowercase">PLUCK</span> will probably live&mdash;slangy as is its origin&mdash;as long as
the language into which it has been adopted, for the history of the
deeds with which it is associated can never die, while, indeed, a history
remains to this country. The word met with great disfavour at first
from the “genteel,” but of course they followed when aristocracy
deigned to use it.</p>

first Reform Bill, whose qualification consisted in being a housekeeper,&mdash;to
establish which it was only necessary to boil a pot within the
limits of the borough, by the aid of any temporary erection. This
implied that he was able to provide for himself, and not necessitated
to apply for parochial relief. Honiton, Tregoney, Ilchester, Old
Sarum, &amp;c., had this privilege before the passing of the first Reform
Bill. Also, a scullion.</p>

<p><b>Potato-trap</b>, the mouth.&mdash;Originally a Hibernicism.</p>

<p><b>Potheen</b>, whisky made in an illicit still, once a favourite drink in Ireland,
now almost unattainable. People resident in England who read

<p><b>Potter</b>, to meddle without much judgment. Application various. A
gentleman may describe himself as “<span class="smcap lowercase">POTTERING</span> about in his garden,”
and think the phrase pleasant. The gardener, who has to do the work
all over again, may, however, use the word in quite a different sense.</p>

<p><b>Power</b>, a large quantity; “a <span class="smcap lowercase">POWER</span> of money.”&mdash;<i>Irish</i> at first, but
now general.</p>

<p><b>Pow-wow</b>, a conference. Originally an Indian term.</p>

<p><b>Prad</b>, a horse. <span class="smcap">Prad-napping</span> was horse-stealing. Both these terms

little of that,” <i>i.e.</i>, a very little indeed; a <span class="smcap lowercase">PRECIOUS</span> humbug, rascal,
&amp;c., <i>i.e.</i>, an eminent one.</p>

<p><b><a id="Pretty_horsebreakers"></a>Pretty horsebreakers</b>, a phrase adopted some years back, in deference
to common squeamishness, to denote the <i>demi-monde</i>, who dress so
well and ride so daintily. Really, pretty heartbreakers.</p>

<p><b>Prial</b>, a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">PAIR-ROYAL</span>, a term at the game of cribbage,
meaning three cards of a similar description. Often used metaphorically
for three persons or things of a kind. <span class="smcap">Double-prial</span>, a corruption
of <span class="smcap lowercase">DOUBLE PAIR-ROYAL</span>, means four cards, persons, or things of a
similar description.</p>

<p><b><a id="Prick_the_garter"></a>Prick the garter</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">PITCH THE NOB</span>, a gambling and cheating
game common at fairs, and generally practised by thimble-riggers. It
consists of a <span class="smcap lowercase">GARTER</span> or a piece of list doubled, and then folded up
tight. The bet is made upon your asserting that you can, with a pin,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRICK</span> the point at which the garter is doubled. The garter is then
unfolded, and nine times out of ten you will find that you have been
deceived, and that one of the false folds has been pricked. The owner
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">GARTER</span> holds the ends tightly with one hand, and there is little
doubt that he can make the “flat” lose and the “bonnet” win at
pleasure. This was, doubtless, originally a gipsy game, and we are
informed by Brand that it was much practised by the gipsies in the
time of Shakspeare. In those days it was termed <span class="smcap lowercase">PRICKING AT THE
BELT</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">FAST AND LOOSE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Prig</b>, a thief. Used by Addison in the sense of a coxcomb.&mdash;<i>Ancient
Cant</i>, probably from the <i>Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PRICC-AN</span>, to filch, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i>
<span class="smcap">Prig</span>, to steal or rob. <span class="smcap">Prigging</span>, thieving. In Scotland the term
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRIG</span> is used in a different sense from what it is in England. In
Glasgow, or at Aberdeen, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">PRIG</span> a salmon” would be to cheapen
it, or seek for an abatement in the price. A story is told of two
Scotchmen, visitors to London, who got into sad trouble a few years
ago by announcing their intention of “<span class="smcap lowercase">PRIGGING</span> a hat” which they
had espied in a fashionable manufacturer’s window, and which one of
them thought he would like to possess.</p>

<p><b>Prig</b>, a conceited, stuck-up, over-knowing person; one who appropriates

University.</i></p>

<p><b>Proctorized</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TO BE</span>, to be stopped by the Proctor, and told to call on
him.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Prog</b>, meat, food, &amp;c. Johnson calls it “a low word.” He was fond of
“prog,” however.</p>

<p><b>Proof</b>, the best ale at Magdalen College, Oxford.</p>

<p><b>Prop</b>, a blow. As, “a <span class="smcap lowercase">PROP</span> on the nose,”&mdash;more street slang than
pugilistic.</p>

<p><b>Prop</b>, a scarf pin.</p>

<p><b>Prop-nailer</b>, a man who “sneaks,” or rather snatches, pins from gentlemen’s
scarves.</p>

<p><b>Proper</b>, very, exceedingly, sometimes used ironically; “you are a <span class="smcap lowercase">PROPER</span>
nice fellow,” meaning a great scamp. A “<span class="smcap lowercase">PROPER</span> man” generally
means a perfect man, as far as can be known.</p>

<p><b>Props</b>, crutches.</p>

<p><b>Props</b>, stage properties.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Pros</b>, a water-closet. Abbreviated form of πρὸς τινα τόπον. Some say,
πρὸς τον τόπον.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Pross</b>, to break in or instruct a stage-infatuated youth. Also, to
spunge upon a comrade or stranger for drink. In this latter capacity
the word is in connexion with prostitute, a <span class="smcap lowercase">PROSSER</span> being considered
a most degraded being, and the word being supposed by many to represent
a man who lives on a woman’s prostitution.</p>

<p><b>Psalm-smiter</b>, a “Ranter,” one who sings at a conventicle. <i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Brisket-Beater">BRISKET-BEATER</a></span>.</p>

preachers, and harangue in the open air to attract a crowd for their

<div>
<p><b>Puff</b>, to blow up, or swell with praise; declared by a writer in the <i>Weekly
Register</i>, as far back as 1732, to be illegitimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Puff</span> has become a cant word, signifying the applause set forth by writers, &amp;c.
to increase the reputation and sale of a book, and is an excellent stratagem to
excite the curiosity of gentle readers.”</p></div>

<p>Lord Bacon, however, used the word in a similar sense a century
before. Sheridan also seems to have remembered the use of the word,
<i>vide</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Puff</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Pug</b>, a fighting man’s idea of the contracted word to be produced from
pugilist.</p>

<p><b>Pull</b>, an advantage, or hold upon another; “I’ve the <span class="smcap lowercase">PULL</span> over (or of)
you,” <i>i.e.</i>, you are in my power&mdash;perhaps an oblique allusion to the
judicial sense. See the following.</p>

<p><b>Pull</b>, to have one apprehended; “to be <span class="smcap lowercase">PULLED</span> up,” or more recently
“to be <span class="smcap lowercase">PULLED</span>” only, to be taken before a magistrate. The police
are constantly “pulling” loitering, furiously driving, or drunken cabmen.</p>

<p><b>Punkah</b>, a fan, usually a fan of very large size, worked with a string, and
used to ventilate rooms.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Punt</b>, to gamble; <span class="smcap lowercase">PUNTING-SHOP</span>, a gambling-house. Common in

for “chicken stakes.” <span class="smcap">Punt</span> means now in the sporting world to back

<p><b>Pup and ringer</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, the “Dog and Bell,” the sign of a flash public-house.</p>

<p><b>Pussey-cats</b>, corruption of Puseyites, a name constantly, but improperly,
given to the Tractarian party in the Church, from the
Oxford Regius Professor of Hebrew, who by no means approved of
the Romanizing tendencies of some of its leaders. The name still
sticks, however, to this day.</p>

<p><b>Put</b>, a game at cards, once fashionable, but now played among thieves
and costermongers only.</p>

<p><b>Put</b>, an obsolete slang term representing the modern “bloke” or “cove.”
It was generally applied to elderly persons.</p>

<p><b>Put on</b>, to promise another money or valuables in the event of an anticipated
success. “You’re <span class="smcap lowercase">ON</span> a quid if Kaiser wins,” might often have
been heard before last St. Leger. Many hangers-on of the turf live
almost entirely by what they are <span class="smcap lowercase">PUT ON</span>, by bookmakers and backers
for whom they do odd work.</p>

<p><b>Put that in your pipe and smoke it</b>, said of a blow or repartee,
and equivalent to take that and think over it, or digest it, or let it be
a warning to you.</p>

<p><b>Put the pot on</b>, to put too much money upon one horse.&mdash;<i>Sporting.</i></p>

<p><b>Put upon</b>, cheated, victimized, oppressed.</p>

<p><b>Putter up</b>, a man who travels about for the purpose of obtaining information
useful to professional burglars. A man of this description
will assume many characters, sometimes ingratiating himself with the
master of a house, sometimes with the servants, but all to one end, that

being simply to obtain full particulars as to how, when, and where, for
which he receives his full share of the “swag.”</p>

<p><b>Puttun</b>, regiment.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Pyah</b>, weak, useless, paltry. This word, much in use among sailors, is
evidently derived from the Indian term <span class="smcap lowercase">PARIAH</span>, signifying the lowest
caste of Hindoos. Thus the Pariah dogs in India are termed <span class="smcap lowercase">PYAH</span>
dogs; and the Pariah descendants of the old Portuguese settlers are
called <span class="smcap lowercase">PYAH</span> Portuguese. Sailors term the natives of St. Helena&mdash;a

be given here. It illustrates, like “<a href="#Hocus_pocus">hocus-pocus</a>,” and other compound
colloquialisms, the singular origin of slang expressions. <span class="smcap">Quandary</span>,
a dilemma, a doubt, a difficulty, is from the French, <span class="smcap lowercase">QU’EN DIRAI-JE</span>?&mdash;<i>Skinner.</i></p>

<p><b>Quartereen</b>, a farthing.&mdash;<i>Gibraltar term.</i> <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">QUATTRINO</span>.</p>

<p><b>Quaver</b>, a musician.</p>

<p><b>Queen Bess</b>, the Queen of Clubs,&mdash;perhaps because that queen, history
says, was of a swarthy complexion.&mdash;<i>North Hants.</i> <i>See Gentleman’s
Magazine for 1791</i>, p. 141.</p>

<p><b>Queen’s tobacco-pipe</b>, the kiln in which all contraband tobacco
seized by the Custom-house officers is burned.</p>

<p><b><a id="Queer"></a>Queer</b>, an old cant word, once in continual use as a prefix, signifying
base, roguish, or worthless,&mdash;the opposite of <span class="smcap lowercase">RUM</span>, which signified
good and genuine. <span class="smcap">Queer</span>, in all probability, is immediately derived
from the cant language. It has been mooted that it came into use from
a <i>quære</i> (?) being set before a man’s name; but it is more than probable
that it was brought into this country, by the gipsies, from Germany,
where <span class="smcap lowercase">QUER</span> signifies “cross” or “crooked.” At all events it is
believed to have been first used in England as a cant word.</p>

<p><b><a id="Queer_cuffen"></a>Queer cuffen</b>, a justice of the peace, or magistrate,&mdash;a very ancient
term, mentioned in the earliest slang dictionary. In this sense, as well
as in that of the verb just given, the term is evidently derived from
<i>quæro</i>, to inquire, to question. Quiz and <i>quis?</i> have also an
undoubted connexion.</p>

<p><b>Quid</b>, a small piece of tobacco&mdash;one mouthful. <i>Quid est hoc?</i> asked one,
tapping the swelled cheek of another; <i>Hoc est quid</i>, promptly replied
the other, exhibiting at the same time a “chaw” of the weed. <span class="smcap">Cud</span>
is probably a corruption. Derivation, <i>O. F.</i>, or <i>Norman</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">QUIDER</span>, to
ruminate.</p>

<p><b>Quid-nunc</b>, an inquisitive person, always seeking for news. The words

<p><b>Quisi</b>, roguish, low, obscene.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

<p><b>Qui-tam</b>, a solicitor. <i>He who</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, “he who, as much for himself as for
the King,” seeks a conviction, the penalty for which goes half to the
informer and half to the Crown. The term would, therefore, with
greater propriety, be applied to a spy than to a solicitor.</p>

<p><b>Quiz</b>, a prying person, an odd fellow. Originally Oxford slang, but now

At Oxford, where it is spelt <span class="smcap lowercase">QUAD</span>, the word has its original signification.</p>

<p><b>Rook</b>, to cheat, to play “rook” to another’s “pigeon.”</p>

<p><b>Rook</b>, a clergyman, not only from his black attire, but also, perhaps,
from the old nursery favourite, the <i>History of Cock Robin</i>.</p>

<p><b>Rookery</b>, a low neighbourhood inhabited by dirty Irish and thieves&mdash;as
St. Giles’s <span class="smcap lowercase">ROOKERY</span>.&mdash;<i>Old.</i> In military slang that part of the

order.</p>

<p><b>Rooky</b>, rascally, rakish, scampish.</p>

<p><b>Roost</b>, synonymous with <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Perch">PERCH</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Rooster</b>, a cock, whether bantam, game, barndoor, or of any other kind.
This is an Americanism which obtains full currency on the other side
of the Atlantic, though its use would infer that hens do not roost. As
the outcome of transpontine delicacy it must, however, be respected.</p>

<p><b>Rooter</b>, anything good, or of a prime quality; “that is a <span class="smcap lowercase">ROOTER</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>,
a first-rate one of the sort.</p>

conversant with the minutiæ of metropolitan dodges, as regards both
the streets and the sporting world.</p>

<p><b>Roping</b>, the act of pulling or restraining a horse, by its rider, to prevent
its winning a race&mdash;a trick not unfrequently practised on the turf. Also
when a pedestrian or other athlete loses where he should have won,
according to his backer’s calculations, he is accused of <span class="smcap lowercase">ROPING</span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Rose"></a>Rose</b>, “under the rose” (frequently used in its <i>Latin</i> form, <i>sub rosâ</i>),
<i>i.e.</i>, under the obligation of silence and secrecy, of which the rose was
anciently an emblem, perhaps, as Sir Thomas Browne remarks, from
the closeness with which its petals are enfolded in the bud. The Rose
of Venus was given, says the classic legend, to Harpocrates, the God
of Silence, by Cupid, as a bribe to keep silent about the goddess’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
amours. It was commonly sculptured on the ceilings of banqueting
rooms, as a sign that what was said in free conversation there was not
afterwards to be divulged; and about 1526 was placed over the Roman
confessionals as an emblem of secrecy. The White Rose was also an

what accommodation “turns up,” without sighing for better.</p>

of <span class="smcap lowercase">RUFFIAN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Rouleau</b>, a packet of sovereigns.&mdash;<i>Gaming.</i></p>

<p><b>Round</b>, to tell tales, to <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Split">SPLIT</a></span>, which <i>see</i>; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">ROUND</span> on a man,” to
swear to him as being the person, &amp;c. Synonymous with <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Buff">BUFF</a></span>,
which <i>see</i>. Also to turn round upon and abuse or rate. Shakspeare
has <span class="smcap lowercase">ROUNDING</span>, whispering.</p>

<p><b>Round</b>, “<span class="smcap lowercase">ROUND</span> dealing,” honest trading; “<span class="smcap lowercase">ROUND</span> sum,” a large sum.

<div>
<p><b>Round</b> (in the language of the street), the beat or usual walk of a costermonger
to sell his stock. A term used by street folk generally.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Watchmen, sometimes they made their sallies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walk’d their <span class="smcap lowercase">ROUNDS</span> through streets and allies.”<br /></span>
</div>
<span class="sig"><i>Ned Ward’s Vulgus Britannicus</i>, 1710.<br /></span>

<p>The word “beat” has, so far as our modern guardians are concerned,
deposed “round.”</p>
</div>


<p><b>Round robin</b>, a petition, or paper of remonstrance, with the signatures
written in a circle,&mdash;to prevent the first signer, or ringleader, from
being discovered.</p>

<p><b>Round un</b>, an unblushingly given and well-proportioned lie. Sometimes
known as a “whacker.”</p>

<p><b>Roundabout</b>, a large swing with four compartments, each the size, and
very much the shape, of the body of a cart, capable of seating six or
eight boys and girls, erected in a high frame, and turned round by
men at a windlass. Fairs and merry-makings generally abound with
these swings. The frames take to pieces, and are carried in vans from
fair to fair by miserable horses.</p>

<p><b>Roundem</b>, a button.</p>

<p><b>Row</b>, “the <span class="smcap">Row</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, Paternoster Row. The notorious Holywell Street
is now called by its denizens “Bookseller’s Row.”</p>

<p><b>Row</b>, a noisy disturbance, tumult, or trouble. Originally Cambridge, now
universal. Seventy years ago it was written <span class="smcap lowercase">ROUE</span>, which would almost
indicate a French origin, from <i>roué</i>, a profligate or disturber of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
peace.&mdash;<i>Vide</i> George Parker’s <i>Life’s Painter</i>, 1789, p. 122. This is,
however, very unlikely, as the derivation of the French word shows.</p>

<p><b>Rowdy</b>, money. In America, a ruffian, a brawler, a “rough.” Rowdyism
is the state of being of New York roughs and loafers.</p>

<p><b>Rowdy-dow</b>, low, vulgar “not the <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Cheese">CHEESE</a></span>,” or thing.</p>

<p><b>Rub</b>, a quarrel or impediment; “there’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">RUB</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, that is the difficulty.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare
and L’Estrange.</i></p>

<p><b>Rubbed out</b>, dead,&mdash;a melancholy expression, of late frequently used in
fashionable novels. <span class="smcap">Rubbed out</span> is synonymous with <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Wipe-out">WIPED OUT</a></span>,
which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Rubber</b>, a term at whist, &amp;c., the best of three games.</p>

<p><b>Ruck</b>, the undistinguished crowd; “to come in with the <span class="smcap lowercase">RUCK</span>,” to

<p><b>Ruction</b>, an Irish row. A faction fight.</p>

<p><b>Ruggy</b>, fusty, frowsy.</p>

<p><b>Rule.</b> “To run the <span class="smcap lowercase">RULE</span> over,” is, among thieves, to try all a person’s
pockets quietly, as done by themselves, or to search any one thoroughly,
as at the police-station.</p>

<p><b>Rule the roast</b>, to be at the head of affairs, to be “cock of the walk.”</p>

<div>
<p><b>Rum</b>, like its opposite, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Queer">QUEER</a></span>, was formerly a much-used prefix, signifying
fine, good, gallant, or valuable; perhaps in some way connected
with <span class="smcap">Rome</span>. Nowadays it means indifferent, bad, or questionable,
and we often hear even persons in polite society use such a phrase as,
“What a <span class="smcap lowercase">RUM</span> fellow he is, to be sure,” in speaking of a man of singular
habits or appearance. The term, from its frequent use, long
since claimed a place in our dictionaries; but, with the exception of
Johnson, who says <span class="smcap lowercase">RUM</span>, a cant word for a clergyman(!), no lexicographer
has deigned to notice it.</p>

<p><b>Rumbumptious</b>, haughty, pugilistic.</p>

of the comfort of others.</p>

<p><b>Rumgumption</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">GUMPTION</span>, knowledge, capacity, capability,&mdash;hence,
<span class="smcap lowercase">RUMGUMPTIOUS</span>, knowing, wide-awake, forward, positive, pert,
blunt.</p>

<p><b>Rum-mizzler</b>, Seven Dials cant for a person who is clever at making his
escape, or getting out of a difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Rump</b>, to turn the back upon any one. A still more decided “cut direct”
than the “cold shoulder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Rumpus</b>, a noise, disturbance, a “row.”</p>

<p><b>Rum-slim</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">RUM SLING</span>, rum punch.</p>

<p><b>Rumy</b>, a good woman or girl.&mdash;<i>Gipsy Cant.</i> In the Continental <i>Gipsy</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">ROMI</span>, a woman, a wife, is the feminine of <span class="smcap lowercase">RO</span>, a man.</p>

<p><b>Run</b> (good or bad), the success or duration of a piece’s performance.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Run</b>, to comprehend, &amp;c.; “I don’t <span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span> to it,” <i>i.e.</i>, I can’t do it, I don’t
understand; also not money enough, as, “I should like to, but it wont
<span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span> to it.”</p>

<p><b>Run</b>, “to get the <span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span> upon any person,” to have the upper hand, or be
able to laugh at him. <span class="smcap">Run</span> down, to abuse or backbite any one; to
“lord it,” or “drive over” him. Originally stable slang.</p>

<p><b>Run for the money</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TO HAVE A</span>, to have a start given in with a bet.
As 20 to 1 against Doncaster, with a <span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span> given. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#P_P">P.P.</a></span> To have a
<span class="smcap lowercase">RUN FOR ONE’S MONEY</span> is also to have a good determined struggle
for anything.</p>

<p><b>Run-in</b>, to lock up in the station-house. The police are very fond of
threatening to <span class="smcap lowercase">RUN-IN</span> any person to whom they may take exception,
and, as recent revelations have shown, are by no means averse from
putting their threats into execution.</p>

<p><b>Running patterer</b>, a street seller who runs or moves briskly along,
calling aloud his wares.</p>

<p><b>Running stationer</b>, a hawker of books, ballads, dying speeches, and
newspapers. Persons of this class formerly used to run with newspapers,
blowing a horn, when they were sometimes termed <span class="smcap lowercase">FLYING
STATIONERS</span>. Nowadays, in the event of any political or social disturbance,
the miserable relics of these peripatetic newsmen bawl the
heads of the telegram or information in quiet London thoroughfares, to
the disturbance of the residents. The race is very nearly extinct, the
evening-paper boys having run them to earth.</p>

<p><b>Rush</b>, to come upon suddenly, generally for the purpose of borrowing.
To “give a man the <span class="smcap lowercase">RUSH</span>,” is to spunge upon him all day, and then
borrow money at the finish, or pursue some such similar mode of
procedure.</p>

<p><b>Rush</b>, “doing it on the <span class="smcap lowercase">RUSH</span>,” running away, or making off.</p>

<p><b>Rust</b>, “to nab the <span class="smcap lowercase">RUST</span>,” to take offence. <span class="smcap">Rusty</span>, cross, ill-tempered,
morose; not able to go through life like a person of easy and “polished”
manners.</p>

<p><b>Rustication</b>, the sending of an offender from the University for one

<p><b>Rusty guts</b>, a blunt, rough, old fellow. Corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">RUSTICUS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Rye.</b> Gipsy term for a young man. In the same parlance “rawnie” is a
young woman.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>Sack</b>, to “get the <span class="smcap lowercase">SACK</span>,” to be discharged by an employer. Varied in
the North of England to “get the <span class="smcap lowercase">BAG</span>.” In London it is sometimes
spoken of as “getting the <span class="smcap lowercase">EMPTY</span>.” It is common now to speak of
“getting the <span class="smcap lowercase">BULLET</span>,” an evident play on the word discharge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Sad dog</b>, a merry fellow, a joker, a “gay” or “fast” man.</p>

<p><b>Saddle</b>, an additional charge made by the manager to a performer upon
his benefit night.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Safe</b>, trusty, worthy of confidence. A <span class="smcap lowercase">SAFE</span> card is a man who knows
“what’s o’clock.” A <span class="smcap lowercase">SAFE</span> man among betters is one who is sure to
fulfil his engagements.</p>

<p><b><a id="Safe_un"></a>Safe un</b>, a horse which will not run, or will not try, in a race. The bookmakers
in London have the information sent them by the touts in their
pay, and lay against the <span class="smcap lowercase">SAFE UN</span>, who is also called a “stiff un,” a
“dead un,” or a “shtumer,” as often as they can, irrespective of the state
of their books. Sometimes a <span class="smcap lowercase">SAFE UN</span> will win, owing to the owner or
trainer having, for various reasons, altered his mind. Such a result then
goes to prove the “glorious uncertainty of the turf,” a phrase in very
common use among sporting writers whenever a favourite is beaten, or
whenever a horse runs slow one day and loses, and very fast the next
day and wins.</p>

<p><b>Sails</b>, nickname for the sail-maker on board ship.</p>

<p><b>St. Martin’s lace</b>, imitation gold lace; stage tinsel.</p>

<p><b>Saint Monday</b>, a holiday most religiously observed by journeymen
shoemakers and other mechanics. An Irishman observed that this
saint’s anniversary happened every week. In some parts of the country
Monday is termed Cobblers’ Sunday.</p>

<p><b>Sal</b>, a salary.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Salaam</b>, a compliment or salutation.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Salamander</b>, a street acrobat and juggler who eats fire.</p>

<p><b>Saloop</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SALEP</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SALOP</span>, a greasy-looking beverage, formerly sold on
stalls at early morning, prepared from a powder made of the root of
the <i>Orchis mascula</i>, or Red-handed Orchis. Coffee-stands have superseded
<span class="smcap lowercase">SALOOP</span> stalls; but, in addition to other writers, Charles Lamb,
in one of his papers, has left some account of this drinkable, which he
says was of all preparations the most grateful to the stomachs of young
chimney-sweeps. The present generation has no knowledge of this
drink, except that derived from books. The word “slops”&mdash;as applied
to weak, warm drink&mdash;is very likely derived from the Cockney pronunciation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">SALOOP</span>.</p>

<p><b>Salt</b>, a sailor.</p>

<p><b>Salt</b>, “it’s rather too <span class="smcap lowercase">SALT</span>,” said of an extravagant hotel bill. Also, a
sort of black mail or tribute levied on visitors or travellers by the Eton
boys, at their triennial festival called the “Montem,” by ancient
custom and privileges. It is now abolished. A periodical published
at Eton many years ago for circulation amongst the boys was called
“<i>The <span class="smcap">Salt</span>-box</i>.” When a person about to sell a business connexion
makes fictitious entries in the books of accounts, to simulate that a
much more profitable trade is carried on than there really is, he is
said to <span class="smcap lowercase">SALT</span> the books&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">SALTING</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">COOKING</span> being somewhat similar
operations. At the gold diggings of Australia, miners sometimes <span class="smcap lowercase">SALT</span>
an unproductive hole by sprinkling a few grains of gold-dust over it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and thus obtain a good price from a “green hand.” Unpromising
speculations are frequently thus <span class="smcap lowercase">SALTED</span> to entrap the unwary, the
wildest ideas being rendered palatable <i>cum grano salis</i>. And though
old birds are not readily caught by chaff, the efficacy of <span class="smcap lowercase">SALT</span> in bird-catching,
so far as the young are concerned, is proverbial.</p>

<p><b>Salt-box</b>, the condemned cell in Newgate.</p>

<p><b>Salt junk</b>, navy salt beef. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Old_horse">OLD HORSE</a></span>.</p>

<p>⁂ This curious list of numerals in use among the London street
folk is, strange as it may seem, derived from the <i>Lingua Franca</i>, or
bastard <i>Italian</i>, of the Mediterranean seaports, of which other examples
may be found in the pages of this Dictionary. <span class="smcap">Saltee</span>, the
cant term used by the costermongers and others for a penny, is no
other than the <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLDO</span> (plural, <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLDI</span>), and the numerals&mdash;as
may be seen by the <i>Italian</i> equivalents&mdash;are a tolerably close imitation
of the originals. After the number six, a curious variation occurs,
which is peculiar to the London cant, seven being reckoned as <span class="smcap lowercase">SAY
ONEY</span>, <i>six-one</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SAY DOOE</span>, <i>six-two</i> = 8, and so on. <span class="smcap">Dacha</span> is perhaps
from the <i>Greek</i> δέκα, ten, which, in the Constantinopolitan
<i>Lingua Franca</i>, is likely enough to have been substituted for the <i>Italian</i>.
<span class="smcap">Madza</span> is clearly the <i>Italian</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">MEZZA</span>. The origin of <span class="smcap lowercase">BEONG</span> has not
yet been discovered, unless it be the <i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BIEN</span>, the application of
which to a shilling is not so evident; but amongst costermongers and
other street folk it is quite immaterial what foreign tongue contributes
to their secret language. Providing the terms are unknown to the
police and the public generally, they care not a rush whether the polite
French, the gay Spaniards, or the cloudy Germans help to swell their
vocabulary. The numbers of low foreigners, however, dragging out a
miserable existence in our crowded neighbourhoods, organ grinders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and image sellers, foreign seamen from the vessels in the river, and our
own connexion with Malta and the Ionian Isles, may explain, to a
certain extent, the phenomenon of these Southern phrases in the
mouths of costers and tramps. Professor Ascoli, in his <i>Studj Critici</i>,
absurdly enough derives these words from the ancient commercial
importance of Italian settlers in England, when they gave a name to
Lombard Street!</p>

<p><b>Sam</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap">Dicky-Sam</span>, a native of Liverpool.</p>

<p><b>Sam</b>, to “stand <span class="smcap">Sam</span>,” to pay for refreshment or drink, to stand paymaster
for anything. An Americanism, originating in the letters U.S. on the

said to be the initials of Uncle Sam (the Government), who pays for

strapped, one on his breast the other on his shoulders. A “toad in
the hole” is the term applied to the same individual when his person

<p><b><a id="Satin"></a>Satin</b>, gin; “a yard of <span class="smcap lowercase">SATIN</span>,” a glass of gin. Term used by females
on make-believe errands, when the real object of their departure from
home is to replenish the private bottle. With servants the words
“tape” and “ribbon” are more common, the purchase of these feminine
requirements being the general excuse for asking to “run out for a
little while.” <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#White_satin">WHITE SATIN</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Saucebox</b>, a pert young person. In low life it also signifies the mouth.</p>

<p><b>Save</b>, to give part of one bet for part of another. A. and B. have backed
different horses, and they agree that in the event of either one winning
he shall give the other, say, £5. This is called “<span class="smcap lowercase">SAVING</span> a fiver,” and
generally is done when scratchings and knockings-out have left the
field so that one of the two speculators must be a winner. The practice
also obtains much in competitions decided in heats or rounds, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
course of which backers and layers comparing their prospects often
“<span class="smcap lowercase">SAVE</span> a bit” with each other. Saving is, therefore, a form of hedging.</p>

<p><b>Saveloy</b>, a sausage of bread and chopped beef smoked, a minor kind of
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Polony">POLONY</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Savvey</b>, to know; “do you <span class="smcap lowercase">SAVVEY</span> that?” <i>Spanish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SABE</span>. In the
nigger and <i>Anglo-Chinese patois</i>, this is <span class="smcap lowercase">SABBY</span>, “me no <span class="smcap lowercase">SABBY</span>.” It is
a general word among the lower classes all over the world. It also
means acuteness or cleverness; as, “That fellow has plenty of <span class="smcap lowercase">SAVVEY</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Saw</b>, a term at whist. A <span class="smcap lowercase">SAW</span> is established when two partners alternately
trump a suit, played to each other for the express purpose.</p>

<p><b>Saw your timber</b>, “be off!” equivalent to “cut your stick.” Occasionally
varied, with mock refinement, to “amputate your mahogany.”

<p><b>Scabby-sheep</b>, epithet applied by the vulgar to a person who has been
in questionable society, or under unholy influence, and become tainted.
Also a mean disreputable fellow.</p>

<p><b>Scaldrum dodge</b>, a dodge in use among begging impostors of burning
the body with a mixture of acids and gunpowder, so as to suit the hues
and complexions of any accident to be deplored by a confiding public.</p>

<p><b>Scaly</b>, shabby, or mean. Perhaps anything which betokens the presence
of the “Old Serpent,” or it may be a variation of “fishy.”</p>

<p><b>Scamander</b>, to wander about without a settled purpose;&mdash;possibly in
allusion to the winding course of the Homeric river of that name.</p>

<p><b>Scammered</b>, drunk.</p>

<p><b>Scamp</b>, a graceless fellow, a rascal; a wandering vagabond; scamping
was formerly the cant term for plundering and thieving. A <span class="smcap lowercase">ROYAL-SCAMP</span>
was a highwayman, whilst a <span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT-SCAMP</span> was an ordinary thief
with nothing but his legs to trust to in case of an attempt at capture.
Some have derived <span class="smcap lowercase">SCAMP</span> from <i>qui ex campo exit</i>, one who leaves the
field, a deserter.</p>

<p><b>Scamp</b>, to give short measure or quantity; applied to dishonest contractors.
Also to hurry through a task in a way which precludes the

focus for scandal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Scarborough-warning</b>, a warning given too late to be taken advantage
of. When a person is driven over, and then told to keep out
of the way, he receives <span class="smcap">Scarborough-warning</span>. Fuller says the
proverb alludes to an event which happened at that place in 1557,
when Thomas Stafford seized upon Scarborough Castle before the
townsmen had the least notice of his approach.</p>

<p><b>Scarce</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TO MAKE ONESELF</span>; to be off; to decamp.</p>

<p><b>Scarlet fever</b>, the desire felt by young ladies to flirt with officers in
preference to civilians.</p>

<p><b>Scarlet-town</b>, Reading, in Berkshire. As the name of this place is
pronounced Redding, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCARLET-TOWN</span> is probably a rude pun upon it.</p>

<p><b>Scarper</b>, to run away; <i>Spanish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ESCAPAR</span>, to escape, make off; <i>Italian</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCAPPARE</span>. “<span class="smcap lowercase">Scarper</span> with the feeley of the donna of the carzey,” to

<p><b>Sconce</b>, the head; judgment, sense.&mdash;<i>Dutch.</i></p>

<p><b>Sconce</b>, to fine. Used by Dons as well as undergrads. The Dons fined
or <span class="smcap lowercase">SCONCED</span> for small offences; <i>e.g.</i>, five shillings for wearing a coloured
coat in hall at dinner-time. Among undergrads a pun, or an oath, or
an indecent remark, was <span class="smcap lowercase">SCONCED</span> by the head of the table. If the
offender could, however, floor the tankard of beer which he was
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCONCED</span>, he could retort on his <span class="smcap lowercase">SCONCER</span> to the extent of twice the
amount he was <span class="smcap lowercase">SCONCED</span> in.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Score</b>, a reckoning, “to run up a <span class="smcap lowercase">SCORE</span> at a public-house,” to obtain
credit there until pay-day, or a fixed time, when the debt must be
“wiped off.” From the old practice of scoring a tippler’s indebtedness
on the inside of a public-house door.</p>

<p><b>Scorf</b>, to eat voraciously.</p>

<p><b>Scot</b>, a quantity of anything, a lot, a share.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCEAT</span>, pronounced
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOT</span>.</p>

<p><b>Scot</b>, temper, or passion,&mdash;from the irascible temperament of the Scotch;
“Oh! what a <span class="smcap lowercase">SCOT</span> he was in,” <i>i.e.</i>, what temper he showed.</p>

<p><b>Scotch coffee</b>, biscuits toasted and boiled in water. A gross calumny
on the much-enduring Scotians; a supposed joke on their parsimony.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Scotch_fiddle"></a>Scotch fiddle</b>, the itch; “to play the <span class="smcap">Scotch fiddle</span>,” to work the
index finger of the right hand like a fiddlestick between the index and
middle finger of the left. This provokes a Scotchman in the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
degree, as it implies that he is afflicted with the itch. It is supposed
that a continuous oatmeal diet is productive of cutaneous affection.</p>

<p><b><a id="Scotch_greys"></a>Scotch greys</b>, lice. Our northern neighbours were calumniously reported,
in the “good old times” of ignorance and prejudice, to be
peculiarly liable to cutaneous eruptions and parasites.</p>

<p><b>Scotches</b>, the legs; also synonymous with notches.</p>

<p><b>Scout</b>, a college valet, or waiter.&mdash;<i>Oxford.</i> <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Gyp">GYP</a></span>.</p>

<i>Old Cant</i>.</p>

<p><b>Scran</b>, pieces of meat, broken victuals. Formerly the reckoning at a
public-house. <span class="smcap">Scranning</span>, or “out on the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRAN</span>,” begging for broken
victuals. Also, an Irish malediction of a mild sort, “Bad <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRAN</span> to
yer!” <i>i.e.</i>, bad food to you.</p>

<p><b>Scran-bag</b>, a soldier’s haversack.&mdash;<i>Military Slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Scrap</b>, to fight. Also used as a substantive. Prize-fighters are often
known as <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRAPPERS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Scrape</b>, a difficulty; <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRAPE</span>, low wit for a shave.</p>

<p><b><a id="Scrape"></a>Scrape</b>, cheap butter; also butter laid on bread in the thinnest possible
manner, as though it had been laid on and scraped off again. “Bread
and <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRAPE</span>,” the bread and butter issued to schoolboys,&mdash;so called
from the manner in which the butter is laid on.</p>

<p><b>Scratch</b>, an imaginary meeting-point in a fight, or verbal contest;
“coming up to the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCH</span>,” preparing to fight&mdash;literally approaching
the line which used to be chalked on the ground to divide the ring.
According to the rules of the prize ring, the toe should be placed at
the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCH</span>, so the phrase often is “toeing the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCH</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Scratch</b>, “no great <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCH</span>,” of little worth.</p>

<p><b>Scratch</b>, to strike a horse’s name out of the list of runners in a particular
race. “Tomboy was <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCHED</span> for the Derby at 10 a.m. on
Wednesday, from which period all bets made in reference to him
are void.” <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#P_P">P.P.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Turf.</i> One of Boz’s characters asks whether
horses are “really made more lively by being <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCHED</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Scratch-race</b> (on the turf), a race at which the horses run at catch
weights, a race without restrictions. In boating, a race in which the
crew are picked up anyhow. A <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCH</span> crew is a crew of all sorts.</p>

<p><b>Screeve</b>, to write, or devise; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">SCREEVE</span> a fakement,” to concoct, or
write, a begging letter, or other impostor’s document. From the
<i>Dutch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHRYVEN</span>; <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHREIBEN</span>, to write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="Screever"></a>Screever</b>, a man who draws with coloured chalks on the pavement figures
of our Saviour crowned with thorns, specimens of elaborate writing,
thunderstorms, ships on fire, &amp;c. The men who attend these pavement
chalkings, and receive halfpence and sixpences from the admirers
of street art, are not always the draughtsmen. The artist or <span class="smcap lowercase">SCREEVER</span>
draws, perhaps, in half-a-dozen places in the course of a morning, and
rents the spots out to as many cadaverous-looking men, who, when
any one looks hard at them, will commence to dabble clumsily with
the short pieces of chalks they always keep at hand. There are
impostors of this kind in higher walks of art.</p>

<p><b>Screw</b>, an unsound or broken-down horse, that requires both whip and
spur to get him along. So called from the screw-like manner in which
his ribs generally show through the skin.</p>

<p><b>Screw</b>, a mean or stingy person.</p>

<p><b>Screw</b>, salary, or wages.</p>

<p><b>Screw</b>, “to put on the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCREW</span>,” to limit one’s credit, to be more exact

<p><b><a id="Screw"></a>Screw</b>, a turnkey.</p>

<p><b>Screw loose.</b> When friends become cold and distant towards each other,
it is said there is a <span class="smcap lowercase">SCREW LOOSE</span> betwixt them; the same phrase is
also used when anything goes wrong with a person’s credit or reputation.</p>

<p><b>Screwed</b>, intoxicated or drunk.</p>

<p><b>Scrimmage</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRUMMAGE</span>, a disturbance or row.&mdash;<i>Ancient.</i> Probably
a corruption of <span class="smcap lowercase">SKIRMISH</span>.</p>

<p><b>Scrimshaw.</b> Anything made by sailors for themselves in their leisure
hours at sea is termed <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRIMSHAW-WORK</span>.</p>

<p><b>Scufter</b>, a policeman.&mdash;<i>North Country.</i></p>

<p><b>Scull</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SKULL</span>, the head, or master of a college.&mdash;<i>University</i>, but nearly

church), where the “Heads of Houses” sit in solemn state, is still
nicknamed the “Golgotha” by the undergraduates.</p>

<p><b>Scurf</b>, a mean fellow. Literally a scurvy fellow.</p>

<p><b>Sea-connie</b>, the steersman of an Indian ship. By the insurance laws
he must be either a <span class="smcap lowercase">PYAH</span> Portuguese, a European, or a Manilla man,&mdash;Lascars
not being allowed to be helmsmen.</p>

<p><b>Sea-cook</b>, “son of a <span class="smcap lowercase">SEA-COOK</span>,” an opprobrious phrase used on board
ship, differing from “son of a gun,” which is generally used admiringly
or approvingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Seals</b>, a religious slang term for converts. Also a Mormon term for
wives. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Owned">OWNED</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>See.</b> Like “go” and “do,” this useful verb has long been supplemented
with a slang or unauthorized meaning. In street parlance, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">SEE</span>”
is to know or believe; “I don’t <span class="smcap lowercase">SEE</span> that,” <i>i.e.</i>, “I don’t put faith in
what you offer, or I know what you say to be untrue.”</p>

<p><b>See it out</b>, to stay out late or early, and see the gas put out. Also to
complete an undertaking.</p>

<p><b>See the king.</b> <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Elephant">ELEPHANT</a></span>.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Seedy</b>, worn-out, poverty-stricken, used-up, shabby. Metaphorical expression
from the appearance of flowers when off bloom and running
to <span class="smcap lowercase">SEED</span>; hence said of one who wears clothes until they crack and
become shabby. “How seedy he looks,” said of any man whose clothes
are worn threadbare, with greasy facings, and hat brightened up by
perspiration and continual polishing and wetting. When a man’s
coat begins to look worn-out and shabby he is said to look <span class="smcap lowercase">SEEDY</span> and
ready for cutting. This term has been in common use for nearly two
centuries, and latterly has found its way into most dictionaries. Formerly
slang, it is now a recognised word, and one of the most expressive
in the English language. The French are always amused with it,
they having no similar term.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, let my hat be e’er sae brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My coat be e’er sae <span class="smcap lowercase">SEEDY</span>, O!<br /></span>

<p><b>Seeley’s pigs</b>, blocks of iron in Government dockyards. Mr. Seeley,
M.P., was the first to call attention in the House of Commons to the
scandalous waste of pig-iron in the dockyards. Some of the yards
were found to be half paved with blocks of metal, which were thence
called “<span class="smcap">Seeley’s pigs</span>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Sell"></a>Sell</b>, a deception, or disappointment; also a lying joke.</p>

<p><b>Sell</b>, to deceive, swindle, or play a practical joke upon a person. A sham

uses <span class="smcap lowercase">SELLING</span> in a similar sense, viz., blinding or deceiving.</p>

<p><b>Sensation</b>, a quartern of gin.</p>

<p><b><a id="Serene"></a>Serene</b>, all right; “it’s all <span class="smcap lowercase">SERENE</span>,” a street phrase of very modern
adoption, the burden of a song. <span class="smcap">Serene, all serene</span>! from the
<i>Spanish</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">SERENO</span>, equivalent to the English “all’s well;” a countersign
of sentinels, supposed to have been acquired by some filibusters
who were imprisoned in Cuba, and liberated by the intercession of the
British ambassador. The Sereno, the Spanish night watchman, cries
out, with the hour, the state of the atmosphere. He was called the
Sereno (clear), from his announcing the usual fine (sereno) night&mdash;quite
different from the work of our old “Charlies,” whose usual call was
one of foul weather.</p>

<p><b>Serve out</b>, to punish, or be revenged on any one.</p>

<p><b>Setter</b>, sevenpence. <i>Italian</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SETTE</span>. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Saltee">SALTEE</a></span>.&mdash;<i>Lingua Franca.</i></p>

<p><b>Setter</b>, a person employed by the vendor at an auction to run the bidding
up; to bid against <i>bona-fide</i> bidders. Also the man who takes
the box at hazard, and “sets a go.”</p>

<p><b>Setting jewels</b>, taking the best portions of a clever book not much
known to the general public, and incorporating them quietly with
a new work by a thoroughly original author. The credit of this term

story published at Christmas, 1872, and called <i>The Wandering Heir</i>.</p>

<p><b>Settle</b>, to kill, ruin, or effectually quiet a person.</p>

in argument, or in movement.</p>

<p><b>Sevendible</b>, a very curious word, used only in the North of Ireland, to
denote something particularly severe, strong, or sound. It is, no doubt,
derived from sevendouble&mdash;that is, sevenfold&mdash;and is applied to linen
cloth, a heavy beating, a harsh reprimand, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Seven-pennorth</b>, transportation for seven years.</p>

<p><b>Seven-sided animal</b>, a one-eyed man, as he has an inside, outside,
left side, right side, foreside, backside, and blind side.</p>

the <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CHACUN POUR SOI</span>.</p>

<p><b>Shackly</b>, loose, rickety.&mdash;<i>Devonshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Shady</b>, an expression implying decadence. On “the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHADY</span> side of
forty” implies that a person is considerably older than forty. <span class="smcap">Shady</span>
also means inferiority in other senses. A “shady trick” is either a
shabby one, mean or trumpery, or else it is one contemptible from the
want of ability displayed. The <span class="smcap lowercase">SHADY</span> side of a question is, and fairly
enough too, that which has no brightness to recommend it.</p>

<p><b>Shake</b>, a disreputable man or woman.&mdash;<i>North.</i> In London a <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAKE</span> is
a prostitute.</p>

<p><b>Shake-down</b>, an improvised bed.</p>

to our Quakers, as is generally believed. They have very strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
notions on things in general, and especially on marriage and the connexion
of the sexes.</p>

<p><b>Shakes</b>, a bad bargain is said to be “no great <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAKES</span>;” “pretty fair
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHAKES</span>” is anything good or favourable.&mdash;<i>Byron.</i> In America, a fair
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHAKE</span> is a fair trade or a good bargain.</p>

<p><b>Shakes</b>, “in a brace of <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAKES</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, in an instant.</p>

<p><b><a id="Shakester"></a>Shakester</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SHICKSTER</span>, a female. Amongst costermongers this term
is invariably applied to ladies, or the wives of tradesmen, and females
generally, of the classes immediately above them. Amongst Jews the
word signifies a woman of shady antecedents. Supposed to be derived
from the <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SHIKTZA</span>. It is generally pronounced “shickser.”</p>

<p><b>Shallows</b>, “to go on the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHALLOWS</span>,” to go half naked.</p>

<p><b>Sham</b>, contraction of champagne. In general use among the lower
class of sporting men. Sometimes extended to <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAMMY</span>.</p>

<p><b>Sham Abraham</b>, to feign sickness. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Abraham-sham">Abraham</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Shanks’s mare</b>, “to ride <span class="smcap lowercase">SHANK’S MARE</span>,” to go on foot.</p>

<p><b>Shant</b>, a pot or quart; “<span class="smcap lowercase">SHANT</span> of bivvy,” a quart of beer.</p>

<p><b>Shanty</b>, a rude, temporary habitation. The word is principally employed
to designate the huts inhabited by navigators, when constructing
large lines of railway far distant from towns. It is derived from the
<i>French</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CHANTIER</span>, used by the Canadians for a log hut, and has
travelled from thence, by way of the United States, to England.</p>

<p><b>Shanty</b>, a song. A term in use among sailors. From <span class="smcap lowercase">CHANTER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Shapes</b>, “to cut up” or “show <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAPES</span>,” to exhibit pranks, or flightiness.</p>

<p><b>Shark</b>, a sharper, a swindler. Bow Street term in 1785, now in most
dictionaries.&mdash;<i>Friesic</i> and <i>Danish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHURK</span>. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Land-shark">LAND-SHARK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Sharp</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SHARPER</span>, a cunning cheat, a rogue,&mdash;the opposite of <span class="smcap lowercase">FLAT</span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Sharp"></a>Sharp</b>, a similar expression to “<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Two_upon_ten">TWO PUN’ TEN</a></span>” (which <i>see</i>), used by
assistants in shops to signify that a customer of suspected honesty is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
amongst them. The shopman in this case would ask one of the assistants,
in a voice loud enough to be generally heard, “Has Mr. <span class="smcap">Sharp</span>
come in yet?” “No,” would probably be the reply; “but he is
expected every minute.” The signal is at once understood, and a
general look-out kept upon the suspected party.</p>

<p><b>Sharp’s-alley blood-worms</b>, beef sausages and black puddings.
Sharp’s Alley was, until City improvements caused it to be destroyed,
a noted slaughtering-place near Smithfield.</p>

<p><b>Shave</b>, a false alarm, a hoax, a sell. This term was much in vogue in
the Crimea during the Russian campaign,&mdash;that is, though much used
by the military before then, the term did not, until that period, become
known to the general public.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Shave</b>, a narrow escape. At Cambridge, “just <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAVING</span> through,” or
“making a <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAVE</span>,” is just escaping a “pluck” by coming out at the
bottom of the list.</p>

<p><b>Shave;</b> “to <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAVE</span> a customer,” charge him more for an article than the
marked price. Used in the drapery trade. When the master sees an
opportunity of doing this, he strokes his chin, as a signal to his assistant
who is serving the customer.</p>

<p><b>Shaver</b>, a sharp fellow; there are young and old <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAVERS</span>.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Shebeen</b>, an unlicensed place where spirituous liquors are illegally sold.
A word almost peculiar to Ireland.</p>

<p><b><a id="Shed_a_tear"></a>Shed a tear</b>, to take a dram, or glass of neat spirits; jocular phrase
used, with a sort of grim earnestness, by old topers to each other.
“Now then, old fellow, come and <span class="smcap lowercase">SHED A TEAR</span>!” an invitation to
take “summat short.” The origin may have been that ardent spirits,
taken neat by younger persons, usually bring water to their eyes.
With confirmed drinkers, however, the phrase is used with an air of
mingled humour and regret at their own position. A still more pathetic
phrase is&mdash;“putting a <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Nail_in_ones_coffin">NAIL IN ONE’S COFFIN</a></span>,” which <i>see</i>. The term
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHED A TEAR</span> is probably derived from “eye-water.”</p>

<p><b>Sheen</b>, bad money.&mdash;<i>Scotch.</i></p>

<p><b>Sheeny</b>, a Jew. This word is used by both Jew and Gentile at the East-end
of London, and is not considered objectionable on either side.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Sheep’s eyes</b>, loving looks, “to make <span class="smcap lowercase">SHEEP’S EYES</span> at a person,” to

so situated when they cannot meet with husbands. “On the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHELF</span>”
also means pawned, or laid by in trust.</p>

<p><b>Shell out</b>, to pay or count out money. Also a game played on a billiard
table, a variation of pool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Shepherd</b>, to look after carefully, to place under police surveillance.</p>

<p><b>Shice</b>, nothing; “to do anything for <span class="smcap lowercase">SHICE</span>,” to get no payment. The
term was first used by the Jews in the last century. Grose gives the
phrase <span class="smcap lowercase">CHICE-AM-A-TRICE</span>, which has a synonymous meaning. <i>Spanish</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHICO</span>, little; <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CHICHE</span>, niggardly; or perhaps connected
with the <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHEISSEN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Shicer</b>, a mean man, a humbug, a “duffer,”&mdash;a worthless person, one
who will not work. This is the worst term one Jew can use to another.
At the diggings it means a hole which yields nothing.</p>

<p><b>Shickery</b>, shabby, bad. From <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Shaky">SHAKY</a></span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAKERY</span>.</p>

<p><b>Shigs</b>, money, silver.&mdash;<i>East London.</i></p>

<p><b>Shikaree</b>, a hunter, a sportsman.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i> An English sportsman
who has seen many ups and downs in jungles of the East styles himself
“an <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD SHIKAREE</span>.”&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i> Also spelt <span class="smcap lowercase">SHEKARRY</span>.</p>

<p><b>Shilly-shally</b>, to trifle or fritter away time; to be irresolute. Corruption

<p><b>Shin-plaster</b>, a bank-note. Originally an Americanism.</p>

<p><b>Shins.</b> “To break one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">SHINS</span>,” figurative expression meaning to borrow
money.</p>

<p><b>Ship-shape</b>, proper, in good order; sometimes the phrase is varied to
“<span class="smcap lowercase">SHIP-SHAPE</span> and Bristol fashion.”&mdash;<i>Sea.</i> The latter portion of the
expression went out with Bristol’s fame as a seaport.</p>

<p><b>Shirty</b>, ill-tempered, or cross. When one person makes another in an
ill-humour he is said to have “got his <span class="smcap lowercase">SHIRT</span> out.”</p>

<p><b>Shivering Jemmy</b>, the name given by street-folk to any cadger who
exposes himself, half naked, on a cold day, to obtain alms. The
“game” is unpleasant, but was, before exposure of a different kind
spoilt it, exceedingly lucrative.</p>

<p><b>Shockhead</b>, a head of long, unkempt, and rough hair.</p>

<p><b><a id="Shoddy"></a>Shoddy</b>, old cloth worked up into new; made from soldiers’ and policemen’s
coats. The old cloth is pulled to pieces, the yarn unravelled
and carded over again. This produces shoddy, which is very short in
the fibre, and from it are produced, on again twisting and weaving,
cloth fabrics used for ladies’ mantles, &amp;c. Also, a term of derision
applied to workmen in woollen factories.&mdash;<i>Yorkshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Shoddy</b>, the plutocracy created out of bogus contracts during the civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>

the expense of their country in the most shameless manner, having most
likely studied under those contractors who should have supplied our
soldiers with necessaries during the Crimean War.</p>

<p><b><a id="Shoe"></a>Shoe</b>, to free or initiate a person,&mdash;a practice common in most trades to
a new-comer. The <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOEING</span> consists in paying for beer, or other
liquor, which is drunk by the older hands. The cans emptied, and the
bill paid, the stranger is considered properly <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOD</span>. <span class="smcap">Shoeing</span> is a
variation of “paying one’s footing.”</p>

<p><b>Shoe leather!</b> a thief’s warning cry when he hears footsteps. This
exclamation is used in the spirit which animated the friend who, when
he suspected treachery towards Bruce at King Edward’s court, in
1306, sent him a purse and a pair of spurs, as a sign that he should use
them in making his escape.</p>

<p><b>Shoes</b>, “to die in one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOES</span>,” to be hanged. In the old hanging days
a highwayman would often kick off his shoes when the rope was round
his neck, so as&mdash;oh, vain and impotent attempt!&mdash;to defeat the prophecy
that had foreshadowed his present position.</p>

<div>
<p><b><a id="Shoes_childrens"></a>Shoes, children’s, to make</b>, to suffer oneself to be made sport of,
or depreciated. Commonly used in Norfolk.&mdash;<i>Cf.</i> Mrs. Behn’s comedy,
<i>The Roundheads</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Hews.</i> “Who, pox! shall we stand <span class="smcap lowercase">MAKING CHILDREN’S SHOES</span> all the year? No:

<p><b>Shoful</b>, a Hansom cab. This favourite carriage was the invention of a
Mr. Hansom, afterwards connected with the <i>Builder</i> newspaper. It
has been asserted that the term <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOFUL</span> was derived from “shovel,”
the earliest slang term applied to Hansoms by other cab-drivers, who
conceived their shape to be after the fashion of a scoop or shovel. A
logical friend of the present Editor’s argues thus:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shoful</span>, full of
show, <i>ergo</i>, beautiful&mdash;handsome&mdash;Hansom. This is clever, but it
certainly never entered into the heads of those who gave the name of
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOFUL</span> to the Hansom cabs.</p>

<p><b><a id="Shoful"></a>Shoful</b>, bad or counterfeit money. Perhaps, as some think, from the
<i>Danish</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SKUFFE</span>, to shove, to deceive, cheat; <i>Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCUFAN</span>,&mdash;whence
the <i>English</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOVE</span>. The term, however, is possibly one of
the many street words from the <i>Hebrew</i> (through the low Jews);
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHEPHEL</span>, in that language, signifying a low or debased estate. <i>Chaldee</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHAPHAL</span>.&mdash;<i>See</i> Psalm cxxxvi. 23, “in our low estate.” A correspondent
suggests a very probable derivation, from the <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHOFEL</span>,
trash, rubbish,&mdash;the <i>German</i> adjective, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHOFELIG</span>, being the nearest
possible translation of our shabby. <span class="smcap">Shoful</span> means anything mock, as
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOFUL</span> jewellery. A <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOFUL</span> is also a humbug, an impostor.</p>

<p><b>Shoful-pitcher</b>, a passer of bad money. <span class="smcap">Shoful-pitching</span>, passing
bad money. “Snide-pitcher” and “Snide-pitching” are terms exchangeable
with the preceding.</p>

<p><b>Shoful pullet</b>, a “gay” or unsteady woman, especially a young woman.</p>

<p><b>Sholl</b>, to bonnet one, or crush a person’s hat over his eyes.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Shool</b>, to saunter idly, to become a vagabond, to beg rather than work.&mdash;<i>Smollett’s
Roderick Random</i>, vol. i., p. 262.</p>

<p><b>Shool</b>, Jews’ term for their synagogue.</p>

<p><b><a id="Shoot_the_cat"></a>Shoot the cat</b>, to vomit. From a story of a man being sick in the back
yard, and suffocating a cat and all her kittens.</p>

<p><b>Shoot the moon</b>, to remove furniture from a house in the night without
paying the landlord.</p>

<p><b>Shop.</b> In racing slang, to secure first, second, or third position in a race, is
to get a <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOP</span>. This is also known as a place, and as a situation.
<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Place">PLACE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Shop</b>, a house. “How are they all at your <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOP</span>?” is a common question
among small tradesmen.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Shop</b>, the House of Commons. The only instance we have met with of
the use of this word in literature occurs in Mr. Trollope’s <i>Framley
Parsonage:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘If we are merely to do as we are bid, and have no voice of our own, I don’t see
what’s the good of our going to the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOP</span> at all,’ said Mr. Sowerby.”</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Shop</b>, to discharge a shopman. In military slang, to <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOP</span> an officer is
to put him under arrest in the guard-room. In pugilistic slang, to
punish a man severely is “to knock him all over the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOP</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, the
ring, the place in which the work is done.</p>

<p><b>Shop-bouncer</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOP-LIFTER</span>, a person generally respectably attired,
who, while being served with a small article at a shop, steals one of
more value. Shakspeare has the word <span class="smcap lowercase">LIFTER</span>, a thief.</p>

<p><b>Shop-walker</b>, a person employed to walk up and down a shop, to hand
seats to customers, and see that they are properly served. Contracted
also to <span class="smcap lowercase">WALKER</span>.</p>

used by Cowper and Byron.</p>

<p><b>Shoppy</b>, to be full of nothing but one’s own calling or profession; “to
talk <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOP</span>,” to converse of nothing but professional subjects.</p>

<p><b><a id="Short"></a>Short</b>, when spirit is drunk without any admixture of water, it is said to
be taken “<span class="smcap lowercase">SHORT</span>;” “summat <span class="smcap lowercase">SHORT</span>,” a dram. A similar phrase is
used at the counters of banks; upon presenting a cheque, the clerk asks,
“How will you take it?” <i>i.e.</i>, in gold, or notes. If in notes, long or
short? Should it be desired to receive it in notes for the largest
possible amount, the answer is, <span class="smcap lowercase">SHORT</span>. A conductor of an omnibus,
or any other servant, is said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">SHORT</span> when he does not give all the
money he receives to his master.</p>

<p><b>Short</b>, hard-up; a polite term for impecuniosity used in clubs and among
military men.</p>

<p><b>Short commons</b>, short allowance of food. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Commons">COMMONS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Shorter</b>, one who makes a dishonest profit by reducing the coin of the
realm by clipping and filing. From a crown-piece a <span class="smcap lowercase">SHORTER</span> could
gain 5d. Another way was by chemical means: a guinea laid in aquafortis
would, in twelve hours, precipitate 9d.-worth of sediment; in
twenty-four, 1s. 6d.-worth.&mdash;<i>Rommany Rye.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Shot</b>, from the modern sense of the word to <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOOT</span>,&mdash;a guess, a random
conjecture; “to make a bad <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOT</span>,” to expose one’s ignorance by

<p><b>Shot</b>, “I wish I may be <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOT</span>, if,” &amp;c., a common form of mild swearing.</p>

<p><b>Shot</b>, a term used among horse chaunters. To <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOT</span> a horse, is to give
him a lot of small shot, which will for a short time effectually “open
his pipes,” and make him appear sound in wind.</p>

<p><b>Shot in the locker</b>, money in pocket, resource of any kind in store.&mdash;<i>Navy.</i></p>

<p><b>Shoulder</b>, when a servant embezzles his master’s money, he is said to
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOULDER</span> his employer.</p>

<p><b>Shout</b>, to pay for drink round. “It’s my <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOUT</span>,” says he who pays.
Possibly because the payer originally <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOUTED</span> to the bar-keeper of an
hotel to score the drink to him.&mdash;<i>Australian</i>, but now general.</p>

<p><b>Shove-halfpenny</b>, a gambling pot-house pastime, played on a table.

<p><b>Shove in the mouth</b>, a glass of spirits, which is taken off quickly and

<p><b>Shut of</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOT OF</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, rid of. A very common expression amongst

you sell them all?</p>

<p><b>Shut up!</b> be quiet, don’t make a noise; to stop short, to cease in a
summary manner, to silence effectually. The following is from a
literary paper:&mdash;“Only the other day we heard of a preacher who,
speaking of the scene with the doctors in the Temple, remarked that
the Divine disputant completely <span class="smcap lowercase">SHUT THEM UP</span>!” <span class="smcap">Shut up</span>, utterly

sticks at trinkets or cocoanuts set upon other sticks,&mdash;both name and
practice derived from the old game of throwing or <span class="smcap lowercase">SHYING</span> at live
cocks. This game is best known to the London public as “three shies
a penny.”</p>

<p><b>Shy.</b> “To fight <span class="smcap lowercase">SHY</span> of a person,” to avoid his society either from dislike,

<p><b>Silly season</b>, the period when nobody is supposed to be in London,
when there are no parliamentary debates to publish, and when editors
are at their wits’-ends to fill their papers with readable matter. All
kinds of crazes on political and social subjects are then ventilated,
gigantic gooseberries, monstrous births, and strange showers then become
plentiful, columns are devoted to matters which would not at any
other time receive consideration, and, so far as the newspapers are concerned,
silliness is at a premium.</p>

<p><b><a id="Silver_beggar"></a>Silver beggar</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">LURKER</span>, a vagabond who travels through the country
with “briefs” containing false statements of losses by fire, shipwrecks,
accidents, &amp;c. Forged documents are exhibited with signatures of

have witnessed Mr. Charles Mathews’s performance in Mrs. Centlivre’s
admirable comedy of <i>A Bold Stroke for a Wife</i>, and the laughable
coolness with which he, the false <span class="smcap">Simon Pure</span>, assuming the Quaker
dress and character of the real one, elbows that worthy out of his expected
entertainment, will at once perceive the origin of this phrase.&mdash;<i>See</i>
act v. scene i.</p>

<p><b><a id="Simpkin"></a>Simpkin</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SIMKIN</span>, champagne.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i> Derived from the

a sort of apology for alluding to anything likely to shock one’s sense of
decency. <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SALVÂ REVERENTIÂ</span>. <i>See</i> Shakspeare’s <i>Romeo and

ordure generally, but sometimes other indecencies.</p>

<p><b>Siserara</b>, a hard blow.&mdash;<i>Suffolk.</i> Many derive this term from the story
of Sisera in the Old Testament, but it is probably a corruption of
<span class="smcap lowercase">CERTIORARI</span>, a Chancery writ reciting a complaint of hard usage.</p>

<p><b>Sit under</b>, a term employed in Dissenters’ meeting-houses, to denote
attendance on the ministry of any particular preacher.</p>

<p><b>Sit upon</b>, to overcome or rebuke, to express contempt for a man in a
marked manner. Also, to chaff or “roast” a man consumedly.</p>

<p><b>Sit-upons</b>, trousers. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Inexpressibles">INEXPRESSIBLES</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Sivvy</b>, “’pon my <span class="smcap lowercase">SIVVY</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, upon my soul or honour. Corruption of
“asseveration,” like <span class="smcap lowercase">DAVY</span>, which is an abridgment of “affidavit.”</p>

<p><b>Sixes and sevens</b>, articles in confusion are said to be all <span class="smcap lowercase">SIXES AND
SEVENS</span>. The Deity is mentioned in the <i>Towneley Mysteries</i> as He
that “set all on seven,” <i>i.e.</i>, set or appointed everything in seven
days. A similar phrase at this early date implied confusion and disorder,
and from these, Halliwell thinks, has been derived the phrase
“to be at <span class="smcap lowercase">SIXES AND SEVENS</span>.” A Scotch correspondent, however,
states that the phrase probably came from the workshop, and that
amongst needle-makers, when the points and eyes are “heads and
tails” (“heeds and thraws”), or in confusion, they are said to be
<span class="smcap lowercase">SIXES AND SEVENS</span>, because those numbers are the sizes most generally
used, and in the course of manufacture have frequently to be
distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Sixty</b>, “to go along like <span class="smcap lowercase">SIXTY</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, at a good rate, briskly.</p>

<p><b>Sixty-per-cent</b>, a bill-discounter. From the rate of interest generally
charged. If bill-discounters profess to do the business for less, they
generally make up the level sixty by extras.</p>

<p><b>Six-water grog</b>, a sea-term for the weakest grog possible&mdash;six portions
of water to one of rum&mdash;hardly enough spirit to “swear by.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Size"></a>Size</b>, to order extras over and above the usual commons at the dinner in
college halls. Soup, pastry, &amp;c., are <span class="smcap lowercase">SIZINGS</span>, and are paid for at a
certain specified rate per <span class="smcap lowercase">SIZE</span>, or portion, to the college cook. Peculiar
to Cambridge. Minsheu says, “<span class="smcap lowercase">SIZE</span>, a farthing which schollers in
Cambridge have at the buttery, noted with the letter <i>s</i>.”</p>

<p><b>Sizers</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SIZARS</span>, certain poor scholars at Cambridge, annually elected,
who got their dinners (including “sizings”) from what was left at the
upper, or Fellows’ table, free, or nearly so. They paid rent of rooms,
and some other fees, on a lower scale than the “Pensioners” or ordinary
students, and were equal with the “battlers” and “servitors” at Oxford.</p>

<p><b>Sizings.</b> <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Size">SIZE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Skedaddle</b>, to go off in a hurry. The American war introduced this
new and amusing word. A Northerner who retreated “retired upon
his supports,” but a Southerner was said to <span class="smcap lowercase">SKEDADDLE</span>. The
<i>Times</i> remarked on the word, and Lord Hill wrote to prove that it was
excellent Scotch. The Americans only misapply the word, which
means, in Dumfries, “to spill”&mdash;milkmaids, for example, saying,
“You are <span class="smcap lowercase">SKEDADDLING</span> all that milk.” The Yankees therefore
adopted the term, and altered the application.</p>

<p><b>Skid</b>, a sovereign. Fashionable slang. Occasionally <span class="smcap lowercase">SKIV</span>.</p>

<p><b>Skid</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SKIDPAN</span>, an instrument for locking the wheel of a coach when
going down hill. It is often said that a talkative person might put the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SKID</span> on, with advantage to his listeners, if not to himself.</p>

<p><b>Skied</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SKYED</span>, thrown upwards, as “coppers” in tossing.</p>

<p><b><a id="Skied"></a>Skied.</b> Artists say that a picture is <span class="smcap lowercase">SKIED</span> when it is hung on the upper
line at the Exhibition of the Royal Academy. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Floored">FLOORED</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Skilligolee</b>, prison gruel. Also sailors’ soup of many ingredients. The
term is occasionally used in London workhouses.</p>

<p><b>Skilly</b>, abbreviation of <span class="smcap lowercase">SKILLIGOLEE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Skimmery</b>, St. Mary Hall, Oxford.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Skin</b>, a purse. This term is mostly in use among thieves.</p>

<p><b>Skin</b>, to abate, or lower the value of anything; “thin-<span class="smcap lowercase">SKINNED</span>,” sensitive,
touchy, liable to be “raw” on certain subjects.</p>

<p><b><a id="Skin-the-lamb"></a>Skin-the-lamb</b>, a game at cards, a very expressive corruption of the
term “lansquenet,” also a racing term. When a non-favourite wins a
race, bookmakers are said to <span class="smcap lowercase">SKIN THE LAMB</span>, under the supposition
that they win all their bets, no person having backed the winner. This
has been corrupted into <span class="smcap lowercase">SKINNER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Skinflint</b>, an old and popular simile for a “close-fisted,” stingy person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Sternberg, in his <i>Northamptonshire Glossary</i>, says the Eastern languages
have the same expression. Abdul-Malek, one of the Ommeyade
Khaliphs, noted for his extreme avarice, was surnamed Raschal-Hegiarah,
literally, “the <span class="smcap lowercase">SKINNER</span> of a <span class="smcap lowercase">FLINT</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Skinner</b>, a term among bookmakers. “May we have a <span class="smcap lowercase">SKINNER</span>,”
<i>i.e.</i>, may we <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Skin-the-lamb">SKIN THE LAMB</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Skipper</b>, the master of a vessel. <i>Germ.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHIFFER</span>, from <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHIFF</span>, a ship;
sometimes used as synonymous with “governor.”</p>

<p><b>Skipper</b>, a barn.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i> From the <i>Welsh</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">YSGUBOR</span>, pronounced
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCYBOR</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SCIBOR</span>, the proper word in that language for a barn.</p>

<p><b>Skipper-birds</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">KEYHOLE-WHISTLERS</span>, persons who sleep in barns
or outhouses from necessity or in preference to sleeping in lodging-houses.</p>

<p><b>Skipper-it</b>, to sleep in the open air, or in a rough way.</p>

<p><b>Skit</b>, a joke, a squib. Term generally used in reference to any pungent
or pointed political allusion.</p>

<p><b>Skittles</b>, a game similar to that of Ten Pins, which, when interdicted
by the Government, was altered to Nine Pins, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SKITTLES</span>. The pins
are set up in an alley, and thrown (not bowled) at with a round piece
of hard wood, shaped like a small flat cheese. The costers used to
consider themselves the best players in London, but they have been
frequently undeceived. <span class="smcap">Skittles</span> has within the past few years received
an awful blow&mdash;quite a floorer&mdash;from “the powers that be.”</p>

<p><b>Skow-banker</b>, a fellow who loiters about the premises of any one
willing to support him, and who objects to the necessity of working
for his living; a rogue, a rascal. Common in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

<p><b>Skrouge</b>, to push or squeeze.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b>Skull-thatcher</b>, a straw-bonnet-maker,&mdash;sometimes called “a bonnet-<span class="smcap lowercase">BUILDER</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Skunk</b>, a mean or paltry fellow, one whose name stinks.</p>

<p><b>Sky</b>, a disagreeable person, an enemy.&mdash;<i>Westminster School.</i> The word
derived its origin from a corruption of the last syllable of the word
“<span class="smcap lowercase">VOLSCI</span>:” Westminster boys being of course understood to be the
Romans.</p>

<p><b>Sky</b>, to toss up towards the <span class="smcap lowercase">SKY</span>. Term used in tossing with halfpence;
“It’s all right, Jim <span class="smcap lowercase">SKIED</span> the browns,” <i>i.e.</i>, threw them up, a proof
that there could have been no collusion or cheating.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Sky-blue</b>, London milk much diluted with water, or from which the
cream has been too closely skimmed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hence, Suffolk dairy wives run mad for cream,<br /></span>

<p><b>Sky-parlour</b>, the garret.</p>

<p><b>Sky-scraper</b>, a tall man; “Are you cold up there, old <span class="smcap lowercase">SKY-SCRAPER</span>?”
Properly a sea-term. The light sails, which some adventurous skippers
set above the royals in calm latitudes, are termed <span class="smcap lowercase">SKY-SCRAPERS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">MOON-RAKERS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Sky-wannocking</b>, unsteady frolicking.&mdash;<i>Norfolk.</i></p>

<p><b>Slab</b>, thick, as gruel, porridge, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Slack</b>, “to hold on the <span class="smcap lowercase">SLACK</span>,” to skulk; a slack rope not requiring to
be held.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Slam</b>, a term at the game of whist. When two partners gain the whole
thirteen tricks, they win a <span class="smcap lowercase">SLAM</span>, which is considered equal to a rubber.</p>

<p><b>Slam</b>, to talk fluently. “He’s the bloke to <span class="smcap lowercase">SLAM</span>.” From a term in use
among birdsingers at the East-end, by which they denote a certain style
of note in chaffinches.</p>

<p><b>Slammock</b>, a slattern or awkward person.&mdash;<i>West</i>, and <i>Norfolk</i>.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Slang</b>, low, vulgar, unwritten, or unauthorized language. <i>Gipsy</i>, <span class="smcap">Slang</span>,
the secret language of the gipsies, synonymous with <span class="smcap">Gibberish</span>,
another gipsy word. The word is only to be found in the dictionaries
of Webster and Ogilvie. It is given, however, by Grose, in his
<i>Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>, 1785. <span class="smcap">Slang</span>, since it has been
adopted as an English word, generally implies vulgar language not
known or recognised as <span class="smcap lowercase">CANT</span>; and latterly, when applied to speech,
it has superseded the word <span class="smcap lowercase">FLASH</span>. Latterly, however, <span class="smcap lowercase">SLANG</span> has
become the generic term for all unauthorized language. The earliest
instance of the use of the word that can be found, is the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let proper nurses be assigned, to take care of these babes of grace, [young
thieves].... The master who teaches them should be a man well versed in
the cant language commonly called the <span class="smcap lowercase">SLANG</span> patter, in which they should
by all means excel.”&mdash;<i>Jonathan Wild’s Advice to his Successor.</i> <span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>J. Scott</i>, 1758.</p></div>
</div>


<p><b>Slang</b>, a travelling show.</p>

<p><b>Slang</b>, to cheat, to abuse in foul language.</p>

<p><b>Slang</b>, counterfeit or short weights and measures. A <span class="smcap lowercase">SLANG</span> quart is a
pint and a half. <span class="smcap">Slang</span> measures are lent out at 2d. per day to street
salesmen. The term is used principally by costermongers.</p>

<p><b>Slang</b>, a watch-chain. <span class="smcap">Super</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">SLANG</span>, a watch and chain.</p>

<p><b>Slang</b>, “out on the <span class="smcap lowercase">SLANG</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, to travel with a hawker’s licence.</p>

<p><b>Slang-whanger</b>, a long-winded speaker.&mdash;<i>Parliamentary.</i></p>

<p><b>Slangy</b>, flashy, vulgar; loud in dress, manner, and conversation.</p>

<p><b>Slantingdicular</b>, oblique, awry,&mdash;as opposed to <span class="smcap lowercase">PERPENDICULAR</span>.
Originally an Americanism, now a part of the vocabulary of London
“high life below stairs.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Slap"></a>Slap</b>, paint for the face, rouge.</p>

<p><b>Slap</b>, exactly, precisely; “<span class="smcap lowercase">SLAP</span> in the wind’s eye,” <i>i.e.</i>, exactly to windward.</p>

<p><b>Slap-bang</b>, suddenly, violently. From the strike of a ball being felt
before the report reaches the ear,&mdash;the <span class="smcap lowercase">SLAP</span> first, the <span class="smcap lowercase">BANG</span> afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Slap-bang-shops</b>, originally low eating-houses where the ready-money
was paid down with a <span class="smcap lowercase">SLAP-BANG</span>.&mdash;<i>Grose.</i> A <span class="smcap lowercase">SLAP-BANG-SHOP</span> is
now a very pretentious eating-house.</p>

<p><b>Slap-dash</b>, immediately, or quickly; at a great rate.</p>

<p><b>Slap-up</b>, first-rate, excellent, very good.</p>

<p><b>Slasher</b>, a powerful roysterer, a game and clever pugilist.</p>

<p><b>Slashers</b>, the Twenty-eighth Regiment of Foot in the British army.</p>

<p><b>Slate</b>, “he has a <span class="smcap lowercase">SLATE</span> loose,” <i>i.e.</i>, he is slightly crazy.</p>

<p><b>Slate</b>, to pelt with abuse, to beat, to “lick;” or, in the language of the

particular man or animal in a race.</p>

<p><b>Slate</b>, to knock the hat over one’s eyes, to bonnet.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b>Slavey</b>, a maid-servant.</p>

<p><b>Sleepless-hats</b>, those of a napless character, better known as <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Wide-awake">WIDE-AWAKES</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Slender</b>, a simple country gentleman.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>

<p><b>Slewed</b>, drunk, or intoxicated.&mdash;<i>Sea term.</i> When a vessel changes the
tack, she, as it were, staggers, the sails flap, she gradually heels over,
and the wind catching the waiting canvas, she glides off at another
angle. The course pursued by an intoxicated, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SLEWED</span>, man, is
supposed to be analogous to that of the ship.</p>

<p><b>Slick</b>, an Americanism, very prevalent in England since the publication
of Judge Haliburton’s facetious stories, which means rapidly, effectually,
utterly.</p>

<p><b>Slick</b>, smooth, unctuous; abbreviation of sleek.</p>

<p><b>Sling</b>, a drink peculiar to Americans, generally composed of gin, soda-water,
ice, and slices of lemon. At some houses in London <span class="smcap lowercase">GIN-SLINGS</span>
may be obtained.</p>

<p><b>Sling</b>, to pass from one person to another. To blow the nose with the
naked fingers.</p>

<p><b>Sling your hook</b>, a polite invitation to move-on. “Sling your Daniel”
has the same meaning. The pronouns may be altered to suit the
context.</p>

<p><b>Slip</b>, “to give the <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIP</span>,” to run away, or elude pursuit. Shakspeare
has, “You gave me the counterfeit,” in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Giving
the <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIP</span>, however, is a sea phrase, and refers to fastening an anchor
and chain cable to a floating buoy, or water-cask, until a time arrives
when it is convenient to return and take them on board. In fastening
the cable, the home end is <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIPPED</span> through the hawse-pipe. Weighing
anchor is a noisy task, so that giving the <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIP</span> infers leaving quietly.</p>

<p><b><a id="Slip"></a>Slip</b>, or let <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIP</span>; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIP</span> into a man,” to give him a sound beating,
“to let <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIP</span> at a cove,” to rush violently upon him, and assault with
vigour.</p>

<p><b>Slipping</b>, a trick of card-sharpers, in the performance of which, by dexterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
manipulation, they place the cut card on the top, instead of at
the bottom of the pack. It is the <i>faire sauter la coupe</i> of the French.
In pugilistic parlance, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIP</span> a man,” is to “duck and get away”
with great dexterity.</p>

<p><b>Slips</b>, the sides of the gallery in a theatre are generally so called.</p>

<p><b>Slog</b>, to beat or baste, to fight. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHLACHTEN</span>; or perhaps from
some connexion with the <i>Gaelic</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">SLOGAN</span>. The pretended <i>Greek</i>
derivation from σλογω is humbug, there being no such word in the
language.</p>

<p><b>Slogdollager</b>, an Americanism, meaning the same as our <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Stockdollager">STOCKDOLLAGER</a></span>,
which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Sloggers"></a>Sloggers</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SLOW-GOERS</span>, the second division of race-boats at Cambridge.
At Oxford they are called <span class="smcap lowercase">TORPIDS</span>.&mdash;<i>University.</i> A hard
hitter at cricket is termed a <span class="smcap lowercase">SLOGGER</span>; so is a pugilist.</p>

<p><b>Slogging</b>, a good beating.</p>

<p><b>Slop</b>, a policeman. At first back slang, but now modified for general use.</p>

<p><b>Slop</b>, cheap, or ready-made, as applied to clothing, is generally supposed
to be a modern appropriation; but it was used in this sense in 1691,
by Maydman, in his <i>Naval Speculations</i>; and by Chaucer two centuries
before that. <span class="smcap">Slops</span> properly signify sailors’ working clothes, which
are of a very cheap and inexpensive character.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Slope</b>, to decamp, to run, or rather slip away. Some persons think it
came originally from <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Lope">LOPE</a></span>, to make off; and that the <i>s</i> probably became
affixed as a portion of the preceding word, as in the case of “Let’s lope,”
let us run. It is purely an Americanism, and is possibly but an emendation
of our own word elope. Lope, leap, and elope are kindred.
A humorous correspondent says that Tennyson is decidedly partial to
slang, and instances amongst other proofs a passage from the laureate’s
famous <i>Locksley Hall</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Many a night, from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I look on great Orion <span class="smcap lowercase">SLOPING</span> slowly to the west.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though this correspondent may not have intended it, his joke has
given the key to the situation, and has shown how our cousins most
probably came to use the word in its present sense. “The sun is
<span class="smcap lowercase">SLOPING</span> fast.”</p>
</div>

<p><b>Slops</b>, any weak, wet, and warm mixture. Hard drinkers regard all
effeminate beverages as <span class="smcap lowercase">SLOPS</span>.</p>

<p><b>Slops</b>, liquid house-refuse.</p>

<p><b>Slopshop</b>, a tailor’s shop where inferior work is done, and where cheap
goods are sold.</p>

leaving for the country, say they are going out of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SMOKE</span>.</p>

<p><b>Smoke</b>, to detect, or penetrate an artifice. Originally used by London

<p><b>Snapps</b>, spirits. <i>Dutch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHNAPPS</span>. The word, as originally pronounced,

<i>Scotland</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SNITCHERS</span> signify handcuffs.</p>

<p><b><a id="Snob"></a>Snob</b>, a low, vulgar, or affected person. Supposed to be from the nickname
usually applied to a cobbler or maker of shoes; but believed by
many in its later sense to be a contraction of the <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SINE OBOLO</span>.
Others go to work for an etymology thus:&mdash;They assume that <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBS</span>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>nobiles</i>, was appended in lists to the names of persons of gentle
birth, whilst those who had not that distinction were marked down as
<span class="smcap lowercase">S NOB</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>sine nobilitate</i>, without marks of gentility,&mdash;thus, by a
simple transposition, quite reversing the meaning. Others, again,
remark that, as at college sons of noblemen wrote after their names in
the admission lists, <i>fil. nob.</i>, son of a lord, and hence all young noblemen
were called <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBS</span>, and what they did <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBBY</span>, so those who imitated
them would be called <i>quasi-nobs</i>, “like a nob,” which by a
process of contraction would be shortened to <i>si-nob</i>, and then <span class="smcap lowercase">SNOB</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
one who pretends to be what he is not, and apes his betters. The
short and expressive terms which many think fitly represent the three
great estates of the realm&mdash;<span class="smcap lowercase">NOB</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SNOB</span>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">MOB</span>&mdash;were all originally
slang words. The last has safely passed through the vulgar ordeal of
the streets, and found respectable quarters in the standard dictionaries.
For fuller particulars of the genus <span class="smcap lowercase">SNOB</span>, in all its ramifications, the
reader cannot do better than apply to the general works of that great
master of the subject, William Makepeace Thackeray, though it may
be as well to remark that the <span class="smcap lowercase">SNOB</span> for whom the novelist had such an
aversion is now very widely known as “cad.”</p>

<p><b>Snobbish</b>, stuck up, proud, make-believe.</p>

<p><b>Snob-Stick</b>, a workman who refuses to join in strikes, or trade-unions.
Amplification of <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Knobstick">KNOB-STICK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Snooks</b>, an imaginary personage often brought forward as the answer to an
idle question, or as the perpetrator of a senseless joke. Said to be simply
a shortening or abbreviation of “Sevenoaks,” the Kentish village.</p>

<p><b>Snooze</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SNOODGE</span> (vulgar pronunciation), to sleep or doze.</p>

<p><b>Snooze-case</b>, a pillow-slip.</p>

<p><b>Snorter</b>, a blow on the nose. A hurry is sometimes called a “reg’lar
<span class="smcap lowercase">SNORTER</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Snot</b>, a term of reproach applied to persons by the vulgar when vexed or
annoyed, meaning really a person of the vilest description and meanest
capacity. In a Westminster school vocabulary for boys, published
in the last century, the term is curiously applied. Its proper meaning
is the glandular mucus discharged through the nose.</p>

<p><b>Snot</b>, a small bream, a slimy kind of flat fish.&mdash;<i>Norwich.</i></p>

<p><b>Snotter</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">WIPE-HAULER</span>, a pickpocket whose chief fancy is for gentlemen’s
pocket-handkerchiefs.&mdash;<i>North.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Snottinger"></a>Snottinger</b>, a coarse word for a pocket-handkerchief. The German
<i>Schnupftuch</i> is, however, nearly as plain. A handkerchief was also
anciently called a “muckinger” or “<a href="#Muckender">muckender</a>,” and from that a
neckerchief was called a “neckinger.”</p>

<p><b>Snow</b>, wet linen, or linen hung out to dry.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Snow-gatherer</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SNOW-DROPPER</span>, a rogue who steals linen from
hedges and drying-grounds.</p>

<p><b>Snuff</b>, “up to <span class="smcap lowercase">SNUFF</span>,” knowing and sharp; “to take <span class="smcap lowercase">SNUFF</span>,” to be
offended. Shakspeare uses <span class="smcap lowercase">SNUFF</span> in the sense of anger, or passion.</p>

<p><b>Snuff it</b>, to die. Term very common among the lower orders of London.
A fanciful variation of “putting one’s light out,” and used simply in
reference to the action of the person dying. Thus any one threatening
to murder another says, “I’ll put your light out,” or any one committing
suicide is said to “put his own light out;” but to “<span class="smcap lowercase">SNUFF IT</span>” is
always to die from disease or accident. To “lay down one’s knife
and fork,” to “peg out,” or “give up,” are variations of this form of
euphemism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Snuffy</b>, tipsy, drunk.</p>

<p><b>Sober-water</b>, a jocular allusion to the uses of soda-water.</p>

<p><b>Social evil</b>, a name for some years applied to our street-walking system,
in consequence of the articles in the newspapers which treat on the evils
of prostitution being so headed. A good story has been often told on
this subject, which will bear repeating:&mdash;“A well-known divine and
philanthropist was walking in a crowded street at night in order to
distribute tracts to promising subjects. A young woman was walking
up and down, and he accosted her. He pointed out to her the error
of her ways, implored her to reform, and tendered her a tract with
fervent entreaties to go home and read it. The girl stared at him for
a moment or two in sheer bewilderment; at last it dawned on her
what he meant, and for what he took her, and looking up in his face
with simple amazement, she exclaimed, ‘Lor’ bless you, sir, I ain’t a
<span class="smcap lowercase">SOCIAL EVIL</span>; I’m waitin’ for the ’bus!’” The enthusiasm which was
felt in this direction a few years back has received considerable modification,
as it has been proved that the efforts of the promoters of midnight
meetings and other arrangements of a similar nature, praiseworthy
though they are, have little or no effect; and that the early-closing
movement in the Haymarket has done more to stamp out the <span class="smcap lowercase">SOCIAL
EVIL</span> than years of preaching, even when accompanied by tea and
buns, could ever have done.</p>

<p><b>Sock</b>, the Eton College term for a treat, synonymous with “chuck” used
at Westminster and other schools. Believed to be derived from the
monkish word <span class="smcap lowercase">SOKE</span>. An old writer speaks of a pious man “who did
not <span class="smcap lowercase">SOKE</span> for three days,” meaning that he fasted. The word is still used
by the boys of Heriot’s Hospital School at Edinburgh, and signifies a
sweetmeat; being derived from the same source as sugar, <i>suck</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SUCRE</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Sock</b>, credit. As, “He gets his goods on <span class="smcap lowercase">SOCK</span>, while I pay ready.”</p>

<p><b>Socket-money</b>, money extorted by threats of exposure. To be applied
to for <span class="smcap lowercase">SOCKET-MONEY</span> is perhaps one of the most terrible inflictions

called, should be punished with the utmost possible severity.</p>

deeply in love. “I see, it’s a case of <span class="smcap lowercase">SPOONS</span> with them,” is a common
phrase when lovers are mentioned.</p>

<p><b><a id="Spoons"></a>Spoons</b>, a method of designating large sums of money, disclosed at the
Bankruptcy Court during the examination of the great leather failures
of Streatfield and Laurence in 1860-61. The origin of the phrase was
stated to be the reply of the bankrupt Laurence to an offer of accommodating
him with £5000,&mdash;“Oh, you are feeding me with a <span class="smcap lowercase">TEA-SPOON</span>.”
Hence, £5000 came to be known in the firm as a <span class="smcap lowercase">TEA-SPOON</span>;
£10,000, a <span class="smcap lowercase">DESSERT-SPOON</span>; £15,000, a <span class="smcap lowercase">TABLE-SPOON</span>; and £20,000,
as a <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAVY-SPOON</span>. The public were amused at this <span class="smcap lowercase">TEA-SPOON</span>
phraseology, but were disgusted that such levity should cover a gigantic
swindle of the kind. It came out in evidence, however, that it was
not the ordinary slang of the discount world, but it may not improbably
become so. To “take it with a <span class="smcap lowercase">SPOON</span>,” is to take anything in
small quantities. The counsel for the defence in the Tichborne
perjury case was reminded a short time back by one of the judges that
he was using a <span class="smcap lowercase">TEA-SPOON</span> instead of a shovel, to clear through the
evidence.</p>

evenness and rectitude.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

tried too many of the “hairs of the dog that bit him.” If this state of
things is long continued, it is often called “same <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD DRUNK</span>,” from
a well-known nigger story. The nigger was cautioned by his master
for being too often drunk within a given period, when the “cullud
pusson” replied, “Same old drunk, massa&mdash;same old drunk.”</p>

<p><b>Stalking-horse</b>, originally a horse covered with loose trappings, under
which the mediæval sportsman concealed himself with his bow, so as
to approach his game unobserved. Subsequently a canvas figure, made
light, so as to be easily moved with one hand. Now used to represent
any bugbear persistently paraded; any constant and unpleasant reference
to the possible consequences of an act.</p>

<p><b>Stall</b>, to lodge, or put up at a public-house. Also, to act a part.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Stall</b>, to frighten or discourage. In the days of dog-fighting and pugilism,
a dog or man who had originally shown great pluck would, after a hard

<p><b>Star</b>, a common abbreviation of the name of the well-known <span class="smcap">Star and
Garter</span> Inn at Richmond. Clever people, who delight in altering
names, call this hostelry the “Gar and Starter.”</p>

<p><b>Star it</b>, to perform as the centre of attraction, with inferior subordinates
to set off one’s abilities.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Star the glaze</b>, to break a window. Among thieves it means to break
the window or show-glass of a jeweller or other tradesman, take any
valuable articles, and run away. Sometimes the glass is cut with a
diamond, and a strip of leather fastened to the piece of glass cut out
to keep it from falling in and making a noise. Another plan is to cut
the sash.</p>

<p><b>Starchy</b>, stuck-up, high-notioned, showily dressed, stiff and unbending

<p><b>Start</b>, a proceeding of any kind; “a rum <span class="smcap lowercase">START</span>,” an odd circumstance;
“to get the <span class="smcap lowercase">START</span> of a person,” to anticipate or overreach him.</p>

<p><b>Starvation</b>, though now a recognised word, was originally slang. Its
derivation is composite, and it was first introduced into the English
language by Mr. Dundas, in a debate in the House of Commons on
American affairs, in 1775. “I shall not,” he said, “wait for the
advent of <span class="smcap lowercase">STARVATION</span> from Edinburgh to settle my judgment.” From
this he was always afterwards called <span class="smcap">Starvation</span> Dundas.&mdash;<i>Horace
Walpole’s Letters.</i></p>

<p><b>Starve’em</b>, <b>Rob’em</b>, and <b>Cheat’em</b>, the adjoining towns of Stroud,
Rochester, and Chatham are so designated by soldiers and sailors;
from some fancied peculiarities of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><b><a id="Stash"></a>Stash</b>, to cease doing anything, to refrain, be quiet, leave off; “<span class="smcap lowercase">STASH</span> it,

course of life is to <span class="smcap lowercase">STASH</span> it.</p>

<p><b>Stay</b>, to exhibit powers of endurance at walking, running, rowing, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Stayer</b>, one likely to persevere, one not easily discouraged. It is usual
for <i>laudatores temporis acti</i> connected with the turf to deplore the want
of staying power which, according to their statements, characterizes
the modern British racehorse; while others, connected and disconnected
with sport, make similar remarks with reference to the modern
British man. So far, however, both descriptions of old gentlemen
have failed signally in endeavouring to make out a good case.</p>

<p><b>Steam-engine</b>, potato-pie at Manchester is so termed.</p>

<p><b><a id="Steel"></a>Steel</b>, the House of Correction in London, formerly named the Bastile, but

a curious man. More generally a “poor <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span>.”&mdash;<i>Provincial.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Stick"></a>Stick</b>, “cut your <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span>,” be off, or go away; either simply equivalent to
a recommendation to prepare a walking staff in readiness for a journey&mdash;in
allusion to the Eastern custom of cutting a <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span> before setting
out&mdash;or from the ancient mode of reckoning by notches or tallies on a
<span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span>. In Cornwall the peasantry tally sheaves of corn by cuts in a
<span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span>, reckoning by the score. “Cut your <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span>” in this sense may
mean to make your mark and pass on&mdash;and so realize the meaning of
the phrase, “in the nick (or notch) of time.” Sir J. Emerson Tennent
considers the phrase equivalent to “cutting the connexion,” and suggests
a possible origin in the prophet’s breaking the staves of “Beauty”
and “Bands,”&mdash;<i>vide</i> Zech. xi. 10, 14.</p>

<p><b>Stick</b>, to cheat; “he got <span class="smcap lowercase">STUCK</span>,” he was taken in; “I’m <span class="smcap lowercase">STUCK</span>,” a

part in a performance.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i> <span class="smcap">Stick</span> up, to place in an account;

slandered in his absence; <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span> up to, to persevere in courting
or attacking, whether in fisticuffs or argument; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span> in one’s
gizzard,” to rankle in one’s heart; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span> to a person,” to adhere
to one, to be his friend through adverse circumstances,&mdash;to “cotton”
to him; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">STICK</span> one’s spoon in the wall,” to die.</p>

<p><b>Stick-up</b>, to keep any one waiting at an appointed place or time. To
leave a friend or acquaintance to pay the whole or an undue share of a

hard?” <i>i.e.</i>, did he pay you cash or give a bill? “To do a bit of <span class="smcap lowercase">STIFF</span>,”
to accept a bill. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Kite">KITE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Stiff-fencer</b>, a street-seller of writing paper.</p>

<p><b>Stiff un</b>, a corpse. Term used by undertakers.</p>

<p><b>Stills</b>, undertakers’ slang term for <span class="smcap lowercase">STILL-BORN</span> children. The fee paid
by nurses and others for their disposal is usually 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> A separate
coffin is never given; the <span class="smcap lowercase">STILLS</span> are quietly introduced into one containing
an adult about to be buried. <span class="smcap">Stills</span> are allowed to accumulate
at an undertaker’s until they sometimes number as many as a dozen.
Some little time back a very bulky coffin was opened, and found to contain
a large quantity of small corpses packed carefully round a large corpse.
This caused a little excitement, but nothing was done in the matter.</p>

<p><b>Stilton</b>, “that’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">STILTON</span>,” or “it’s not the <span class="smcap lowercase">STILTON</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>

<p><b>Stingo</b>, strong liquor.&mdash;<i>Yorkshire.</i></p>

<p><b>Stink</b>, a disagreeable exposure. “To stir up a <span class="smcap lowercase">STINK</span>” is to make a disclosure
which is generally unpleasant in its effect.</p>

<p><b>Stinkomalee</b>, a name given to the then New London University by
Theodore Hook. Probably because some cow-houses and dunghills
stood on the original site. Some question about Trincomalee was
agitated at the same time. It is still applied by the students of the
old Universities, who regard it with disfavour from its admitting all
denominations.</p>

<p><b>Stipe</b>, a stipendiary magistrate.&mdash;<i>Provincial.</i></p>

<p><b>Stir</b>, a prison, a lock-up; “in <span class="smcap lowercase">STIR</span>,” in gaol. <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">STYR</span>, correction,
punishment.</p>

<p><b>Stir-up Sunday</b>, the Sunday next before Advent, the collect for that
day commencing with the words, “Stir up.” Schoolboys, growing
excited at the prospect of the vacation, irreverently commemorate it
by stirring up&mdash;pushing and poking each other. “Crib-crust Monday”
and “tug-button Tuesday” are distinguished by similar tricks; while
on “pay-off Wednesday” they retaliate small grudges in a playful
facetious way. Forby says good housewives in Norfolk consider themselves
reminded by the name to mix the ingredients for their Christmas
mince-pies.</p>

<p><b>Stock.</b> “To <span class="smcap lowercase">STOCK</span> cards” is to arrange cards in a certain manner for
cheating purposes.</p>

bread and milk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In a box of the stone-jug I was born.”</p></div>

who takes pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><b>Story</b>, a falsehood,&mdash;the soft synonym for a lie, allowed in family circles
and boarding-schools. A Puritanism that came into fashion with the
tirade against romances, all novels and stories being considered as
dangerous and false.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Stow</b>, to leave off, or have done; “<span class="smcap lowercase">STOW</span> it, the gorger’s leary.” Leave

Cant.</i></p>

word <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Neat">NEAT</a></span>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p><b>Strap</b>, a barber. From <i>Roderick Random</i>.</p>

<p><b>Straw.</b> Married ladies are said to be “in the <span class="smcap lowercase">STRAW</span>” at their accouchements.
The phrase is a coarse metaphor, and has reference to farmyard
animals in a similar condition. It may have originally been
suggested to the inquiring mind by the Nativity.</p>

<p><b>Strawing</b>, “selling” straws in the streets (generally for a penny), and
“giving” the purchaser a paper (indecent or political) or a gold (!)
ring,&mdash;neither of which, the patterer states, he is allowed by Act of
Parliament to sell.</p>

<p><b><a id="Streak"></a>Streak</b>, to decamp, run away.&mdash;<i>Saxon.</i> In America the phrase is “to
make <span class="smcap lowercase">STREAKS</span>,” or “make <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Tracks">TRACKS</a></span>.”</p>

<p><b>Streaky</b>, irritated, ill-tempered. Said of a short-tempered man who has
his good and bad times in <span class="smcap lowercase">STREAK</span>.</p>

<p><b>Street-pitchers</b>, negro minstrels, ballad-singers, long-song men, men
“working a board” on which have been painted various exciting
scenes in some terrible drama, the details of which the <span class="smcap lowercase">STREET PITCHER</span>
is bawling out, and selling in a little book or broadsheet (price one
penny); or any persons who make a stand&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a pitch&mdash;in the streets,
and sell articles or contribute entertainments for a living.</p>

<p><b>Stretch,</b> a walk.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Stretch</b>, abbreviation of “<span class="smcap lowercase">STRETCH</span> one’s neck,” to hang, to be executed
as a malefactor. As, “The night before Larry was <span class="smcap lowercase">STRETCHED</span>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Stretch"></a>Stretch</b>, twelve months,&mdash;generally used to intimate the time any one
has been sentenced by the judge or magistrate. One <span class="smcap lowercase">STRETCH</span> is twelve
months’ imprisonment, two <span class="smcap lowercase">STRETCH</span> is two years, three <span class="smcap lowercase">STRETCH</span> is
three years, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Stretcher</b>, a falsehood; one that requires a <span class="smcap lowercase">STRETCH</span> of imagination or

<div>
<p><b>Strike me lucky!</b> an expression used by the lower orders when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
making a bargain, derived from the old custom of striking hands together,
leaving in that of the seller a <span class="smcap lowercase">LUCK PENNY</span> as an earnest that
the bargain is concluded. In Ireland, at cattle markets, &amp;c., a penny,
or other small coin, is always given by the buyer to the seller to ratify
the bargain.&mdash;<i>Hudibras.</i> Anciently this was called a “God’s penny.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“With that he cast him a God’s penny.”&mdash;<i>Heir of Linne.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The origin of the phrase being lost sight of, like that of many others,
it is often used as a modification of “Strike me blind!” and is now and
again corrupted into “Strike me silly!” A foolish variation of this is
“Strike me up a gum-tree!”</p>
</div>


<p><b>Strills</b>, cheating lies.&mdash;<i>North Country Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>String</b>, to hoax, to “get in a line.”</p>

<p><b>Stroke</b>, the captain of a crew, the man who sets the pace, and is generally
the leading spirit in the boat. The coxswain usually looks after
University men when they are in training, so that they may not fall
into excesses, the <span class="smcap lowercase">STROKE</span> having quite enough to do to attend to his
own training. Of late years University crews have placed themselves
under the guidance and tuition of “coaches,” generally ex-University
men of great ability and experience.</p>

<p><b>Strommel</b>, straw.&mdash;<i>Ancient Cant.</i> Halliwell says that in Norfolk
<span class="smcap lowercase">STRUMMEL</span> is a name for hair.</p>

<p><b>Strong</b>, “to come it <span class="smcap lowercase">STRONG</span>.” <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Come">COME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Stuck</b>, moneyless. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Stick">STICK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Stuck-up</b>, purse-proud&mdash;a form of snobbishness very common in those
who have risen in the world, especially among those who have risen
rather suddenly. Albert Smith wrote some amusing papers on the
<i>Natural History of <span class="smcap lowercase">STUCK-UP</span> People</i>.</p>

<p><b>Stuff</b>, money.</p>

<p><b>Stuff</b>, to make false but plausible statements, to praise ironically, to make
game of a person,&mdash;literally, to <span class="smcap lowercase">STUFF</span> or cram him with gammon or
falsehood.</p>

<p><b>Stump</b>, to go on foot.</p>

<p><b>Stump</b>, to go about speechmaking on politics or other subjects. Originally
an Americanism applied to the lowest class of candidates for
legislatorial honours, probably because they stood on a <span class="smcap lowercase">STUMP</span> to address
their audiences. Maybe, also, because their utterances were short
and pithy. This latter reason would, however, hardly apply to our
representatives of the <span class="smcap lowercase">STUMP</span> class, “the Leaguers,” who are, as a
rule, as long-winded as they are illogical.</p>

<p><b>Stump up</b>, to give one’s share, to pay the reckoning, to bring forth the
money reluctantly.</p>

<p><b>Stumped</b>, bowled out, done for, bankrupt, poverty-stricken. From the
cricketing term.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Stunners</b>, feelings of great astonishment; “it put the <span class="smcap lowercase">STUNNERS</span> on
me,” <i>i.e.</i>, it confounded me.</p>

<p><b>Stunning</b>, first-rate, very good, really, astonishing. Costermongers call
anything extra good, <span class="smcap lowercase">STUNNING</span>. Sometimes amplified to <span class="smcap">stunning
Joe Banks</span>! when the expression is supposed to be in its most intense
form. Joe Banks was a noted character in the last generation. He
was the proprietor of a public-house in Dyott Street, Seven Dials, and
afterwards, on the demolition of the Rookery, of another in Cranbourn
Alley. His houses became well-known from their being the
resort of the worst characters, while at the same time the strictest decorum
was always maintained in them. Joe Banks also acquired a
remarkable notoriety by acting as a medium betwixt thieves and their
victims. Upon the proper payment to Joe, a watch or a snuff-box
would at any time be restored to its lawful owner&mdash;“no questions in
any case being asked.” The most daring depredators in London
placed the fullest confidence in Joe, and it is believed (although the
<i>Biographie Universelle</i> is quiet upon this point) that he never, in any
instance, “sold” them. He was of the middle height, stout, and
strongly made, and was always noted for a showy pin and a remarkably
<span class="smcap lowercase">STUNNING</span> neck-tie. It was this peculiarity in the costume of
Mr. Banks, coupled with those true and tried qualities as a friend for
which he was famous, that led his customers to proclaim him as
<span class="smcap">stunningJoe Banks</span>! The Marquis of Douro, Colonel Chatterley,
and men of their stamp, were accustomed to resort to a private-room
at his house, when too late (or too early) to gain admittance to the clubs
or more aristocratic establishments.</p>

<p><b>Sub</b>, a subaltern officer in the army.</p>

<p><b>Sub</b>, all.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

<p><b>Sub</b>, to draw money in advance; a term in use among workmen generally,
and those with casual employment in particular. Most likely from

<p><b>Sublime rascal</b>, a lawyer.</p>

<p><b>Suck</b>, a parasite, a flatterer of the “nobs.”&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b>Suck</b>, to pump, or draw information from a person.</p>

<p><b>Suck-casa</b>, a public-house.&mdash;<i>Lingua Franca.</i></p>

<p><b>Suck the mop</b>, to be the victim of an omnibus nursing exploit. When
an omnibus is being nursed, the driver of the hindmost vehicle keeps
so close to his opponent that the horses get their heads almost into the
doorway. The nursed omnibus is then said to <span class="smcap lowercase">SUCK THE MOP</span>.
Nursing is, thanks to tramways and the Metropolis Streets Act, almost
a thing of the past. At the East-end, however, it still goes merrily on.</p>

<p><b>Suck the monkey</b>, to rob a cask of liquor by inserting a straw through
a gimlet-hole, and sucking a portion of the contents. Originally, as
Captain Marryatt states, to <span class="smcap lowercase">SUCK THE MONKEY</span>, was to suck rum from
cocoa-nuts, which spirit had been inserted in place of the milk, for the
private use of the sailors. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Tap_the_Admiral">TAP THE ADMIRAL</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="Suck_up"></a>Suck up</b>, “to <span class="smcap lowercase">SUCK UP</span> to a person,” to insinuate oneself into his good
graces.</p>

<p><b><a id="Sudden_death"></a>Sudden death.</b> In tossing, to be decided by the first call is to “<span class="smcap lowercase">GO
SUDDEN DEATH</span>,” as distinguished from the longer forms of “best

or Sally Lunn, is so called.</p>

<p><b>Sufferer</b>, a tailor; the loser at any game.</p>

<p><b>Sugar</b>, money.</p>

<p><b>Supe</b>, or super, abbreviation of <span class="smcap lowercase">SUPERNUMERARY</span>.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i></p>

<p><b>Super</b>, a watch; <span class="smcap lowercase">SUPER-SCREWING</span>, stealing watches.</p>

<p><b>Surat</b>, an adulterated article of inferior quality. This word affords a
remarkable instance of the manner in which slang phrases are coined.
In the report of an action for libel in the <i>Times</i>, some few years back,
it was stated “that, since the American civil war, it has been not unusual
for manufacturers to mix American cotton with surat, and, the
latter being an inferior article, the people in Lancashire have begun to
apply the term <span class="smcap lowercase">SURAT</span> to any article of inferior or adulterated quality.
The plaintiffs were brewers, and the action was brought to recover
special damages resulting from the publication of an advertisement in
these words:&mdash;‘All in want of beerhouses must beware of Beaumont
and White, the <span class="smcap lowercase">SURAT</span> brewers.’”</p>

<p><b>Surf</b>, an actor who frequently pursues another calling.&mdash;<i>Theatrical.</i>
<span class="smcap">Surf</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SERF</span>, is also a term much in use among the lower orders to
denote a crawling or sycophantic wretch.</p>

<p><b>Suspicion</b>, a scarcely perceptible flavour; as, “There was just a <span class="smcap lowercase">SUSPICION</span>
of oil in the mixture.” <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SOUPÇON</span>.</p>

<p><b>Swab</b>, an epaulet.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Swack-up</b>, a falsehood.</p>

<p><b>Swaddler</b>, a Wesleyan Methodist; a name originally given to members
of that body by the Irish mob; said to have originated with an
ignorant Romanist, to whom the words of the English Bible were a
novelty, and who, hearing one of John Wesley’s preachers mention the
swaddling clothes of the Holy Infant, in a sermon on Christmas-day
at Dublin, shouted out in derision, “A <span class="smcap lowercase">SWADDLER</span>! a <span class="smcap lowercase">SWADDLER</span>!” as
if the whole story were the preacher’s invention.&mdash;<i>Southey’s Life of
Wesley</i>, vol. ii. p. 109. <i>See</i> <a href="#swaddler">introductory article</a>.</p>

<p><b>Swaddler</b>, <i>see</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Souper">SOUPER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Swaddy</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">COOLIE</span>, a soldier. The former was originally applied to a
discharged soldier, and perhaps came from <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Shoddy">SHODDY</a></span>, which is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
from soldiers’ and policemen’s worn-out coats. The term was one of
opprobrium, and was probably the result of a long peace, for it became
obsolete as soon as the Crimean War commenced.</p>

<p><b>Swag</b>, a lot or plenty of anything, a portion or division of property. In
Australia the term is used for the luggage carried by diggers. <i>Scotch</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SWEG</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SWACK</span>; <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SWEIG</span>, a flock. Old cant for a shop.</p>

<p><b>Swag-shop</b>, a warehouse where “Brummagem” and general wares,
fancy trinkets, plated goods, &amp;c., are sold. Jews are the general proprietors;
and the goods are very low-priced, trashy, and showy.
<span class="smcap">Swag-shops</span> were formerly plunder depôts.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Swagsman</b>, one who carries the booty after a burglary.</p>

<p><b>Swank</b>, to boast or “gas” unduly.</p>

<p><b>Swankey</b>, cheap or small beer. Any weak fermented beverage.</p>

<p><b>Swap</b>, to exchange. Grose says it is Irish cant, but the term is now included
in most dictionaries as an allowed vulgarism.</p>

<p><b>Swarry</b>, a boiled leg of mutton and trimmings. Sam Weller’s adventure
with the Bath footmen originated the term. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Trimmings">TRIMMINGS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Swatchel-cove"></a>Swatchel-cove</b>, the master of a Punch-and-Judy exhibition who
“fakes the slum,” and does the necessary squeak for the amusement of
the bystanders. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Schwassle_box">Schwassle box</a></span>. The orthography of many of
these colloquial expressions differs. It was thought best to give the
various renderings as collected.</p>

<p><b>Sweat</b>, to extract money from a person, to “bleed.” Also, to squander
riches.&mdash;<i>Bulwer.</i></p>

<p><b>Sweat</b>, to violently shake up a lot of guineas or sovereigns in a leathern
bag for the purpose of benefiting by the perspiration.</p>

<p><b>Sweetener</b>, a person who runs up the prices of articles at an auction.
<i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Jolly">JOLLYING</a></span>, <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Bonnet">BONNET</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Swell</b>, a man of importance; a person with a showy, jaunty exterior, “a
rank <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELL</span>,” a very flashily dressed person, a man who by excessive
dress apes a higher position than he actually occupies. Any one occupying
a superior position in society is by the mob called a <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELL</span>.
Anything is said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELL</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLISH</span> that looks showy, or is
many coloured, or is of a desirable quality. Dickens and Thackeray
were termed great <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLS</span> in literature, and so are the first persons in
the learned professions <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLS</span> in their way.</p>

<p><b>Swell hung in chains</b>, said of a showy man in the habit of wearing
much jewellery.</p>

<p><b>Swell street</b>, the West-end of London.</p>

has possibly been derived.&mdash;<i>Norfolk.</i></p>

<p><b>Swim</b>, “a good <span class="smcap lowercase">SWIM</span>,” a good run of luck, a long time out of the policeman’s
clutches.&mdash;<i>Thieves’ term.</i> Among anglers “a good <span class="smcap lowercase">SWIM</span>” is a
good pitch for a part where fish are plentiful&mdash;that is, because a lot of
fish keeping together are called a <span class="smcap lowercase">SWIM</span>. Thus one who is in luck, is well
connected, or is doing a good business, is said to be in a good <span class="smcap lowercase">SWIM</span>.</p>

<p><b>Swindler</b>, although a recognised word in standard dictionaries, commenced
service as a slang term. It was used as such by the poor
Londoners against the German Jews who set up in London about the
year 1762, also by our soldiers in the German war about that time.
<span class="smcap">Schwindeln</span>, in <i>German</i>, signifies to cheat.</p>

<p><b>Swipey</b> (from <span class="smcap lowercase">SWIPES</span>), intoxicated.</p>

<p><b>Swished</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SWITCHED</span>, married.</p>

<p><b>Swivel-eye</b>, a squinting eye.</p>

<p><b>Swizzle</b>, small beer, drink.</p>

<p><b>Swot</b>, mathematics; also, a mathematician; as a verb, to work hard for
an examination, to be diligent in one’s studies.&mdash;<i>Army.</i></p>

<p>This word originated at the great slang manufactory for the army,
the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in the broad Scotch pronunciation
by Dr. Wallace, one of the Professors, of the word sweat. It
has since become fashionable at the Universities.</p>

<p><b>Syce</b>, a groom.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

</div>
<div class="section">

In America, a gathering of men only is called a “stag

<p><b>Tack</b>, a taste foreign to what was intended; a barrel may get a <span class="smcap lowercase">TACK</span>
upon it, either permanently mouldy, sour, or otherwise.</p>

<p><b>Tacked</b>, tied down. When a man has another vanquished, or for certain
reasons bound to his service, he is said to have “got him <span class="smcap lowercase">TACKED</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Tackle</b>, clothes.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i> Also to encounter a person in argument.</p>

<p><b>Taffy</b> (corruption of David), a Welshman. Compare Sawney (from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>

get his <span class="smcap lowercase">TAIL DOWN</span>. “His <span class="smcap lowercase">TAIL</span> was quite <span class="smcap lowercase">DOWN</span>, and it was all over.”
The origin is obvious.</p>

<p><b>Take</b>, to succeed, or be patronized. “Do you think the new opera will
<span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span>?” “No, because the same company <span class="smcap lowercase">TOOK</span> so badly under the
old management.” “To <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> on,” to grieve; Shakspeare uses the
word <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKING</span> in this sense. To “<span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> up for any one,” to protect
or defend a person; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> off,” to mimic; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> heart,” to

“to <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> up,” to reprove; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> after,” to resemble; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span>
in,” to cheat or defraud, probably from the lower class lodging-house-keepers’
advertisements, “Single men <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKEN</span> in and done for,”&mdash;an
engagement which is as frequently performed in a bad as a good sense;
in reference to this performance, Scripture is often quoted: “I was a
stranger and ye <span class="smcap lowercase">TOOK</span> me in.” “To <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> the field,” when said of a
general, to commence operations against the enemy. When a racing
man <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKES</span> the field he stakes his money against the favourite, that is,
he takes the chances of the field against the chance of one horse.</p>

<p><b>Take beef</b>, to run away.</p>

<p><b>Take in</b>, a cheating or swindling transaction,&mdash;sometimes termed “a
dead <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE IN</span>.” Shakspeare has <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE IN</span> in the sense of conquering.
To be “had,” or to be “spoken to,” were formerly synonymous phrases
with to be <span class="smcap lowercase">TAKEN IN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Take it out</b>, to obtain value for money, labour, &amp;c. A rich man is said

A poor man “<span class="smcap lowercase">TAKES IT</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, his trouble) <span class="smcap lowercase">OUT</span> in drink.”</p>

are addicted to <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Roarer">ROARING</a></span>. <i>See</i> the latter expression.</p>

<p><b>Talk shop</b>, to intrude oneself or one’s private business too freely into
conversation. Any one who does this is said to be shoppy.</p>

<p><b>Tall</b>, extensive, exaggerated,&mdash;generally applied to conversation, as “loud”
is to dress, or personal appearance; “<span class="smcap lowercase">TALL</span> talk that,” <i>i.e.</i>, conversation
too boastful or high-flown to be true. Among pedestrians a great
rate of speed is spoken of as <span class="smcap lowercase">TALL</span>.</p>

<p><b>Tally</b>, five dozen bunches of turnips.&mdash;<i>Costermongers’ term.</i></p>

<p><b>Tally</b>, “to live <span class="smcap lowercase">TALLY</span>,” to live in a state of unmarried impropriety; <span class="smcap lowercase">TALLY-WIFE</span>,
a woman who cohabits with a man to whom she is not married.</p>

<p><b>Tallyman</b>, an accommodating salesman who takes payment by instalments
to suit the convenience of the purchaser, but who is anything but
accommodating when payments are irregular. <span class="smcap">Tallymen</span> are the
cause of much misfortune to the working classes, from their high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
exorbitant rates, and the temptations they offer to weak-minded
women, who purchase in haste and repent at leisure.</p>

beating.</p>

<p><b>Tan</b>, an order to pull.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian.</i></p>

tarantula in Italy.&mdash;<i>Penny Cyclopædia.</i></p>

<p><b>Tantrums</b>, ill-tempers. “He’s in his <span class="smcap lowercase">TANTRUMS</span> this morning,” is often
said of a peevish, querulous man. They are not peculiar to the one
sex, however.</p>

<p><b><a id="Tap_the_Admiral"></a>Tap the Admiral</b>, to suck liquor from a cask by means of a straw,
said to have been done with the rum-cask in which Lord Nelson’s body
was brought to England, to such an extent as to leave the gallant
Admiral dry.</p>

<p><b>Tap-tub</b>, the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>,&mdash;so called by vulgar people from the

brewers and publicans. Sometimes termed the <i>Gin and Gospel Gazette</i>,
though this title is fast fading out since the paper has been in the hands
of its present editor.</p>

<p><b>Tape</b>, gin,&mdash;term with female servants. Also, a military term used in

<p><b>Taradiddle</b>, a falsehood.</p>

<p><b>Tar-brush</b>, a person whose complexion indicates a mixture of negro
blood, is said to have had a lick of the <span class="smcap lowercase">TAR-BRUSH</span>. Sometimes a
man of this description is said to have been dipped in the black-pot,
and he is often reminded that “another dip would have done it,” <i>i.e.</i>,
another dip would have made a negro of him.</p>

<p><b>Tar-out</b>, to punish, to serve out.</p>

<p><b>Tarpaulin</b>, a sailor.</p>

<p><b>Tartar</b>, a savage fellow, an “ugly customer.” To “catch a <span class="smcap">Tartar</span>,”
is to discover somewhat unpleasantly that a person is by no means so
mild or good-tempered as he or she at first appeared.</p>

<p><b>Tat-box</b>, a dice-box.</p>

<p><b>Tater</b>, “s’elp my <span class="smcap lowercase">TATER</span>,” an evasion of a profane oath, sometimes varied

<p><b>Teddy Hall</b>, St. Edmund Hall.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>Teetotaller</b>, a total abstainer from alcoholic drinks. The origin of this

and stuttering enthusiast in the cause of total abstinence. It has nothing
to do with tea.</p>

<p><b>Teetotally</b>, amplification of <span class="smcap lowercase">TOTALLY</span>.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Te-he</b>, to titter, “Upon this I <span class="smcap lowercase">TE-HE’D</span>.”&mdash;<i>Madame d’Arblay.</i> As an

<p><b>Tell on</b>, to tell about, to talk of, to inform against. (This is formed
by a simple misuse of the preposition.)</p>

<p><b>Ten commandments</b>, a virago’s fingers, or nails. Often heard in a
female street disturbance. “I’ll leave the <span class="smcap lowercase">TEN COMMANDMENTS</span>
marked on his chump,” shows that the term may be applied to either
the fingers or the scratchings. It would be a strange hand, however,
that, with the best opportunity, could made five marks simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Tench</b>, the Penitentiary, of which it is a contraction. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Steel">STEEL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Tenpence to the shilling</b>, a vulgar phrase denoting a deficiency in
intellect.</p>

<p><b>Testamur</b>, the slip of paper on which the examiners testify (testari)
to the fact that the candidate has satisfied their requirements.&mdash;<i>University.</i></p>

<p><b><a id="Tester"></a>Tester</b>, sixpence. From <span class="smcap lowercase">TESTONE</span>, a shilling in the reign of Henry VIII.,
but a sixpence in the time of Queen Elizabeth.&mdash;<i>Shakspeare.</i> <i>French</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">TESTE</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">TÊTE</span>, the head of the monarch on the coin.</p>

<p><b>Teviss</b>, a shilling. Costermongers’ and tramps’ term.</p>

<p><b>Thatch</b>, the human hair. “He’s well <span class="smcap lowercase">THATCHED</span>,” is said of a man
with a good head of hair.</p>

<p><b>The Tavern</b>, New Inn Hall.&mdash;<i>Oxford University.</i></p>

<p><b>The thing</b>, the style, the proper proportion. Application varied. A
good appearance, a decent dinner, or a fair bottle of wine, is said to be
“the <span class="smcap lowercase">THING</span>,” sometimes “the correct <span class="smcap lowercase">THING</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Thick</b>, intimate, familiar. The Scotch use the word “chief” in this
sense, as, “the two are very chief now.”</p>

<p><b>Thick;</b> “to lay it on <span class="smcap lowercase">THICK</span>,” to flatter unduly, to surfeit with praise or
adulation.</p>

<p><b>Thick un</b>, a sovereign; originally a crown piece, or five shillings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Thimble</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">YACK</span>, a watch.&mdash;<i>Prison Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Thimble-rig</b>, a noted cheating game some years back, played at fairs
and places of great public thronging, consisting of two or three thimbles
rapidly and dexterously placed over a pea. The <span class="smcap lowercase">THIMBLE-RIGGER</span>,
suddenly ceasing, asks under which thimble the pea is to be found.
Any one not a practised hand would lose nine times out of ten any bet
he might happen to make with him. The pea is generally concealed
under his nail. <span class="smcap">Thimble-rigging</span> has of late years given way to
“broad-working.”</p>

<p><b>Thimble-twisters</b>, thieves who rob persons of their watches.</p>

<p><b>Thingumy</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">THINGUMBOB</span>, expressions used for the name of a thing
which cannot be recollected at the instant.</p>

<p><b>Thin-skinned</b>, over-nice, petulant, apt to get a “<a href="#Raw">raw</a>.” <i>See</i> that term.</p>

<p><b>Three-cornered scraper</b>, a cocked hat.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Three sheets in the wind</b>, unsteady from drink.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Three-up</b>, a gambling game played by costers and others of like grade.
Three halfpennies are thrown up by one man to the call of another.
If they do not come all alike, the cry is void, and the calling and tossing
are resumed. When the three coins are all alike they are said to
“come off,” and then all bets are decided according to the success or
failure of the caller. When two men toss, they play “up for up,” <i>i.e.</i>,
they toss and cry alternately. When three or more join in, the gathering
is named a school, and one man, who is called a pieman, cries to
the halfpence of the others until he loses, when the winner of the toss
becomes pieman in turn.</p>

<p><b>Through</b>, finished. In America, where this word is most used in the
sense now given, a guest who has had enough will, when asked to take
more, say, “I’m <span class="smcap lowercase">THROUGH</span>,” which is certainly preferable to the other
Americanism, “crammed.”</p>

<p><b>Thrummer</b>, a threepenny bit.</p>

<p><b>Thrums</b>, threepence. Also, in Coventry, remnants and waste pieces of
silk.</p>

<p><b>Thrups</b>, threepence. <i>See</i> the preceding, which is more general.</p>

<p><b>Thud</b>, the dull, dead sound made by the fall of a heavy body, or the
striking of a bullet against any soft, fleshy substance.</p>

<p><b>Thumper</b>, a magnificently constructed lie, a lie about which there is no
stint of imaginative power.</p>

<p><b>Thumping</b>, large, fine, or strong.</p>

<p><b>Thunderbomb</b>, an imaginary ship of vast size. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Merry_Dun_Of_Dover">Merry Dun of
Dover</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Thunderer</b>, the <i>Times</i> newspaper, sometimes termed “the <span class="smcap">Thunderer</span>
of Printing House Square,” from the locality where it is printed.</p>

<p><b>Thundering</b>, large, extra-sized.</p>

<p><b>Tibbing out</b>, going out of bounds.&mdash;<i>Charterhouse.</i></p>

<p><b>Tibby</b>, the head. Street slang, with no known etymology. To drop on
one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">TIBBY</span> is to frighten or startle any one, to take one unawares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tib’s eve</b>, “neither before Christmas nor after,” an indefinite period;
like the Greek Kalends, <span class="smcap">Tib’s eve</span> has a future application; an indefinite
period of past time is sometimes said to be “when Adam was an
oakum-boy in Chatham Dockyard.” “The reign of Queen Dick” is
another form of this kind of expression, and is used to indicate either
past time or future.</p>

<div>
<p><b><a id="Tick"></a>Tick</b>, credit, trust. Johnson says it is a corruption of “ticket,”&mdash;tradesmen’s
bills being formerly written on tickets or cards. On <span class="smcap lowercase">TICK</span>,
therefore, is equivalent to on <span class="smcap lowercase">TICKET</span>, or on trust. In use in 1668, and
before, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No matter upon landing whether you have money or no&mdash;you may swim in
twentie of their boats over the river upon <span class="smcap lowercase">TICKET</span>.”&mdash;<i>Decker’s Gulls’ Hornbook</i>,
1609.</p></div>
</div>


<p><b>Ticker</b>, a watch. Formerly cant, now street slang.</p>

<p><b>Ticket</b>, “that’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">TICKET</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, that’s what is wanted, or what is best.
Probable corruption of “that’s <i>etiquette</i>,” or, perhaps, from <span class="smcap lowercase">TICKET</span>, a
bill or invoice. This phrase is sometimes extended into “that’s the
<span class="smcap lowercase">TICKET</span> for soup,” in allusion to the card given to beggars for immediate
relief at soup kitchens. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Tick">TICK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Tickle</b>, to puzzle; “a reg’lar <span class="smcap lowercase">TICKLER</span>” is a poser.</p>

<p><b>Tiddlywink</b>, slim, puny; sometimes <span class="smcap lowercase">TILLYWINK</span>.</p>

<p><b>Tidy</b>, tolerably, or pretty well; “How did you get on to-day?”&mdash;“Oh,
<span class="smcap lowercase">TIDY</span>.”&mdash;<i>Saxon.</i></p>

<p><b>Tie</b>, a dead heat. A game of any kind, in which the possibility exists, is
said to end in a tie, if the markings are level on each side at the finish.
In racing parlance, all level finishes are called dead-heats.</p>

<p><b>Tied up</b>, given over, finished; also married, in allusion to the hymeneal
knot, unless a jocose allusion be intended to the “halter” (altar). <i>See</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Buckled">BUCKLED</a></span>, term in use among costermongers and street folk generally.</p>

<p><b>Tiff</b>, a pet, a fit of ill humour.</p>

<p><b>Tiffin</b>, a breakfast, <i>déjeûner à la fourchette</i>.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Indian Slang.</i></p>

<p><b>Tiffy</b>, easily offended, apt to be annoyed.</p>

<p><b>Tiger</b>, a parasite; also a term for a ferocious woman; a boy employed to
wait on gentlemen&mdash;one who waits on ladies is a page.</p>

<p><b>Tiger</b>, a superlative yell. “Three cheers, and the last in <span class="smcap lowercase">TIGERS</span>.”&mdash;<i>American.</i>
To “fight the <span class="smcap lowercase">TIGER</span>” is also American, and refers to
gambling with professionals&mdash;dangerous pastime.</p>

<p><b>Tight</b>, close, stingy; hard up, short of cash; <span class="smcap lowercase">TIGHT</span>, spruce, strong, active;
“a <span class="smcap lowercase">TIGHT</span> lad,” a smart, active young fellow; <span class="smcap lowercase">TIGHT</span>, drunk, or nearly
so, generally the result of “going on the loose;” “<span class="smcap lowercase">TIGHT</span>-laced,”
puritanical, over-precise. Money is said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">TIGHT</span> when the public,
from want of confidence in the aspect of affairs, are not inclined to
speculate.</p>

<p><b>Tightener</b>, a dinner, or hearty meal. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Spitalfields_breakfast">Spitalfields’ breakfast</a></span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’m a gent, I’m a gent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the Regent-Street style,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Examine my costume,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And look at my <span class="smcap lowercase">TILE</span>.”&mdash;<i>Popular Song.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes used in another sense, “having a <span class="smcap lowercase">TILE</span> loose,” <i>i.e.</i>, being
slightly crazy. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Pantile">PANTILE</a></span>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Timber merchant</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">SPUNK FENCER</span>, a lucifer-match seller.</p>

<p><b>Timber-toes</b>, a wooden-legged man. Also at the East-end one who
wears clogs, <i>i.e.</i>, wooden soled boots.</p>

<p><b>Time</b>, cabman’s slang for money. If they wish to express 9s. 9d. they
say that “it is a quarter to ten;” if 3s. 6d., half-past three; if 11s. 9d.
a quarter to twelve. Cab-drivers can hardly have originated a system
which has been in existence as long as the adage, “Time is money.”
They have, however, the full use of the arrangement, which is perhaps
the simplest on record.</p>

<p><b>Time</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TO DO</span>, to work out a sentence of imprisonment. Time is the
generic term for all quantities of incarceration, whether short or long.
Sometimes stir-time (imprisonment in the House of Correction) is distinguished
from the more extended system of punishment which is
called “pinnel (penal) time.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Time_o_day"></a>Time o’ day</b>, a dodge, the latest aspect of affairs; “that’s your <span class="smcap lowercase">TIME
O’ DAY</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, that’s well done; to put a person up to the <span class="smcap lowercase">TIME O’ DAY</span>,
or let him know “what’s o’clock,” is to instruct him in the knowledge
needful for him.</p>

<p><b>Tin</b>, money,&mdash;generally applied to silver.</p>

<p><b>Tinge</b>, the per-centage allowed by drapers and clothiers to their assistants
upon the sale of old-fashioned articles. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Spiffs">SPIFFS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Tinkler</b>, a bell. “Jerk the <span class="smcap lowercase">TINKLER</span>,” ring the bell. Refined or
affected slangists sometimes say, “Agitate the communicator,” which,
though it represents “ring the bell,” should more properly mean “pull
the cord.”</p>

<p><b>Tin-pot</b>, “he plays a <span class="smcap lowercase">TIN-POT</span> game,” <i>i.e.</i>, a low, mean, or shabby game.
In the <i>Contes d’Eutrapel</i>, a French officer at the siege of Chatillon is
ridiculously spoken of as Captain <span class="smcap">Tin-pot</span>&mdash;<i>Capitaine du Pot d’Etain</i>.
<span class="smcap">Tin-pot</span>, as generally used, means worthless. As applied to billiards
and kindred games, it means pretentious and inferior play.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>, advice or information respecting anything, but mostly used in
reference to horse-racing, so that the person <span class="smcap lowercase">TIPPED</span> may know how to
bet to the best advantage. The “straight <span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span>” is the <span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span> which
comes direct from the owner or trainer of a horse. Of late years a
“straight <span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span>” means a direct hint on any subject.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>, a douceur; “that’s the <span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, that’s the proper thing to do.
“To miss one’s <span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span>,” to fail in a scheme.&mdash;<i>Old Cant.</i></p>

<p><b>Tip</b>, to give, lend, or hand over anything to another person; “come, <span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span>
up the tin,” <i>i.e.</i>, hand up the money; “<span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span> the wink,” to inform by
winking; “<span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span> us your fin,” <i>i.e.</i>, give me your hand; “<span class="smcap lowercase">TIP</span> one’s
boom off,” to make off, or depart. From the seafaring phrase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tip the double</b>, to “bolt,” or run away from any one.</p>

<p><b>Tip-top</b>, first-rate, of the best kind.</p>

<p><b>Tip-topper</b>, a “swell,” or dressy man, a “Gorger.”</p>

<p><b>Tipper</b>, a kind of ale brewed at Brighton. Mrs. Gamp preferred the

<div>
<p><b>Tipster</b>, a “turf” agent who collects early and generally special information
of the condition and racing capabilities of horses in the training
districts, and posts the same to his subscribers to guide their betting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The racing <span class="smcap lowercase">TIPSTERS</span> have much less patronage than formerly, before
“Geoffry Greenhorn” laid a trap for them, and published the tips he received
in <i>The Life</i>. Professor Ingledue, M.A., the mesmerist, is silent; and if their
subscribers, ‘for whose interests I have collected my old and able staff, with
many additional ones, who are already at work in the training districts,’ could
only get a sight of the ‘old and able staff,’ they would find it consisting of a
man and a boy, at work in the back room of a London public-house, and sending
different winners for every race to their subscribers.”&mdash;<i>Post and Paddock</i>,
by the “Druid.”</p></div>

<p>There are, however, whatever non-racing men may think, many “touts”
whose information is valuable to even the “best informed” writers.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><b>Tit</b>, a favourite name for a horse.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They scorned the coach, they scorned the rails,<br /></span>

<p><b><a id="Toby"></a>Toby</b>, the road. The highwayman or swell robber was in old days said

meaner fellows, the footpad and the cutpurse, were but “low <span class="smcap lowercase">TOBY-MEN</span>,”
from their frequenting the by-ways.</p>

<p><b>To-do</b> (pronounced quickly, and as one word), a disturbance, trouble;
“here’s a pretty <span class="smcap lowercase">TO-DO</span>,” here is an unpleasant difficulty. This exactly
tallies with the <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">AFFAIRE</span> (<i>à faire</i>).&mdash;<i>See</i> <i>Forby’s Vocabulary of
East Anglia</i>.</p>

<p><b>To the nines</b>, to the dodges of the day. “He’s up to the <span class="smcap lowercase">NINES</span>,”
means he’s up to everything. “Dressed to the <span class="smcap lowercase">NINES</span>,” means dressed
loudly, or, as it is more generally known now, “dressed to death.”</p>

<p><b>Toe</b>, to kick. “I’ll <span class="smcap lowercase">TOE</span> your backside.” Common in London.</p>

<p>This is but a variation of the Scottish <span class="smcap">Tolbooth</span>.</p>

<p><b>Tom</b>, <i>e.g.</i>, “after <span class="smcap">Tom</span>,” after the hour at which Big <span class="smcap">Tom</span> of Christchurch

<p><b>Tomfoolery</b>, nonsense; trashy, mild, and innocuous literature.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Tom-fool’s colours</b>, scarlet and yellow, the ancient motley. Occasionally,

Both term and practice, general among English operatives for half-a-century,

<p><b>Top-sawyer</b>, the principal of a party, or profession. “A <span class="smcap lowercase">TOP-SAWYER</span>
signifies a man that is a master-genius in any profession. It is a piece
of Norfolk slang, and took its rise from Norfolk being a great timber
county, where the <span class="smcap lowercase">TOP SAWYERS</span> get double the wages of those beneath
them.”&mdash;<i>Randall’s Diary</i>, 1820.</p>

they mix and chop up for home consumption or sale.</p>

<p><b>Topsy-turvy</b>, the bottom upwards. Grose gives an ingenious etymology
of this once cant term, viz., “top-side turf-ways,”&mdash;turf being always
laid the wrong side upwards. This is so far ingenious that it creates a
fact for the purpose of arguing from it. Turfs are laid with the grass
part together during carriage; so, anyhow, the definition could be only
half right. In fact, <span class="smcap lowercase">TOPSY-TURVY</span> is but short for “top-side t’other way.”</p>

<p><b>To-rights</b>, excellent, very well, or good.&mdash;<i>Low London slang.</i></p>

“<span class="smcap">Tot</span>” is a bone, but chiffoniers and cinder-hunters generally are
called <span class="smcap lowercase">TOT-PICKERS</span> nowadays. <span class="smcap">Totting</span> also has its votaries on the
banks of the Thames, where all kinds of flotsam and jetsam, from
coals to carrion, are known as <span class="smcap lowercase">TOTS</span>.</p>

extent to which a person is interested or affected, “as a fourpenny
<span class="smcap lowercase">TOUCH</span>,” <i>i.e.</i>, a thing costing fourpence. <i>See</i> an example in Mr., afterwards
Sir Erasmus, Philipps’s Diary, at Oxford, in 1720. “<i>Sept. 22.</i>&mdash;At

to drive against things so closely as absolutely to touch, yet without
injury. This they called a <span class="smcap lowercase">TOUCHER</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">TOUCH-AND-GO</span>, which was
hence applied to anything which was within an ace of ruin.</p>

<p><b><a id="Touchy"></a>Touchy</b>, peevish, irritable. Johnson terms it a low word.</p>

<p><b>Tout.</b> In sporting phraseology a <span class="smcap lowercase">TOUT</span> signifies an agent in the training
districts, on the look-out for information as to the condition and capabilities
of those horses entering for a coming race. <span class="smcap">Touts</span> often get

<p><b><a id="Tree"></a>Tree</b>, “up a <span class="smcap lowercase">TREE</span>,” in temporary difficulties,&mdash;out of the way. American
expression, derived from racoon or bear-hunting. When Bruin is
<span class="smcap lowercase">TREED</span>, or is forced up a <span class="smcap lowercase">TREE</span> by the dogs, it means that then the tug
of war begins. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Coon">’COON</a></span>. Hence when an opponent is fairly run to

except the mutton, placed on the table previous to the removal of the
cloth. A boiled leg o’ mutton and <span class="smcap lowercase">TRIMMINGS</span> will be always known
as a “swarry” to admirers of Sam Weller.</p>

him up nicely, didn’t we?” <i>i.e.</i>, we made him (the private buyer) pay

<p><b>Walker</b>, a letter-carrier or postman. From an old song, called, “Walker,
the twopenny postman.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Walker"></a>Walker!</b> or <span class="smcap">Hookey Walker!</span> an ejaculation of incredulity, used when
a person is telling a story which you know to be all gammon, or worse.
One explanation of the phrase is this:&mdash;“Years ago there was a person
named Walker, an aquiline-nosed Jew, who exhibited an orrery,
which he called by the erudite name of ‘Eidouranion.’ He was also
a popular lecturer on astronomy, and often, telescope in hand, invited
his pupils to ‘take a sight’ at the moon and stars. The lecturer’s phrase
struck his schoolboy auditory, who frequently ‘took a sight’ with that
gesture of outstretched arm and adjustment to nose and eye which was
the first garnish of the popular saying. The next step was to assume
phrase and gesture as the outward and visible mode of knowingness in
general.” This has been denied, however, and a statement made that
<span class="smcap">Hookey Walker</span> was a magistrate of dreaded acuteness and incredulity,
whose hooked nose gave the title of “beak” to all his successors;
it is also said, moreover, that the gesture of applying the thumb to the
nose and agitating the little finger, as an expression of “Don’t you
wish you may get it?” is considerably older than the first story would
seem to indicate. There are many and various explanations of the
term, given according to the development of fancy.&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries</i>,
iv. 425.</p>

<p><b>Walking the pegs</b>, a method of cheating at the game of cribbage, by
a species of legerdemain, the sharper either moving his own pegs

either from choice or through not being able to obtain a partner.

<p><b>Wallabee-track</b>, Colonial slang for the tramp. When a man in Australia
is “on the road” looking for employment, he is said to be on
the <span class="smcap lowercase">WALLABEE-TRACK</span>.</p>

<p><b>Wallop</b>, to beat, or thrash. John Gough Nichols derives this word from
an ancestor of the Earl of Portsmouth, one Sir John Wallop, Knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of the Garter, who in King Henry VIII.’s time distinguished himself
by <span class="smcap lowercase">WALLOPING</span> the French; but it is more probably connected with
wheal, a livid swelling in the skin after a blow. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Pot-walloper">POT-WALLOPER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Walloping</b>, a beating or thrashing; sometimes used in an adjective

by stewards regularly appointed by “the chapel.”</p>

<p><b>Weather eye</b>, the cautious eye. Any one who is supposed to have an
extra good knowledge of things in general, or to be hard to impose
on or cheat, is said to have his <span class="smcap lowercase">WEATHER EYE</span> well open.</p>

<p><b>Weather-headed</b>, so written by Sir Walter Scott in his <i>Peveril of the
Peak</i>, but it is more probably <span class="smcap lowercase">WETHER-HEADED</span>, as applied to a person
having a “sheepish” look.</p>

<p><b>Weaving</b>, a notorious card-sharping trick, done by keeping certain cards
on the knee, or between the knee and the under side of the table, and
using them when required by changing them for the cards held in the
hand.</p>

<p><b>Weaving leather aprons.</b> When a knowing blade is asked what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
he has been doing lately, and does not choose to tell, his reply is, that
he has been very busy <span class="smcap lowercase">WEAVING LEATHER APRONS</span>. (From the
reports of a celebrated trial for gold robbery on the South-Western
Railway.) Other similar replies are, “I have been making a trundle

<p><b>Weight-for-age</b>, a sporting phrase which, applied to a race, distinguishes
it from a handicap or catch-weight event, and informs all
interested that the animals which run carry according to their ages, and
not their abilities. Winners of certain great races generally carry
penalties in addition to <span class="smcap lowercase">WEIGHT-FOR-AGE</span>, for the purpose of equalizing
matters somewhat; but as a rule the results are fairly foreshadowed
as soon as in these races the horses are at the post, or as soon as the
starters are positively known.</p>

<p><b>Wejee</b>, a chimney-pot. Often applied to any clever invention, as, “That’s
a regular <span class="smcap lowercase">WEJEE</span>.”</p>

<div>
<p><b>Welcher</b>, a person who makes a bet without the remotest chance of
being able to pay, and, losing it, absconds, or “makes himself scarce.”
In the betting ring a <span class="smcap lowercase">WELCHER</span> is often very severely handled upon his
swindling practices being discovered. The Catterick “Clerk of the
Course” once provided some stout labourers and a tar-barrel for the
special benefit of the <span class="smcap lowercase">WELCHERS</span> who might visit that neighbourhood.
The word is modern, but the practice is ancient.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One Moore, the unworthy incumbent of the ‘Suffolk curacy,’ dedicated a book
to ‘Duke Humphrey,’ and was then entirely lost sight of by his old college
friends, till one of them espied him slung up in ‘the basket,’ for not paying his
bets at a cock-pit.”&mdash;<i>Post and Paddock.</i></p></div>

<p>One writer says the term “arose from a fellow who took deposits on
account of Welsh ponies, which he said he was importing, and never
delivered them.” It is not unfrequently suggested by irreverent persons
that the word was suggested by the dislike his gracious Majesty George
the Fourth had, when a young man, for settling. Others derive it from
the nursery rhyme,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There can be no doubt that, from the days when the stout Earl of
Chester and others were constantly employed in checking and cutting
off the expeditions of their neighbours till comparatively recently, the
term “Welshman” has been hardly one of kindness. It is not hard,
therefore, to imagine its use on the Roodee, and its subsequent corruption
into <span class="smcap lowercase">WELCHER</span>. The spelling of the word, <span class="smcap lowercase">WELCHER</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">WELSHER</span>,
is optional.</p>
</div>

habits is said to “<span class="smcap lowercase">WELL</span> it.”</p>

<p><b>Welt</b>, to thrash with a strap or stick. Probably meaning to raise wheals.</p>

<p><b>West central</b>, a water-closet, the initials being the same as those of the
London Postal District. It is said that for this reason very delicate
people refuse to obey Rowland Hill’s instructions in this particular.
An old maid, who lived in this district, was particularly shocked at
having <span class="smcap lowercase">W.C.</span> marked on all her letters, and informed the letter-carrier
that she could not think of submitting to such an indecent fashion.
On being informed that the letters would not be forwarded without
the obnoxious initials, she remarked that she would have them left at
the Post-Office. “Then, marm,” said the fellow, with a grin, “they
will put <span class="smcap lowercase">P.O.</span> on them, which will be more ondacenter than the
tother.”</p>

<p><b>Wet</b>, a drink, a drain.</p>

<p><b>Wet</b>, to drink. Low people generally ask an acquaintance to <span class="smcap lowercase">WET</span> any
recently purchased article, <i>i.e.</i>, to stand treat on the occasion. “<span class="smcap">Wet</span>
(originally <span class="smcap lowercase">WHET</span>, to sharpen,) your whistle,” <i>i.e.</i>, take a drink; “<span class="smcap lowercase">WET</span>
the other eye,” <i>i.e.</i>, take another glass. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Shed_a_tear">SHED A TEAR</a></span>.</p>

dialogue.</p>

of a similar kind to that described.</p>

taken.</p>

<p><b>Whip</b>, the member of the House of Commons whose duty it is to collect

<p><b><a id="Wipe-out"></a>Wipe-out</b>, to kill or utterly destroy. This is an Americanism, but is
in pretty general use here.</p>

<p><b>Wire-in</b>, a London street phrase in general use, which means to go in

<p><b>Wooden wedge</b>, the last name in the classical
honours’ list at Cambridge. The last
in mathematical honours had long been
known as the <span class="smcap lowercase">WOODEN SPOON</span>; but when
the classical Tripos was instituted in 1824,
it was debated among the undergraduates
what sobriquet should be given to the last
on the examination list. Curiously enough,
the name that year which happened to be
last was <span class="smcap">Wedgewood</span> (a distinguished Wrangler). Hence the title.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Wool</b>, courage, pluck; “you are not half-<span class="smcap lowercase">WOOLED</span>,” term of reproach
from one thief to another.</p>

<p><b>Wool</b>, bravery, pluck. Term much in use among pugilists and their admirers.
The highest praise that can be bestowed on a man of courage
in lower-class circles is that which characterizes him as being “a reg’lar
wooled un,” or “a rare <span class="smcap lowercase">WOOL-TOPPED UN</span>.” Derived from the
great pluck and perseverance shown by many pugilists of whole or
partial colour, from Molyneux down to Bob Travers.</p>

<p><b>Woolbird</b>, a lamb; “wing of a <span class="smcap lowercase">WOOLBIRD</span>,” a shoulder of lamb.</p>

<p><b>Wool-gathering</b>, said of any person’s wits when they are wandering,
or in a reverie.</p>

<p><b><a id="Work"></a>Work</b>, to plan, or lay down and execute any course of action, to perform
anything; “to <span class="smcap lowercase">WORK</span> the bulls,” <i>i.e.</i>, to get rid of false crown pieces;
“to work the oracle,” to succeed by manœuvring, to concert a wily
plan, to victimize,&mdash;a possible reference to the stratagems and bribes
used to corrupt the Delphic oracle, and cause it to deliver a favourable
response. “To <span class="smcap lowercase">WORK</span> a street or neighbourhood,” to try at each
house to sell all one can, or to bawl so that every housewife may know
what is to be sold. The general plan is to drive a donkey-barrow
a short distance, and then stop and cry. The term implies thoroughness;
to “<span class="smcap lowercase">WORK</span> a street well” is a common saying with a coster.
“To <span class="smcap lowercase">WORK</span> a benefit” is to canvass among one’s friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p><b>Worm.</b> <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Pump">PUMP</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Worm</b>, a policeman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Worming</b>, removing the beard of an oyster or mussel.</p>

<p><b><a id="W_P"></a>W. P.</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">WARMING-PAN</span>. A clergyman who holds a living <i>pro tempore</i>,
under a bond of resignation, is styled a <span class="smcap lowercase">W. P.</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">WARMING-PAN</span> rector,
because he keeps the place warm for his successor. <span class="smcap">Warming-pan</span>
was a term first popularly applied to a substitute in the reign of
James II.</p>

<p><b>Wrinkle</b>, an idea, or a fancy; an additional piece of knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Write</b>, as “to <span class="smcap lowercase">WRITE</span> one’s name on a joint,” to leave the impression of
one’s handiwork thereon, to have the first cut at anything; to leave
visible traces of one’s presence anywhere.</p>

<p><b>Wylo</b>, be off.&mdash;<i>Anglo-Chinese.</i></p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>X.</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">LETTER X</span>, a method of arrest used by policemen with desperate
ruffians,&mdash;by getting a firm grasp on the collar, and drawing the captive’s
hand over the holding arm, and pressing the fingers down in a
peculiar way&mdash;the captured person’s arm in this way can be more
easily broken than extricated.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>Yack</b>, a watch; to “church a <span class="smcap lowercase">YACK</span>,” to take it out of its case to avoid
detection, otherwise to “christen a <span class="smcap lowercase">YACK</span>.”</p>

<p><b>Yaffle</b>, to eat.&mdash;<i>Old English.</i></p>

<p><b>Yahoo</b>, a person of coarse or degraded habits. Derived from the use of
the word by Swift.</p>

<p><b>Yam</b>, to eat. This word is used by the lowest class all over the world;
by the Wapping sailor, West Indian negro, or Chinese coolie. When
the fort, called the Dutch Folly, near Canton, was in course of erection
by the Hollanders, under the pretence of being intended for an
hospital, the Chinese observed a box containing muskets among the
alleged hospital stores. “Hy-aw!” exclaimed John Chinaman, “How
can sick man <span class="smcap lowercase">YAM</span> gun?” The Dutch were surprised and massacred
the same night.</p>

<p><b>Yappy</b>, soft, foolish; mostly applied to an over-generous person, from the
fact that it originally meant one who paid for everything. <span class="smcap">Yap</span> is
back slang for pay, and often when a man is asked to pay more than he
considers correct, he says, “Do you think I’m <span class="smcap lowercase">YAPPY</span>?” do you think
I’m paying mad? Thus slang begets slang.</p>

<p><b>Yard of clay</b>, a long, old-fashioned tobacco pipe; also called a
churchwarden.</p>

<p><b>Yarmouth capon</b>, a bloater, or red herring.</p>

<p><b>Yarmouth mittens</b>, bruised hands.&mdash;<i>Sea.</i></p>

<p><b>Yay-nay</b>, “a poor <span class="smcap lowercase">YAY-NAY</span>” fellow, one who has no conversational
power, and can only answer <span class="smcap lowercase">YEA</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">NAY</span> to a question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Yellow-Jack</b>, the yellow fever prevalent in the West Indies.</p>

<p><b>Yellow-man</b>, a yellow silk handkerchief.</p>

<p><b>Yellows</b>, a term of reproach applied to Bluecoat and other charity school
boys.</p>

<p><b>Yid</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">YIT</span>, a Jew. <span class="smcap">Yidden</span>, the Jewish people. The Jews use these
terms very frequently.</p>

<p><b>Yokel</b>, a countryman. Probably from yoke, representative of his occupation.
Some fancy, however, that the word was originally <span class="smcap lowercase">YOWKEL</span>,
in imitation of the broad tones of country labourers.</p>

<p><b>Yokuff</b>, a chest, or large box.</p>

<p><b>Yorkshire</b>, “to <span class="smcap">Yorkshire</span>,” or “come <span class="smcap">Yorkshire</span> over any person,”
to cheat or cozen him. The proverbial over-reaching of the rustics
of this county has given rise to the phrase, which is sometimes pronounced
Yorshar. To put Yorshar to a man, is to trick or deceive
him. This latter is from a work in the Lancashire dialect, 1757.</p>

<p><b>Yorkshire compliment</b>, a gift of something useless to the giver.
Sometimes called a North-country compliment.</p>

<p><b>Yorkshire estates;</b> “I will do it when I come into my <span class="smcap">Yorkshire
estates</span>,”&mdash;meaning if I ever have the money or the means.</p>

<p><b>Yorkshire reckoning</b>, a reckoning in which every one pays his own
share.</p>

<p><b>Younker</b>, in street language, a lad or a boy. Term in general use
amongst costermongers, cabmen, and old-fashioned people. Barnefield’s
<i>Affectionate Shepherd</i>, 1594, has the phrase, “a seemelie
<span class="smcap lowercase">YOUNKER</span>.” <i>Danish</i> and <i>Friesic</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">JONKER</span>. In the navy, a naval
cadet is usually termed a <span class="smcap lowercase">YOUNKER</span>.</p>

<p><b>Your nibs</b>, yourself. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Nibs">NIBS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Yoxter</b>, a convict returned from transportation before his time.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

<p><b>Ziff</b>, a juvenile thief.</p>

<p><b><a id="Ziph"></a>Ziph</b>, <span class="smcap lowercase">LANGUAGE OF</span>, a way of disguising English in use among the students
at Winchester College. Compare <span class="smcap"><a href="#Medical_Greek">medical Greek</a></span>. De Quincey, in
his <i>Autobiographic Sketches</i>, says that he acquired this language as a
boy, from a Dr. Mapleton, who had three sons at Winchester who
had imported it from thence as their sole accomplishment, and that
after the lapse of fifty years he could, and did with Lord Westport, converse
in it with ease and rapidity. It was communicated at Winchester
to new-comers for a fixed fee of half a guinea. The secret is this,&mdash;repeat
the vowel or diphthong of every syllable, prefixing to the vowel
so repeated the letter G, and placing the accent on the intercalated
syllable. Thus, for example, “Shall we go away in an hour?”
“Shagall wege gogo agawagay igin agan hougour?” “Three hours we
have already stayed,” “Threegee hougours wege hagave agalreageadygy
stagayed.” De Quincey could hardly have been considered complimentary
to his own memory if he supposed that he, or for the matter of that
any one possessed of brains, could forget anything so simple; or that,
if forgotten until suddenly recalled, it could not be mastered by any
sensible person in a minute. The language of <span class="smcap lowercase">ZIPH</span> is far inferior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
any of the slangs manufactured by the lower classes. Evidently any
consonant will answer the purpose; F or L would be softer, and so far
better. This <span class="smcap lowercase">ZIPH</span> system is not confined to Winchester College, as it
is recorded and described amongst many other modes of cryptical communication,
oral and visual, spoken, written, and symbolic, in an <i>Essay
towards a Real Character and a Philosophic Language</i> (founded on or
suggested by a treatise published just before, by Geo. Dalgarne), by
John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, published by order of the Royal
Society, fol. 1668, and as the bishop does not speak of it as a recent
invention, it may probably at that time have been regarded as an
antique device for conducting a conversation in secrecy amongst
bystanders&mdash;which says very little for either the designers or the
bystanders.</p>

<h2>SOME ACCOUNT
OF
THE BACK SLANG.</h2>


<p>The costermongers of London number between thirty
and forty thousand. Like other low tribes, they boast a
language, or secret tongue, by which they hide their designs,
movements, and other private affairs. This costers’ speech
offers no new fact, or approach to a fact, for philologists; it is
not very remarkable for originality of construction, neither is it
spiced with low humour, as other cant. But the costermongers
boast that it is known only to themselves; that it is far beyond
the Irish, and puzzles the Jews. This is, however, but a poor
fiction; for, as will be seen, the slang current among them is
of the crudest conception, and only difficult to the most ignorant.
Any one of the smallest pretensions to ability could
learn back slang&mdash;could, in fact, create it for himself&mdash;as far as
the costers’ vocabulary extends, in a couple of hours. Since
the early editions of this work were published back slang has
become very common; and is now mostly spoken, mixed however,
with various other kinds of slang, in the public markets&mdash;the
new dead-meat market being, perhaps, strongest in the way
of pure&mdash;if the term may be used&mdash;back slang.</p>

<p>The main principle of this language is spelling the words backwards&mdash;or
rather, pronouncing them rudely backwards. Sometimes,
for the sake of harmony, an extra syllable is prefixed or
annexed; and occasionally the word receives quite a different
turn, in rendering it backwards, from what an uninitiated person
would have expected. One coster told Mayhew that he often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
gave the end of a word “a new turn, just as if he chorused it
with a tol-de-rol.” But then costermongers, and more especially
those who confided their joys and sorrows to the gentleman just
named, are not to be relied on. The coster has, of course, his
own idea of the proper way of spelling words, and is not to be
convinced but by an overwhelming show of learning,&mdash;and
frequently not then, for he is a very headstrong fellow. By the
time a coster has spelt an ordinary word of two or three
syllables in the proper way, and then spelt it backwards, it has
become a tangled knot that no etymologist could unravel. The
word “generalize,” for instance, is considered to be “shilling”
spelt backwards, while “genitraf” is supposed to represent farthing.
Sometimes slang and cant words are introduced, and
even these, when imagined to be tolerably well known, are pronounced
backwards. Very often, instead of a word being spelt
backwards right through, the syllables retain their original
order; the initial <i>h</i> is pronounced as though <i>c</i> were before
it, “tatch” being back slang for hat, and “flatch” the word
supposed to represent half. Again, the full words are shortened,
as “gen” for “generalize,” a shilling; and various other
artifices are resorted to, in the hope of adding to the natural
difficulties of back slang.</p>

<p>This back language, back slang, or “kacab genals,” as it
is called by the costermongers themselves, is supposed to be
regarded by the rising generation of street-sellers as a distinct
and regular mode of intercommunication. People who hear this
slang for the first time never refer words, by inverting them, to
their originals; and the “yanneps,” “esclops,” and “nammows,”
are looked upon as secret terms. Those who practise
the slang soon obtain a considerable stock vocabulary, so that
they converse rather from the memory than the understanding.
Amongst the senior costermongers, and those who pride themselves
on their proficiency in back slang, a conversation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
often sustained for a whole evening&mdash;that is, the chief words
are in the back slang&mdash;especially if any “flats” are present
whom they wish to astonish or confuse.</p>

<p>The addition of an <i>s</i> invariably forms the plural, so that this
is another source of complication. For instance, woman in the
back slang is “nammow,” and “nammows” is “women.”
The explorer, then, in undoing the back slang, and turning
the word once more into English, would have a novel and very
extraordinary rendering of women. Where a word is refractory
in submitting to a back rendering, as in the case of “pound,”
letters are made to change positions for the sake of harmony;
thus we have “dunop,” a pound, instead of “dnuop,” which
nobody could pleasantly pronounce. Also all words of one
syllable which end with two consonants&mdash;such, for instance, as cold,
drunk&mdash;become dissyllables when read backwards, the vowel
e being imagined between the then first and second consonants,
as “deloc,” “kennurd.” Others take the vowel as an initial,
girl being pronounced “elrig.” This arrangement, as a modification
to suit circumstances, may remind the reader of the
Jews’ “Old clo’! old clo’!” instead of “Old clothes! old
clothes!” which it is supposed would tire the patience of even
a Jew to repeat all day.</p>

<p>The back slang has been in vogue for many years. It is,
as before stated, very easily acquired, and is principally used by
the costermongers and others who practise it (as the specimen
Glossary will show) for communicating the secrets of their
street tradings, the cost of and profit on goods, and for keeping
their natural enemies, the police, in the dark. “Cool the
esclop” (look at the police) is often said among them, when
one of the constabulary makes his appearance. It is only fair
to assume, however, that the police know as much or more
about the back slang than do the costers; and every child in
a “shy” neighbourhood knows the meaning of the phrase just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
quoted. Those who regard the London costermonger as a
fearful being are very much mistaken,&mdash;he is singularly simple-minded
and innocent, and has, indeed, very little to conceal;
but he certainly does like to wrap himself up as in a garment of
mystery, and sometimes believes that the few words of slang he
knows, mixed as they are, and troublesome as they have been
to him, form an impenetrable barrier between him and the rest
of the world. He is fond of exhibiting what knowledge he
possesses, and so talks slang in public much more than in
private; but at most the slang words used bear not forty per
cent. proportion to the rest of his conversational structure,
even when he exerts himself to the uttermost limits of his
ability and education, and even when he is a leader in his walk
of life.</p>

<p>Perhaps on no subject is the costermonger so silent as on
his money affairs. All costs and profits, he thinks, should be
kept profoundly secret. The back slang, therefore, gives the
various small amounts very minutely, but, as has been before
remarked, these words are known wherever common folk most
do congregate, and are peculiar only for their variations from
the original in the way of pronunciation:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<b>Flatch</b>, halfpenny.<br />
<b>Yannep</b>, penny.<br />
<b>Owt-yanneps</b>, twopence.<br />
<b>Erth-yanneps</b>, threepence.<br />
<b>Roaf-yanneps</b>, fourpence.<br />
<b>Evif, or ewif-yanneps</b>, fivepence.<br />
<b>Exis-yanneps</b>, sixpence.<br />
<b>Nevis-yanneps</b>, sevenpence.<br />
<b>Teaich, or theg-yanneps</b>, eightpence.<br />
<b>Enin-yanneps</b>, ninepence.<br />
<b>Net-yanneps</b>, tenpence.<br />
<b>Nevelé-yanneps</b>, elevenpence.<br />
<b>Evlénet-yanneps</b>, twelvepence.<br />
<b>Generalize</b>, one shilling.<br />
<b>Yannep-flatch</b>, three-halfpence.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span><b>Owt-yannep-flatch</b>, twopence-halfpenny. The word “flatch” represents the odd halfpenny when added to any number of “yanneps.”<br />
<b>Gen, or eno-gen</b>, one shilling. “Gen” is a contraction of “generalize.”<br />
<b>Owt-gens</b>, two shillings.<br />
<b>Erth-gens</b>, three shillings.<br />
</p>

<p>The “gens” continue in the same sequence as the “yanneps”
above; but, as a rule, the <i>s</i> is left out, and “owt” or “erth
gen” represents the quantity. This is, however, matter of
individual taste; and any reader who is anxious to become proficient
need not be afraid of committing a solecism&mdash;that’s a
good word for back slanging&mdash;by giving vent to any peculiarity
that may strike him. Variety is the charm of nature,
we are told; and in this particular, if in no other, back slang
and nature approach each other. So do extremes meet.</p>

<p><b>Yenork</b>, a crown piece, or five shillings.<br />
<b>Flatch-yenork</b>, half-a-crown. This is generally slurred into “flatch-a-nock.”
The crown in full rarely receives the title “yenork”
nowadays,&mdash;it is usually a “wheel” or “evif gen.”<br />
<b>Flatch a dunop</b>, ten shillings, <i>i.e.</i>, half a pound.</p>

<p>Beyond this amount the slangist reckons after an intricate
and complicated mode. Fifteen shillings would be “erth-evif-gen,”
or, literally, three times 5<i>s.</i>; seventeen and sixpence
would be “erth-yenork-flatch,” or three crowns and a half; or,
by another mode of reckoning, “erth-evif-gen flatch-yenork,”
<i>i.e.</i>, three times 5<i>s.</i>, and half-a-crown.</p>

<p><b>Dunop</b>, a pound. Varied by “Dick,” back slang for “quid.”</p>

<p>Further than which the costermonger seldom goes in money
reckoning.</p>

<p>In the following Glossary only those words are given which
are continually used,&mdash;the terms connected with street traffic,
the names of the different coins, vegetables, fruit, and fish,
technicalities of police courts, &amp;c. The reader might naturally
think that a system of speech so simple as the back slang
would require no Glossary; but he will quickly perceive, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the specimens given, that a great many words in frequent use
in a “back” sense, have become so twisted as to require a
little glossarial explanation.</p>

<div><p>This kind of slang, formed by reversing and transposing the
letters of a word, is not peculiar to the London costermongers.
Instances of an exactly similar secret dialect are found in the
Spanish “Germania” and French “Argot.” Thus:&mdash;</p>

<h2>GLOSSARY OF THE BACK SLANG.</h2>

<p><b>Birk</b>, a “crib,”&mdash;a house.</p>

<p><b>Cool</b>, to look.</p>

<p><b>Cool him</b>, look at him. A phrase frequently used when one costermonger
warns another of the approach of a policeman, or when any
person worthy of notice passes by. When any old lady has been
bargaining with a costermonger, and leaves his barrow without
purchasing, the proprietor of the barrow will call out to the rest, “<span class="smcap lowercase">COOL</span>
the delo nammow,” which, though it means literally nothing beyond
“Look at the old woman,” conveys to them an intimation that she is,
from their point of view, a nuisance, and should be treated as such.</p>

<p><b>Dab</b>, bad.</p>

<p><b>Dab tros</b>, a bad sort.</p>

<p><b>Dabheno</b>, a bad one, sometimes a bad market. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Doogheno">DOOGHENO</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>Da-erb</b>, bread.</p>

<p><b>Deb</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">DAB</span>, a bed; “I’m off to the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEB</span>,” I’m going to bed.</p>

<p><b>Delo nammow</b>, an old woman.</p>

<p><b>Delog</b>, gold.</p>

<p><b>Doog</b>, good.</p>

<p><b><a id="Doogheno"></a>Doogheno</b>, literally “good-one,” but implying generally a good market,
a good man, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Doogheno hit</b>, one good hit. A coster remarks to a mate, “Jack
made a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOOGHENO HIT</span> this morning,” implying that he did well at
market, or sold out with good profit. Actually a good hit only is intended,
but redundancy has its charms in the back slang as well as in
more pretentious literary efforts.</p>

<p><b>Dunop</b>, a pound.</p>

<p><b>Edgabac</b>, cabbage.</p>

<p><b>Edgenaro</b>, an orange.</p>

<p><b>E-fink</b>, a knife.</p>

<p><b>Erth gen</b>, three shillings.</p>

<p><b>Erth-pu</b>, three-up, a street game, played with three halfpence.</p>

<p><b>Erth sith-noms</b>, three months,&mdash;a term of imprisonment unfortunately
very familiar to the lower orders. Generally known as a “drag.”</p>

<p><b>Erth yanneps</b>, threepence.</p>

<p><b><a id="Esclop"></a>Esclop</b>, police, now used to signify a constable only. <span class="smcap">Esclop</span> is pronounced
“slop” simply, but the <i>c</i> was never sounded. A policeman is
now and then called, by some purist or stickler for etiquette, an
“esclopnam.”</p>

<p><b>Es-roch</b>, a horse.</p>

<p><b>Esuch</b>, a house.</p>

<p><b>Evif-gen</b>, a crown, or five shillings.</p>

<p><b>Evif-yanneps</b>, fivepence.</p>

reckoned in this manner, either with <span class="smcap lowercase">YANNEPS</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">GENS</span>. It is, however,
rarely or never done.</p>

<p><b>Exis-evif-yanneps</b>, elevenpence,&mdash;literally, “sixpence and fivepence
= elevenpence.” This mode of reckoning, distinct from the preceding,
is only made by special arrangement amongst slangites, who wish
to confound their intimates.</p>

<p><b>Exis gen</b>, six shillings.</p>

<p><b>Exis sith-noms</b>, six months.</p>

<p><b>Exis yanneps</b>, sixpence.</p>

<p><b>Flatch kennurd</b>, half drunk.</p>

<p><b>Flatch-yenork</b>, half-a-crown. <i>See</i> preceding remarks.</p>

<p><b>Flatchyannep</b>, a halfpenny.</p>

<p><b>Gen</b>, twelvepence, or one shilling. Formerly imagined to be an abbreviation
of argent, cant term for silver.</p>

<p><b>Generalize</b>, a shilling, almost invariably shortened to <span class="smcap lowercase">GEN</span>.</p>

<p><b>Genitraf</b>, a farthing.</p>

<p><b>Gen-net</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">NET GEN</span>, ten shillings.</p>

<p><b>Genol</b>, long.</p>

<p><b>Net nevis gen</b>, seventeen shillings.</p>

<p><b>Net rith gen</b>, thirteen shillings.</p>

<p><b>Net roaf gen</b>, fourteen shillings. It will be seen by the foregoing
that the reckoning is more by tens than by “teens.” This is, however,
matter of choice, and any one wishing to be considered accomplished
in this description of slang, must do as he thinks best&mdash;must lead and
not be led.</p>

<p><b>Sith-nom</b>, a month. This is because the slang was made from months,
not month. Perhaps because the latter was not easy; perhaps because
terms of imprisonment run longer than a month, and are often enumerated

<p><b>Taoc</b>, a coat. “Cool the <span class="smcap lowercase">DELO TAOC</span>” means, “Look at the old coat,”

<p><b>Trork</b>, a quart.</p>

<p><b>Trosseno</b>, literally, “one sort,” but professional slangists use it to imply
anything that is bad. <span class="smcap">Tross</span>, among costermongers, means anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
bad. It is probably a corruption of trash. Possibly, however, the
constant use of the words “dab-tros” may have led them in their unthinking
way to imagine that the latter word will do by itself.</p>

<p><b>Wedge</b>, a Jew. This may look strange, but it is exact back slang.</p>

<p><b>Wor-rab</b>, a barrow.</p>

<p><b>Yad</b>, a day; <span class="smcap lowercase">YADS</span>, days.</p>

<p><b>Yadnarb</b>, brandy.</p>

<p><b>Yannep</b>, a penny.</p>

<p><b>Yannep a time</b>, a penny each. Costermongers say “a time” for many
things. They say a “bob a time,” meaning a shilling each for admission
to a theatre, or any other place, or that certain articles are charged
a shilling each. The context is the only clue to the exact meaning.</p>

<p><b>Yannep-flatch</b>, three halfpence,&mdash;all the halfpence and pennies continue
in the same sequence, as for instance, <span class="smcap lowercase">OWT-YANNEP-FLATCH</span>, twopence-halfpenny.</p>

<p><b>Yap pu</b>, pay up.</p>

<p><b>Yeknod</b>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">JERK-NOD</span>, a donkey.</p>

<p><b>Yenork</b>, a crown.</p>

<p><b>Yob</b>, a boy.</p>

<p><b>Zeb</b>, best.</p>

<p>From these examples the apt student may fairly judge how to form his
own back slang to his own liking and that of his friends.</p>

<h2>SOME ACCOUNT<br />

<span class="small">OF</span><br />

THE RHYMING SLANG.</h2>


<p>There exists in London a singular tribe of men, known
amongst the “fraternity of vagabonds” as chaunters and
patterers. Both classes are great talkers. The first sing or
chaunt through the public thoroughfares ballads&mdash;political and
humorous&mdash;carols, dying speeches, and the various other kinds
of gallows and street literature. The second deliver street
orations on grease-removing compounds, plating powders, high-polishing
blacking, and the thousand-and-one wonderful penny-worths
that are retailed to gaping mobs from a London kerb-stone.</p>

<p>They are quite a distinct tribe from the costermongers; indeed,
amongst tramps, they term themselves the “harristocrats
of the streets,” and boast that they live by their intellects.
Like the costermongers, however, they have a secret tongue or
cant speech known only to each other. This cant, which has
nothing to do with that spoken by the costermongers, is known
in Seven Dials and elsewhere as the “rhyming slang,” or the
substitution of words and sentences which rhyme with other
words intended to be kept secret. The chaunter’s cant, therefore,
partakes of his calling, and he transforms and uses up into
a rough speech the various odds and ends of old songs, ballads,
and street nicknames, which are found suitable to his purpose.
Unlike nearly all other systems of cant, the rhyming slang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
is not founded upon allegory; unless we except a few rude
similes, thus&mdash;“I’m afloat” is the rhyming cant for “boat,”
“sorrowful tale” is equivalent to “three months in jail,” “artful
dodger” signifies a “lodger,” and a “snake in the grass” stands
for a “looking-glass”&mdash;a meaning that would delight a fat
Chinaman, or a collector of Oriental proverbs. But, as in the
case of the costers’ speech and the old gipsy-vagabond cant,
the chaunters and patterers so interlard this rhyming slang
with their general remarks, while their ordinary language is so
smothered and subdued, that, unless when they are professionally
engaged, and talking of their wares, they might almost pass
for foreigners.</p>

<p>From the inquiries I have made of various patterers and
“paper-workers,” I learn that the rhyming slang was introduced
about twelve or fifteen years ago.<a name="Anchor-61" id="Anchor-61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a> Numbering this
class of oratorical and bawling wanderers at twenty thousand,
scattered over Great Britain, including London and the large
provincial towns, we thus see the number of English vagabonds
who converse in rhyme and talk poetry, although their habitations
and mode of life constitute a very unpleasant Arcadia.
These nomadic poets, like the other talkers of cant or secret
languages, are stamped with the vagabond’s mark, and are continually
on the move. The married men mostly have lodgings
in London, and come and go as occasion may require. A few
never quit London streets, but the greater number tramp to all
the large provincial fairs, and prefer the “monkery” (country)
to town life. Some transact their business in a systematic way,
sending a post-office order to the Seven Dials’ printer for a
fresh supply of ballads or penny books, or to the “swag shop,”
as the case may be, for trinkets and gewgaws, to be sent on by
rail to a given town by the time they shall arrive there.</p>

<p>When any dreadful murder, colliery explosion, or frightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
railway accident has happened in a country district, three or
four chaunters are generally on the spot in a day or two after
the occurrence, vending and bawling “A True and Faithful
Account,” &amp;c., which “true and faithful account” was concocted
purely in the imaginations of the successors of Catnach
and Tommy Pitts,<a name="Anchor-62" id="Anchor-62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a> behind the counters of their printing-shops
in Seven Dials. And but few fairs are held in any part of
England without the patterer being punctually at his post, with
his nostrums, or real gold rings (with the story of the wager laid
by the gentleman&mdash;<i>see</i> <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#Fawney_bouncing">FAWNEY-BOUNCING</a></span>, in the Dictionary),
or savealls for candlesticks, or paste which, when applied to
the strop, makes the dullest razor keen enough to hack broom
handles and sticks, and after that to have quite enough sharpness
left for splitting hairs, or shaving them off the back of one
of the hands of a clodhopper, looking on in amazement. And
Cheap John, too, with his coarse jokes, and no end of six-bladed
knives, and pocket-books, containing information for
everybody, with pockets to hold money, and a pencil to write
with into the bargain, and a van stuffed with the cheap productions
of Sheffield and “Brummagem,”&mdash;he, too, is a patterer of
the highest order, and visits fairs, and can hold a conversation
in the rhyming slang.</p>

<p>Such is a rough description of the men who speak this jargon;
and simple and ridiculous as the vulgar scheme of a rhyming
slang may appear, it must always be regarded as a curious fact
in linguistic history. In order that the reader’s patience may
not be too much taxed, only a selection of rhyming words has
been given in the Glossary,&mdash;and these for the most part, as in
the case of the back slang, are the terms of every-day life, as
used by this order of tramps and hucksters.</p>

<div>
<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the chaunter or pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>terer
confines himself entirely to this slang when conveying
secret intelligence. On the contrary, although he speaks not a
“leash of languages,” yet is he master of the beggar’s cant, and
is thoroughly “up” in street slang. The following letter, written
by a chaunter to a gentleman who took an interest in his welfare,
will show his capabilities in this line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
Dear Friend,<a name="Anchor-63" id="Anchor-63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a>
</p>

<p>Excuse the liberty, since i saw you last i have not
earned a thick un, we have had such a Dowry of Parny that it

next. i hope you will oblige me if you can, for it will be the
means of putting a James in my Clye. i will call at your

family are All Square,</p>

<p><span class="sig">
I remain Your obedient Servant,</span><br />
<span class="signame">________</span>
</p></div>
</div>


<p>The numerous allusions in the Glossary to well-known places
in London show that this rude speech was mainly concocted in
the metropolis. The police have made themselves partially
acquainted with the back slang, but they are still profoundly
ignorant of the rhyming slang.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>NOTE.</h3>

<p>Since the foregoing was written, matters have changed considerably,
even, which I much doubt, if they ever were as is
stated; for, as I have already remarked, wherever opportunity
has occurred, the costermonger, the patterer, the chaunter, and
the various other itinerants who “work” London and the provinces,
delight in making themselves appear a most mysterious
body; and this, when added to their natural disinclination to
commit themselves to anything like fact so far as their natural
enemies&mdash;inquirers, and well-dressed inquirers in particular&mdash;are
concerned, has caused all sorts of extraordinary stories to
be set afloat, which have ultimately led to an opinion becoming
prevalent, that the costermonger and his friends form a race of
beings differing entirely from those who mix in the ordinary
humdrum routine of respectable life. Nothing could really be
much further from fact. Any one who has ever been driven
by stress of circumstances or curiosity to take up a permanent
or temporary residence in any of the lodging-houses which
abound in St. Giles’s, Saffron Hill, Turnmill Street, and in all
parts of the eastern district of the metropolis, will bear me out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
when I say that a more commonplace individual, so far as his
inner life is concerned, than the London itinerant cannot possibly
exist. Certainly he is ignorant, and takes a very limited
view of things in general, and religion and politics in particular;
but these peculiarities are held in common with his betters,
and so cannot be regarded as the special prerogative of any
class. If you ask him a question he will attempt to mislead
you, because, by your asking the question, he knows you are
ignorant of his way of life; and when he does not mystify from
love of mischief, as it appears he does from all published
books I have seen about him, he does so as a duty he owes
his natural enemies, the parish authorities and the tract
distributors, the latter of whom he holds in special abhorrence.</p>

<p>If the rhyming slang was ever, during its existence, regarded
as a secret language, its secrecy has long since departed
from it. Far easier of construction than even the back
slang, it has been common, especially in several printing-offices
I could name, for many years, while street-boys are great proficients
in its small mysteries. The Glossary which follows
here will explain a good deal of its mechanism; but it must be
borne in mind that the rhymes are all matters of individual
opinion, and that if one man says Allacompain means rain,
another is quite justified in preferring Mary Blane, if his individual
fancy lies in that direction. And now, if there is any
secret about the rhyming slang, it is this&mdash;the rhyme is left out.
This may at first seem extraordinary; but on reflection it will be
seen that there is no other way of making the proceedings of its
exponents puzzling to ordinarily sharp ears which have received
the slightest clue. Thus, when the first word of a series only
is used, and others in the sentence are made up from the back,
the centre and various slangs, there is some hope of fogging an
intruding listener to a private conversation. When a man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
drunk, the rhyming slang would illustrate that fact by the words
“Elephant’s trunk;” but the practised hand confines himself
to the statement that “Bill’s Elephants.” “Bullock’s horn”
represents to pawn, but an article is said to be “Bullocked”
only; and so on through the list, providing always that the
curtailment represents two syllables; if it does not, then the
entire rhyme is given.</p>

<p>I think that this will be sufficient to guide those readers
anxious to become proficient themselves, or to understand
others who are themselves proficient at this item in the world
of slang; and so I have nothing more to say except to call
attention to the fact that, in all the other introductions, I have
made my corrections, which have been neither few nor unimportant,
in the text; but that I could see no way of working
on the subject of the rhyming slang fairly and explicitly other
than by means of this note.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<h2>CENTRE SLANG.</h2>


<p>Within the past few years the desire to possess a mode
of intercommunication which shall be incomprehensible
to those who have not taken their degrees in vice, has led
the dangerous classes&mdash;particularly street-muggers, welchers,
skittle-sharps, jerry-hunters, and the various other gentlemen
who turn out every morning, when not in charge of the powers
that be, to look for their livings&mdash;to give their attention to
another twist in the English language, and so centre slang
has of late been heard with some degree of frequency by
those who penetrate to places where there is a likelihood
of finding anything new, and take with them sufficient knowledge
to comprehend it when, or if, it is found. As this
knowledge can never be acquired in any other way than by
actual observation, and is not to be obtained by hearsay, or
second-hand information, or from books, it is rarely brought to
bear upon any subject of this kind as treated in the newspapers,
and the articles on real low and criminal life which now and
again appear, though extremely amusing, amuse those about
whom they are written as much as they do those for whose information
they are produced. So, perhaps, those writers who have
heard centre slang, and have had opportunity of referring to it,
did not know what it was, or certainly, as an institution unique
in its way, it would have received some little attention. There
is not much in it, of course, as its origin shows, the key
being everything towards success in experimentalizing with it.
Centre slang, then, is formed by making the central vowel of a
word its initial letter, and adding vowels and consonants sufficient
to make the sound imposing, or, as cooks say, to flavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
palatably. An occasional infusion of back slang is now and
again considered advisable, but the taste of the speaker must
decide how much is requisite. Mug is a common word to signify
a fool or flat; this, in centre slang, becomes Ugmer, or
Hugmer, as the speaker likes, while fool and flat themselves
become Oolerfer and Atfler respectively. The aspirate can be
added, if relished, to any centre slang word. A welcher, by
means of the new slang, becomes an Elcherwer or Elchwer, a
thief is an Evethee, and a sticker-up of skittles is an Ickitser-pu.
As the inventors of this slang are not particular about spelling,
phonography is used extensively in its composition&mdash;that is, it
would be, if it were possible to write centre slang to any extent.
However, as it is a spoken language only, and no patent has
been taken out for its use, boldness is the chief essential for
any one possessed of a mobile tongue and a desire to become
expert. There is no Glossary of this slang necessary, as it is
only made up of small parcels, as occasion requires, and does
not keep well without guiding sentences attached.</p>

<h2>THE BIBLIOGRAPHY<br />

<span class="small">OF</span><br />

SLANG, CANT, AND VULGAR LANGUAGE:<br />

<span class="small">A LIST OF THE</span><br />

BOOKS CONSULTED IN COMPILING THIS WORK.</h2>


<p>Slang has a literary history, the same as authorized language.
More than one hundred works have treated upon
the subject in one form or other,&mdash;a few devoting but a chapter,
whilst many have given up their entire pages to expounding its
history and use. Old Harman, a worthy man, who interested
himself in suppressing and exposing vagabondism in the days
of good Queen Bess, was the first to write upon the subject.
Decker followed fifty years afterwards, but helped himself,
evidently, to his predecessor’s labours. Shakspeare, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and Brome, each employed beggars’
cant as part of the machinery of their plays. Then came Head
(who wrote <i>The English Rogue</i> in 1680) with a Glossary of cant
words “used by the Gipsies.” But it was only a reprint of
what Decker had given sixty years before. About this time
authorized dictionaries began to insert vulgar words, labelling
them “cant.” The Jack Sheppards and Dick Turpins of the
early and middle part of the last century made cant popular,
and many small works were published upon the subject. But
it was Grose, burly, facetious Grose, who, in the year 1785,
collected the scattered Glossaries of cant and secret words, and
formed one large work, adding to it all the vulgar words and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
slang terms used in his own day. The indelicacy and extreme
vulgarity of the work renders it unfit for ordinary use, still it
must be admitted that it is by far the most important work
which has ever appeared on street or popular language; indeed,
from its pages every succeeding work has, up to the present
time, drawn its contents. The great fault of Grose’s book consists
in the author not contenting himself with slang and cant
terms, but inserting every “smutty” and offensive word that
could be discovered. However, Harman and Grose are, after
all, the only authors who have as yet treated the subject in an
original manner, or who have written on it from personal
inquiry.</p>

<div class="bibcomment"><p>It is a curious fact connected with slang that a great number of vulgar words
common in England are equally common in the United States; and when
we remember that America began to be peopled two centuries ago, and that
these colloquialisms must have crossed the sea with the first emigrants, we
can form some idea of the antiquity of popular or street language. Many
words, owing to the caprices of fashion or society, have wholly disappeared
in the parent country, whilst in the colonies they are yet heard. The
words “skink,” to serve drink in company, and the old term “miching” or
“meeching,” skulking or playing truant, for instance, are still in use in the
United States, although nearly obsolete here.</p></div>

<div class="bibcomment"><p>The first edition of this book appears to have been printed at Augsburg, by
Erhard Oglin, or Ocellus, about 1514,&mdash;a small quarto of twelve leaves. It
was frequently reprinted at other places in Germany: and in 1528 there
appeared an edition at Wirtemberg, with a preface by Martin Luther,
who says that the “Rotwelsche Sprach,” the Cant language of the beggars,
comes from the Jews, as it contains many Hebrew words, as any one who
understands that language may perceive. This book is divided into three
parts, or sections; the first gives a special account of the several orders of
the “Fraternity of Vagabonds;” the second, sundry “<i>notabilia</i>” relating
to the different classes of beggars previously described; and the third consists
of a “Rotwelsche Vocabulary,” or “Canting Dictionary.” There is a long
notice of the “Liber Vagatorum” in the “Weimarisches Jahrbuch,” 10ter
Band, 1856. Mayhew, in his <i>London Labour</i>, states that many of our Cant
words are derived from the Jew fences. It is singular that a similar statement
should have been made by Martin Luther more than three centuries
before.</p></div>

is, whatever may be the reason, no disputing the truth of this latter statement,
as there is not, we venture to say, a common lodging-house in
London without broken-down gentlemen, who have been gentlemen very
often far beyond the conventional application of the term to any one with a
good coat on his back and money in his pocket.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a> Sometimes, as appears from the following, the names of persons and
houses are written instead. “In almost every one of the padding-kens, or
low lodging-houses in the country, there is a list of walks pasted up over
the kitchen mantelpiece. Now at St. Albans, for instance, at the &mdash;&mdash;,
and at other places, there is a paper stuck up in each of the kitchens. This
paper is headed, ‘Walks out of this town’ and underneath it is set
down the names of the villages in the neighbourhood at which a beggar may
call when out on his walk, and they are so arranged as to allow the cadger
to make a round of about six miles each day, and return the same night.
In many of these papers there are sometimes twenty walks set down. No
villages that are in any way ‘gammy’ [bad] are ever mentioned in these
papers, and the cadger, if he feels inclined to stop for a few days in the
town, will be told by the lodging-house keeper, or the other cadgers that
he may meet there, what gentlemen’s seats or private houses are of any
account on the walk that he means to take. The names of the good houses
are not set down in the paper, for fear of the police.”&mdash;<i>Mayhew</i>, vol. i.
p. 418. [This business is also much altered in consequence of the increase
in the surveillance of the kens, an increase which, though nominally for
sanitary purposes, has a strong moral effect. Besides this, Mr. Mayhew’s
informants seem to have possessed a fair share of that romance which is
inherent among vagabonds.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Crabb, who wrote the <i>Gipsies’ Advocate</i> in 1831, thus mentions the word:&mdash;“This
language [Gipsy] <i>called by themselves</i> Slang, or Gibberish, invented,
as they think, by their forefathers for secret purposes, is not merely the
language of one or a few of these wandering tribes, which are found in the

when his voice cracks his companion takes up. For this reason the business is as a
rule conducted by a man and woman, or sometimes by a woman and child. The writing

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
