    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University
      of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for
      surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly
      attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The
      regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it,
      the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that
      my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the
      enemy&rsquo;s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in
      the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in
      safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
      nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and
      attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of
      Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which
      shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen
      into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion
      and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse,
      and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
      undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the
      base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far
      as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the
      verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our
      Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last
      I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that
      a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me
      back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship
      &ldquo;Orontes,&rdquo; and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health
      irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to
      spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air&mdash;or
      as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a
      man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London,
      that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire
      are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel
      in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending
      such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming
      did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must
      either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or
      that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the
      latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and
      to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive
      domicile.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the
      Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round
      I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The
      sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant
      thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a
      particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in
      his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy,
      I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together
      in a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?&rdquo; he asked in
      undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. &ldquo;You
      are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by
      the time that we reached our destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my
      misfortunes. &ldquo;What are you up to now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for lodgings.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3"
       id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a> I answered. &ldquo;Trying to solve the
      problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a
      reasonable price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strange thing,&rdquo; remarked my companion; &ldquo;you are the second man
      to-day that has used that expression to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was the first?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He
      was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go
      halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too
      much for his purse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the
      expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to
      being alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know Sherlock Holmes yet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;perhaps you would not care for
      him as a constant companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is there against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in
      his ideas&mdash;an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I
      know he is a decent fellow enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A medical student, I suppose?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is
      well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I
      know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies
      are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the
      way knowledge which would astonish his professors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you never ask him what he was going in for?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
      communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to meet him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I am to lodge with anyone, I
      should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough
      yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan
      to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet
      this friend of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sure to be at the laboratory,&rdquo; returned my companion. &ldquo;He either
      avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night.
      If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other
      channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford
      gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take
      as a fellow-lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t blame me if you don&rsquo;t get on with him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I know
      nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in
      the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me
      responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get on it will be easy to part company,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;It
      seems to me, Stamford,&rdquo; I added, looking hard at my companion, &ldquo;that you
      have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow&rsquo;s
      temper so formidable, or what is it? Don&rsquo;t be mealy-mouthed about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not easy to express the inexpressible,&rdquo; he answered with a laugh.
      &ldquo;Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes&mdash;it approaches to
      cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of
      the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but
      simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the
      effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the
      same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact
      knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the
      subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking
      rather a bizarre shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beating the subjects!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at
      it with my own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you say he is not a medical student?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,
      and you must form your own impressions about him.&rdquo; As he spoke, we turned
      down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into
      a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed
      no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down
      the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured
      doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and
      led to the chemical laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.
      Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,
      test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.
      There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant
      table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and
      sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it! I&rsquo;ve found it,&rdquo;
       he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his
      hand. &ldquo;I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin, <a
      href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a>
      and by nothing else.&rdquo; Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could
      not have shone upon his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; said Stamford, introducing us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for
      which I should hardly have given him credit. &ldquo;You have been in
      Afghanistan, I perceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth did you know that?&rdquo; I asked in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said he, chuckling to himself. &ldquo;The question now is about
      hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but practically&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
      Don&rsquo;t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come
      over here now!&rdquo; He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew
      me over to the table at which he had been working. &ldquo;Let us have some fresh
      blood,&rdquo; he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off
      the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. &ldquo;Now, I add this small
      quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting
      mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot
      be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be
      able to obtain the characteristic reaction.&rdquo; As he spoke, he threw into
      the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a
      transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany
      colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass
      jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a
      child with a new toy. &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be a very delicate test,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain.
      So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is
      valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as
      well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there
      are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the
      penalty of their crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
      suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen
      or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are
      they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what
      are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why?
      Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; test,
      and there will no longer be any difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart
      and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to be congratulated,&rdquo; I remarked, considerably surprised at his
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would
      certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was
      Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,
      and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would
      have been decisive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,&rdquo; said Stamford with a laugh.
      &ldquo;You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the &lsquo;Police News of the
      Past.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting reading it might be made, too,&rdquo; remarked Sherlock
      Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. &ldquo;I
      have to be careful,&rdquo; he continued, turning to me with a smile, &ldquo;for I
      dabble with poisons a good deal.&rdquo; He held out his hand as he spoke, and I
      noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and
      discoloured with strong acids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came here on business,&rdquo; said Stamford, sitting down on a high
      three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot.
      &ldquo;My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that
      you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better
      bring you together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me.
      &ldquo;I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which would suit us
      down to the ground. You don&rsquo;t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always smoke &lsquo;ship&rsquo;s&rsquo; myself,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do
      experiments. Would that annoy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at
      times, and don&rsquo;t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am
      sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I&rsquo;ll soon be right. What have
      you to confess now? It&rsquo;s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of
      one another before they begin to live together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed at this cross-examination. &ldquo;I keep a bull pup,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I
      object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of
      ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when
      I&rsquo;m well, but those are the principal ones at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?&rdquo; he asked,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on the player,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;A well-played violin is a treat
      for the gods&mdash;a badly-played one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he cried, with a merry laugh. &ldquo;I think we may
      consider the thing as settled&mdash;that is, if the rooms are agreeable to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall we see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we&rsquo;ll go together and settle
      everything,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;noon exactly,&rdquo; said I, shaking his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, &ldquo;how
      the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just his little
      peculiarity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A good many people have wanted to know how he
      finds things out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a mystery is it?&rdquo; I cried, rubbing my hands. &ldquo;This is very piquant. I
      am much obliged to you for bringing us together. &lsquo;The proper study of
      mankind is man,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must study him, then,&rdquo; Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      find him a knotty problem, though. I&rsquo;ll wager he learns more about you
      than you about him. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
      interested in my new acquaintance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,
      <a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a>
      Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a
      couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room,
      cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable
      in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when
      divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we
      at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round
      from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me
      with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily
      employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage.
      That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves
      to our new surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his
      ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten
      at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in
      the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory,
      sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which
      appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could
      exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a
      reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa
      in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from
      morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant
      expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted
      to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his
      whole life forbidden such a notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims
      in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance
      were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In
      height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed
      to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during
      those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like
      nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin,
      too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of
      determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with
      chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I
      frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his
      fragile philosophical instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much
      this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break
      through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself.
      Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was
      my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health
      forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial,
      and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my
      daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little
      mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in
      endeavouring to unravel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,
      confirmed Stamford&rsquo;s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to
      have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in
      science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance
      into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,
      and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and
      minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would
      work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some
      definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the
      exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters
      unless he has some very good reason for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary
      literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.
      Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he
      might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when
      I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of
      the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in
      this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round
      the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could
      hardly realize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to be astonished,&rdquo; he said, smiling at my expression of
      surprise. &ldquo;Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To forget it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I consider that a man&rsquo;s brain originally is like
      a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you
      choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across,
      so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at
      best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty
      in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful
      indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but
      the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a
      large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to
      think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any
      extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of
      knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest
      importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful
      ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Solar System!&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is it to me?&rdquo; he interrupted impatiently; &ldquo;you say that we
      go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth
      of difference to me or to my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in
      his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I
      pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my
      deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did
      not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed
      was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the
      various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally
      well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help
      smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SHERLOCK HOLMES&mdash;his limits.
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. &ldquo;If
      I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these
      accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,&rdquo; I said
      to myself, &ldquo;I may as well give up the attempt at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were
      very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That
      he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my
      request he has played me some of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Lieder, and other
      favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any
      music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an
      evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which
      was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and
      melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they
      reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided
      those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or
      fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these
      exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by
      playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a
      slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think
      that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,
      however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most
      different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,
      dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came
      three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,
      fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same
      afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar,
      who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a
      slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman
      had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his
      velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an
      appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room,
      and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting
      me to this inconvenience. &ldquo;I have to use this room as a place of
      business,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and these people are my clients.&rdquo; Again I had an
      opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy
      prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the
      time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon
      dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I
      rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not
      yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my
      late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With
      the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt
      intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table
      and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched
      silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the
      heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its somewhat ambitious title was &ldquo;The Book of Life,&rdquo; and it attempted to
      show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic
      examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a
      remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close
      and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and
      exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a
      muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man&rsquo;s inmost thoughts. Deceit,
      according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to
      observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many
      propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the
      uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived
      at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a drop of water,&rdquo; said the writer, &ldquo;a logician could infer the
      possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of
      one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is
      known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the
      Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by
      long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to
      attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those
      moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest
      difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary
      problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to
      distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which
      he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the
      faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look
      for. By a man&rsquo;s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his
      trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his
      expression, by his shirt cuffs&mdash;by each of these things a man&rsquo;s
      calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the
      competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ineffable twaddle!&rdquo; I cried, slapping the magazine down on the
      table, &ldquo;I never read such rubbish in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this article,&rdquo; I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat
      down to my breakfast. &ldquo;I see that you have read it since you have marked
      it. I don&rsquo;t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is
      evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat
      little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I
      should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the
      Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I
      would lay a thousand to one against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would lose your money,&rdquo; Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. &ldquo;As for the
      article I wrote it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories
      which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical
      are really extremely practical&mdash;so practical that I depend upon them
      for my bread and cheese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how?&rdquo; I asked involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world.
      I&rsquo;m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in
      London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones.
      When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them
      on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am
      generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to
      set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds,
      and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is
      odd if you can&rsquo;t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known
      detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and
      that was what brought him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these other people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people
      who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I
      listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my
      fee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you mean to say,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that without leaving your room you can
      unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have
      seen every detail for themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns
      up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see
      things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I
      apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those
      rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are
      invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature.
      You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that
      you had come from Afghanistan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were told, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort. I <i>knew</i> you came from Afghanistan. From long
      habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived
      at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There
      were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, &lsquo;Here is a gentleman
      of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army
      doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and
      that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has
      undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His
      left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner.
      Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship
      and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.&rsquo; The whole train of
      thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from
      Afghanistan, and you were astonished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simple enough as you explain it,&rdquo; I said, smiling. &ldquo;You remind me
      of Edgar Allen Poe&rsquo;s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist
      outside of stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. &ldquo;No doubt you think that you are
      complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Now, in my
      opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking
      in on his friends&rsquo; thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an
      hour&rsquo;s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some
      analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as
      Poe appeared to imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read Gaboriau&rsquo;s works?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Does Lecoq come up to your
      idea of a detective?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. &ldquo;Lecoq was a miserable bungler,&rdquo; he
      said, in an angry voice; &ldquo;he had only one thing to recommend him, and that
      was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to
      identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours.
      Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives
      to teach them what to avoid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired
      treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood
      looking out into the busy street. &ldquo;This fellow may be very clever,&rdquo; I said
      to myself, &ldquo;but he is certainly very conceited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,&rdquo; he said,
      querulously. &ldquo;What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know
      well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever
      lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to
      the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is
      no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so
      transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it
      best to change the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what that fellow is looking for?&rdquo; I asked, pointing to a
      stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other
      side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue
      envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brag and bounce!&rdquo; thought I to myself. &ldquo;He knows that I cannot verify his
      guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were
      watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across
      the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps
      ascending the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; he said, stepping into the room and handing my
      friend the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little
      thought of this when he made that random shot. &ldquo;May I ask, my lad,&rdquo; I
      said, in the blandest voice, &ldquo;what your trade may be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commissionaire, sir,&rdquo; he said, gruffly. &ldquo;Uniform away for repairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were?&rdquo; I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.
    </p>

      CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY <a href="#linknote-6"
       name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the
      practical nature of my companion&rsquo;s theories. My respect for his powers of
      analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion
      in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode,
      intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking
      me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he had finished
      reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre
      expression which showed mental abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world did you deduce that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deduce what?&rdquo; said he, petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time for trifles,&rdquo; he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,
      &ldquo;Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it
      is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a
      sergeant of Marines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were asked
      to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and
      yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a
      great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow&rsquo;s hand. That smacked
      of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side
      whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of
      self-importance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the
      way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable,
      middle-aged man, too, on the face of him&mdash;all facts which led me to
      believe that he had been a sergeant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; I ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commonplace,&rdquo; said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he
      was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. &ldquo;I said just now that
      there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong&mdash;look at this!&rdquo;
       He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought. <a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I cried, as I cast my eye over it, &ldquo;this is terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem to be a little out of the common,&rdquo; he remarked, calmly.
      &ldquo;Would you mind reading it to me aloud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is the letter which I read to him&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,
      off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in
      the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something
      was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of
      furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having
      cards in his pocket bearing the name of &lsquo;Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland,
      Ohio, U.S.A.&rsquo; There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to
      how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there
      is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the
      empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round
      to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left
      everything <i>in statu quo</i> until I hear from you. If you are unable to
      come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness
      if you would favour me with your opinion. Yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TOBIAS GREGSON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,&rdquo; my friend remarked; &ldquo;he
      and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic,
      but conventional&mdash;shockingly so. They have their knives into one
      another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties.
      There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the
      scent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. &ldquo;Surely there is not
      a moment to be lost,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;shall I go and order you a cab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil
      that ever stood in shoe leather&mdash;that is, when the fit is on me, for
      I can be spry enough at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the whole
      matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all
      the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he begs you to help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he
      would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.
      However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own
      hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an
      energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your hat,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish me to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you have nothing better to do.&rdquo; A minute later we were both in a
      hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the
      house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets
      beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about
      Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati.
      As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy
      business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,&rdquo; I said at
      last, interrupting Holmes&rsquo; musical disquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No data yet,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is a capital mistake to theorize before
      you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have your data soon,&rdquo; I remarked, pointing with my finger; &ldquo;this
      is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much
      mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is. Stop, driver, stop!&rdquo; We were still a hundred yards or so from
      it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was
      one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being
      occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant
      melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there
      a &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A
      small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants
      separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a
      narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a
      mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the
      rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a
      three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and
      against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a
      small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in
      the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the
      house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be
      further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the
      circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and
      down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite
      houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he
      proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which
      flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he
      stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of
      satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil,
      but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to
      see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had
      such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties,
      that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired
      man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my
      companion&rsquo;s hand with effusion. &ldquo;It is indeed kind of you to come,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I have had everything left untouched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except that!&rdquo; my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. &ldquo;If a herd of
      buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt,
      however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had so much to do inside the house,&rdquo; the detective said evasively.
      &ldquo;My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. &ldquo;With two such
      men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a
      third party to find out,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. &ldquo;I think we have done
      all that can be done,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a queer case though, and I knew
      your taste for such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not come here in a cab?&rdquo; asked Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor Lestrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us go and look at the room.&rdquo; With which inconsequent remark he
      strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed
      his astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.
      Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had
      obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the
      dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had
      occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling
      at my heart which the presence of death inspires.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all
      furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched
      in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached
      and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was
      a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble.
      On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The
      solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving
      a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer
      of dust which coated the whole apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was
      centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon
      the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured
      ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of
      age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a
      short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and
      waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs.
      A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him.
      His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs
      were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On
      his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to
      me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This
      malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt
      nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and
      ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural
      posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me
      in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked
      out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and
      greeted my companion and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This case will make a stir, sir,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It beats anything I have
      seen, and I am no chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no clue?&rdquo; said Gregson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; chimed in Lestrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it
      intently. &ldquo;You are sure that there is no wound?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to
      numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positive!&rdquo; cried both detectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual&mdash;<a
      href="#linknote-8" name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
      presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of
      the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the
      year &lsquo;34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it up&mdash;you really should. There is nothing new under the sun.
      It has all been done before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,
      feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same
      far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the
      examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with
      which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man&rsquo;s lips, and then
      glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not been moved at all?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take him to the mortuary now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is nothing more to
      be learned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the
      room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a
      ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and
      stared at it with mystified eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a woman here,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s wedding-ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered
      round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of
      plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This complicates matters,&rdquo; said Gregson. &ldquo;Heaven knows, they were
      complicated enough before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it doesn&rsquo;t simplify them?&rdquo; observed Holmes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
      to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have it all here,&rdquo; said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon
      one of the bottom steps of the stairs. &ldquo;A gold watch, No. 97163, by
      Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,
      with masonic device. Gold pin&mdash;bull-dog&rsquo;s head, with rubies as eyes.
      Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,
      corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money
      to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Decameron,&rsquo; with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two letters&mdash;one
      addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;American Exchange, Strand&mdash;to be left till called for. They are both
      from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats
      from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return
      to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it at once, sir,&rdquo; said Gregson. &ldquo;I have had advertisements sent to
      all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange,
      but he has not returned yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sent to Cleveland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We telegraphed this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you word your inquiries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of
      any information which could help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be
      crucial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked about Stangerson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears
      to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said all I have to say,&rdquo; said Gregson, in an offended voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some
      remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were
      holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing
      his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gregson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have just made a discovery of the highest
      importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a
      careful examination of the walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a
      state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his
      colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which
      felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. &ldquo;Now, stand there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; he said, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this
      particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a
      yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was
      scrawled in blood-red letters a single word&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         RACHE.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; cried the detective, with the air of a
      showman exhibiting his show. &ldquo;This was overlooked because it was in the
      darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The
      murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it
      has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow.
      Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that
      candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this
      corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does it mean now that you <i>have</i> found it?&rdquo; asked Gregson
      in a depreciatory voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name
      Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my
      words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman
      named Rachel has something to do with it. It&rsquo;s all very well for you to
      laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old
      hound is the best, when all is said and done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really beg your pardon!&rdquo; said my companion, who had ruffled the little
      man&rsquo;s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. &ldquo;You certainly
      have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you
      say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant
      in last night&rsquo;s mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but
      with your permission I shall do so now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass
      from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about
      the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat
      upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to
      have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his
      breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans,
      whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I
      watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained
      foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining
      in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes
      or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care
      the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and
      occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible
      manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey
      dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he
      examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of
      it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied,
      for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,&rdquo; he
      remarked with a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very bad definition, but it does apply to
      detective work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres <a href="#linknote-9"
       name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a> of their
      amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They
      evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize,
      that Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; smallest actions were all directed towards some
      definite and practical end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it, sir?&rdquo; they both asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to
      help you,&rdquo; remarked my friend. &ldquo;You are doing so well now that it would be
      a pity for anyone to interfere.&rdquo; There was a world of sarcasm in his voice
      as he spoke. &ldquo;If you will let me know how your investigations go,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;I shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I
      should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me
      his name and address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lestrade glanced at his note-book. &ldquo;John Rance,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is off duty
      now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes took a note of the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Doctor,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we shall go and look him up. I&rsquo;ll tell you
      one thing which may help you in the case,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the
      two detectives. &ldquo;There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man.
      He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet
      for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly
      cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn
      by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In
      all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of
      his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but
      they may assist you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this man was murdered, how was it done?&rdquo; asked the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. &ldquo;One other thing,
      Lestrade,&rdquo; he added, turning round at the door: &ldquo;&lsquo;Rache,&rsquo; is the German
      for &lsquo;revenge;&rsquo; so don&rsquo;t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals
      open-mouthed behind him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was one o&rsquo;clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes
      led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long
      telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the
      address given us by Lestrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing like first hand evidence,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;as a matter of
      fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well
      learn all that is to be learned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amaze me, Holmes,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Surely you are not as sure as you pretend
      to be of all those particulars which you gave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no room for a mistake,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The very first thing which
      I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its
      wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a
      week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have
      been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs,
      too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the
      other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there
      after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning&mdash;I
      have Gregson&rsquo;s word for that&mdash;it follows that it must have been there
      during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to
      the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems simple enough,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but how about the other man&rsquo;s
      height?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the
      length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is
      no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow&rsquo;s stride both on the
      clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my
      calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write
      about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet
      from the ground. It was child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his age?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest
      effort, he can&rsquo;t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of
      a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.
      Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.
      There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life
      a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in
      that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The writing on the wall was done with a man&rsquo;s forefinger dipped in blood.
      My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in
      doing it, which would not have been the case if the man&rsquo;s nail had been
      trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in
      colour and flakey&mdash;such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I
      have made a special study of cigar ashes&mdash;in fact, I have written a
      monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a
      glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is
      just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson
      and Lestrade type.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the florid face?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right.
      You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I passed my hand over my brow. &ldquo;My head is in a whirl,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;the
      more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men&mdash;if
      there were two men&mdash;into an empty house? What has become of the
      cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?
      Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since
      robbery had no part in it? How came the woman&rsquo;s ring there? Above all, why
      should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I
      confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these
      facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion smiled approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my
      mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade&rsquo;s discovery it was simply a
      blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting
      Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you
      noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German
      invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that
      this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his
      part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I&rsquo;m not
      going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets
      no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much
      of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very
      ordinary individual after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never do that,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;you have brought detection as near
      an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in
      which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to
      flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one other thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Patent leathers <a
      href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
      and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway
      together as friendly as possible&mdash;arm-in-arm, in all probability.
      When they got inside they walked up and down the room&mdash;or rather,
      Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I could
      read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more
      and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He
      was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury.
      Then the tragedy occurred. I&rsquo;ve told you all I know myself now, for the
      rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis,
      however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle&rsquo;s
      concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way
      through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the
      dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Audley Court in there,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the
      line of dead-coloured brick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me here when you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us
      into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We
      picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of
      discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was
      decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved.
      On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into
      a little front parlour to await his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in
      his slumbers. &ldquo;I made my report at the office,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively.
      &ldquo;We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,&rdquo; the constable answered
      with his eyes upon the little golden disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though
      determined not to omit anything in his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell it ye from the beginning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My time is from ten at
      night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the &lsquo;White
      Hart&rsquo;; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o&rsquo;clock it
      began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher&mdash;him who has the Holland Grove
      beat&mdash;and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street
      a-talkin&rsquo;. Presently&mdash;maybe about two or a little after&mdash;I
      thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the
      Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all
      the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin&rsquo; down,
      thinkin&rsquo; between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be,
      when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that
      same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was
      empty on account of him that owns them who won&rsquo;t have the drains seen to,
      though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o&rsquo; typhoid
      fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the
      window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,&rdquo; my companion
      interrupted. &ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost
      amazement upon his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s true, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;though how you come to know it, Heaven
      only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so
      lonesome, that I thought I&rsquo;d be none the worse for some one with me. I
      ain&rsquo;t afeared of anything on this side o&rsquo; the grave; but I thought that
      maybe it was him that died o&rsquo; the typhoid inspecting the drains what
      killed him. The thought gave me a kind o&rsquo; turn, and I walked back to the
      gate to see if I could see Murcher&rsquo;s lantern, but there wasn&rsquo;t no sign of
      him nor of anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no one in the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a livin&rsquo; soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself
      together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so
      I went into the room where the light was a-burnin&rsquo;. There was a candle
      flickerin&rsquo; on the mantelpiece&mdash;a red wax one&mdash;and by its light I
      saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,
      and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the
      kitchen door, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his
      eyes. &ldquo;Where was you hid to see all that?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It seems to me that
      you knows a deal more than you should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get arresting me for the murder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am one of the hounds
      and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on,
      though. What did you do next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.
      &ldquo;I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and
      two more to the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the street empty then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constable&rsquo;s features broadened into a grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen many a drunk
      chap in my time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but never anyone so cryin&rsquo; drunk as that cove.
      He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin&rsquo; up agin the railings, and
      a-singin&rsquo; at the pitch o&rsquo; his lungs about Columbine&rsquo;s New-fangled Banner,
      or some such stuff. He couldn&rsquo;t stand, far less help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a man was he?&rdquo; asked Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. &ldquo;He was
      an uncommon drunk sort o&rsquo; man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; found hisself in the
      station if we hadn&rsquo;t been so took up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His face&mdash;his dress&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you notice them?&rdquo; Holmes broke in
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up&mdash;me
      and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower
      part muffled round&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; cried Holmes. &ldquo;What became of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d enough to do without lookin&rsquo; after him,&rdquo; the policeman said, in an
      aggrieved voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager he found his way home all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was he dressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brown overcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he a whip in his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A whip&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have left it behind,&rdquo; muttered my companion. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t happen
      to see or hear a cab after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a half-sovereign for you,&rdquo; my companion said, standing up and
      taking his hat. &ldquo;I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the
      force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might
      have gained your sergeant&rsquo;s stripes last night. The man whom you held in
      your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are
      seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you that it is
      so. Come along, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,
      but obviously uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blundering fool,&rdquo; Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our
      lodgings. &ldquo;Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good
      luck, and not taking advantage of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this
      man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why
      should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way of
      criminals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no
      other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I
      shall have him, Doctor&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lay you two to one that I have him. I
      must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have
      missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t we use a little art jargon. There&rsquo;s the scarlet thread of murder
      running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel
      it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for lunch, and
      then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are splendid. What&rsquo;s
      that little thing of Chopin&rsquo;s she plays so magnificently:
      Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark
      while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      OUR morning&rsquo;s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was
      tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes&rsquo; departure for the concert, I lay
      down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours&rsquo; sleep. It was
      a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had
      occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every
      time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like
      countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that
      face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but
      gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human
      features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly
      those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice
      must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment <a
      href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a>
      in the eyes of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion&rsquo;s
      hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he
      had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something
      which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had
      caused the man&rsquo;s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of
      strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so
      thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the
      victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long
      as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy
      matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident manner
      convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the
      facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very late in returning&mdash;so late, that I knew that the concert
      could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before
      he appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was magnificent,&rdquo; he said, as he took his seat. &ldquo;Do you remember what
      Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and
      appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of
      speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by
      it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when
      the world was in its childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a broad idea,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&rsquo;s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,&rdquo;
       he answered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? You&rsquo;re not looking quite yourself. This
      Brixton Road affair has upset you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, it has,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I ought to be more case-hardened
      after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at
      Maiwand without losing my nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the
      imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you
      seen the evening paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the
      fact that when the man was raised up, a woman&rsquo;s wedding ring fell upon the
      floor. It is just as well it does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at this advertisement,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I had one sent to every paper
      this morning immediately after the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It
      was the first announcement in the &ldquo;Found&rdquo; column. &ldquo;In Brixton Road, this
      morning,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between
      the &lsquo;White Hart&rsquo; Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker
      Street, between eight and nine this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my using your name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I used my own some of these
      dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But supposing anyone applies, I have no
      ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, you have,&rdquo; said he, handing me one. &ldquo;This will do very well. It
      is almost a facsimile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the man in the brown coat&mdash;our florid friend with the square
      toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he not consider it as too dangerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to
      believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the
      ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber&rsquo;s
      body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he
      discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in
      possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had
      to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have
      been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that man&rsquo;s
      place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it
      was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the
      house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the evening
      papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of
      course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a
      trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring
      should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You
      shall see him within an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and
      though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the
      pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite
      occupation of scraping upon his violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plot thickens,&rdquo; he said, as I entered; &ldquo;I have just had an answer to
      my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo; I asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fiddle would be the better for new strings,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Put your
      pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary
      way. Leave the rest to me. Don&rsquo;t frighten him by looking at him too hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is eight o&rsquo;clock now,&rdquo; I said, glancing at my watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly.
      That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a queer
      old book I picked up at a stall yesterday&mdash;&lsquo;De Jure inter Gentes&rsquo;&mdash;published
      in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles&rsquo; head was still firm
      on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the printer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very
      faded ink, is written &lsquo;Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.&rsquo; I wonder who William
      Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His
      writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose
      softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the
      servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Dr. Watson live here?&rdquo; asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We
      could not hear the servant&rsquo;s reply, but the door closed, and some one
      began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling
      one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he
      listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble
      tap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old
      and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled
      by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood
      blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with
      nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face had
      assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep
      my countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,&rdquo; she said, dropping another
      curtsey; &ldquo;a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl
      Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is
      steward aboard a Union boat, and what he&rsquo;d say if he come &lsquo;ome and found
      her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at
      the best o&rsquo; times, but more especially when he has the drink. If it please
      you, she went to the circus last night along with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that her ring?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord be thanked!&rdquo; cried the old woman; &ldquo;Sally will be a glad woman
      this night. That&rsquo;s the ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may your address be?&rdquo; I inquired, taking up a pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,&rdquo; said
      Sherlock Holmes sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little
      red-rimmed eyes. &ldquo;The gentleman asked me for <i>my</i> address,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your name is&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Sawyer&mdash;her&rsquo;s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her&mdash;and
      a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he&rsquo;s at sea, and no steward in the
      company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what
      with liquor shops&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,&rdquo; I interrupted, in obedience to a sign
      from my companion; &ldquo;it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to
      be able to restore it to the rightful owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone
      packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock
      Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his
      room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow her,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly; &ldquo;she must be an accomplice, and
      will lead me to him. Wait up for me.&rdquo; The hall door had hardly slammed
      behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through
      the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her
      pursuer dogged her some little distance behind. &ldquo;Either his whole theory
      is incorrect,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;or else he will be led now to the
      heart of the mystery.&rdquo; There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for
      him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might
      be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of
      Henri Murger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vie de Bohème.&rdquo; Ten o&rsquo;clock passed, and I heard the
      footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more
      stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same
      destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of
      his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not
      been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the
      mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a
      hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,&rdquo; he cried,
      dropping into his chair; &ldquo;I have chaffed them so much that they would
      never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I
      know that I will be even with them in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a
      little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore.
      Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing.
      I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not
      have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the
      other side of the street, &lsquo;Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,&rsquo; she
      cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely
      inside, I perched myself behind. That&rsquo;s an art which every detective
      should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until
      we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the
      door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab
      pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand
      expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping
      about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted
      collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of
      his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On
      inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable
      paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer
      or Dennis had ever been heard of there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; I cried, in amazement, &ldquo;that that tottering,
      feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,
      without either you or the driver seeing her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old woman be damned!&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. &ldquo;We were the old
      women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one,
      too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was inimitable. He
      saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the
      slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he
      was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him. Now, Doctor,
      you are looking done-up. Take my advice and turn in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left
      Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches
      of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew
      that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set
      himself to unravel.

      CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE papers next day were full of the &ldquo;Brixton Mystery,&rdquo; as they termed it.
      Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in
      addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still
      retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the
      case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> remarked that in the history of crime there had
      seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name
      of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister
      inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political
      refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in America,
      and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been
      tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua
      tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory,
      the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article
      concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over
      foreigners in England.

    <p>
      The <i>Standard</i> commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the
      sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the
      unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all
      authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing
      for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of
      Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in
      his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade
      adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to
      Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool
      express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing
      more is known of them until Mr. Drebber&rsquo;s body was, as recorded,
      discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston.
      How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still
      involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We
      are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are
      both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these
      well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Daily News</i> observed that there was no doubt as to the crime
      being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which
      animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our
      shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they
      not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these
      men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was
      punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,
      Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the
      deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of
      the house at which he had boarded&mdash;a result which was entirely due to
      the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and
      they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to
      score.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on how it turns out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless you, it doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it
      will be <i>on account</i> of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be <i>in
      spite</i> of their exertions. It&rsquo;s heads I win and tails you lose.
      Whatever they do, they will have followers. &lsquo;Un sot trouve toujours un
      plus sot qui l&rsquo;admire.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is this?&rdquo; I cried, for at this moment there came the
      pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by
      audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,&rdquo; said my
      companion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a
      dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped
      eyes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tention!&rdquo; cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little
      scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. &ldquo;In
      future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must
      wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, we hain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said one of the youths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your
      wages.&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13" id="linknoteref-13"><small>13</small></a>
      He handed each of them a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats,
      and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out
      of a dozen of the force,&rdquo; Holmes remarked. &ldquo;The mere sight of an
      official-looking person seals men&rsquo;s lips. These youngsters, however, go
      everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all
      they want is organisation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of
      time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is
      Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of
      his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired
      detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our
      sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he cried, wringing Holmes&rsquo; unresponsive hand,
      &ldquo;congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion&rsquo;s expressive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you are on the right track?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty&rsquo;s navy,&rdquo; cried Gregson,
      pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are anxious to
      know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; the detective answered. &ldquo;The tremendous exertions
      which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not
      so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You
      will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me too much honour,&rdquo; said Holmes, gravely. &ldquo;Let us hear how you
      arrived at this most gratifying result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at
      his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fun of it is,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself
      so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the
      secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe
      unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you get your clue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is
      strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend
      with was the finding of this American&rsquo;s antecedents. Some people would
      have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties
      came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson&rsquo;s way
      of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Holmes; &ldquo;by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea that you noticed that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you been there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; &ldquo;you should never neglect a
      chance, however small it may seem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a great mind, nothing is little,&rdquo; remarked Holmes, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that
      size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He
      had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier&rsquo;s Boarding
      Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smart&mdash;very smart!&rdquo; murmured Sherlock Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I next called upon Madame Charpentier,&rdquo; continued the detective. &ldquo;I found
      her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too&mdash;an
      uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and
      her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn&rsquo;t escape my notice. I began
      to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come
      upon the right scent&mdash;a kind of thrill in your nerves. &lsquo;Have you
      heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber,
      of Cleveland?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother nodded. She didn&rsquo;t seem able to get out a word. The daughter
      burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something
      of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At what o&rsquo;clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?&rsquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her
      agitation. &lsquo;His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains&mdash;one
      at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first. <a href="#linknote-14"
       name="linknoteref-14" id="linknoteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And was that the last which you saw of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A terrible change came over the woman&rsquo;s face as I asked the question. Her
      features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get
      out the single word &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;&mdash;and when it did come it was in a husky
      unnatural tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm
      clear voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Let us be frank
      with this gentleman. We <i>did</i> see Mr. Drebber again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;God forgive you!&rsquo; cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and
      sinking back in her chair. &lsquo;You have murdered your brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,&rsquo; the girl answered firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You had best tell me all about it now,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Half-confidences are
      worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On your head be it, Alice!&rsquo; cried her mother; and then, turning to me,
      &lsquo;I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of
      my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this
      terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that
      in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised.
      That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his
      antecedents would all forbid it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,&rsquo; I answered.
      &lsquo;Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,&rsquo; she said, and her
      daughter withdrew. &lsquo;Now, sir,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;I had no intention of
      telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have
      no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without
      omitting any particular.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is your wisest course,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary,
      Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a
      &ldquo;Copenhagen&rdquo; label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been
      their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his
      employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his
      habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became
      very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o&rsquo;clock in the
      day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the
      maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he
      speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke
      to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to
      understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and
      embraced her&mdash;an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach
      him for his unmanly conduct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But why did you stand all this,&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;I suppose that you can get
      rid of your boarders when you wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. &lsquo;Would to God that I
      had given him notice on the very day that he came,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;But it was
      a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each&mdash;fourteen
      pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in
      the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the
      best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on
      account of it. That was the reason of his going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just
      now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is
      violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the door
      behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an
      hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had
      returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He
      forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and
      made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned
      to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly
      with him. &ldquo;You are of age,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and there is no law to stop you. I
      have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come
      along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess.&rdquo; Poor
      Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her
      by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and
      at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do
      not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too
      terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in
      the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that fine
      fellow will trouble us again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will just go after him and see
      what he does with himself.&rdquo; With those words he took his hat and started
      off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber&rsquo;s mysterious
      death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier&rsquo;s lips with many gasps and
      pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I
      made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should
      be no possibility of a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite exciting,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. &ldquo;What happened
      next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mrs. Charpentier paused,&rdquo; the detective continued, &ldquo;I saw that the
      whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I
      always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;After you went to bed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When did you go to bed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;About eleven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So your son was gone at least two hours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Possibly four or five?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What was he doing during that time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; she answered, turning white to her very lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where
      Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him.
      When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us,
      he answered us as bold as brass, &lsquo;I suppose you are arresting me for being
      concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,&rsquo; he said. We had said
      nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious
      aspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having
      with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your theory, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.
      When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which
      Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach,
      perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet
      that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into
      the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the
      wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on
      to the wrong scent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said Holmes in an encouraging voice. &ldquo;Really, Gregson, you
      are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,&rdquo; the detective
      answered proudly. &ldquo;The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said
      that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took
      a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old
      shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old
      shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the
      whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of
      Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won&rsquo;t
      make much of <a href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15"
       id="linknoteref-15"><small>15</small></a> Why, by Jove, here&rsquo;s the very
      man himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking,
      and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness which generally
      marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was
      disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He
      had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes,
      for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out.
      He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and
      uncertain what to do. &ldquo;This is a most extraordinary case,&rdquo; he said at last&mdash;&ldquo;a
      most incomprehensible affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!&rdquo; cried Gregson, triumphantly. &ldquo;I
      thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the
      Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,&rdquo; said Lestrade gravely, &ldquo;was
      murdered at Halliday&rsquo;s Private Hotel about six o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so
      unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang out
      of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in
      silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn
      down over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stangerson too!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The plot thickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was quite thick enough before,&rdquo; grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. &ldquo;I
      seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you sure of this piece of intelligence?&rdquo; stammered
      Gregson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just come from his room,&rdquo; said Lestrade. &ldquo;I was the first to
      discover what had occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been hearing Gregson&rsquo;s view of the matter,&rdquo; Holmes observed.
      &ldquo;Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no objection,&rdquo; Lestrade answered, seating himself. &ldquo;I freely
      confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the
      death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was
      completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what
      had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station
      about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning
      Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted
      me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the
      time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to
      Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a
      watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the
      hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued
      that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course
      for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night,
      and then to hang about the station again next morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,&rdquo; remarked
      Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries
      entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight
      o&rsquo;clock I reached Halliday&rsquo;s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my
      enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once
      answered me in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,&rsquo; they said. &lsquo;He
      has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where is he now?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will go up and see him at once,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead
      him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room:
      it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to
      it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs
      again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my
      twenty years&rsquo; experience. From under the door there curled a little red
      ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a
      little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which
      brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was
      locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in.
      The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up,
      lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been
      for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over,
      the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had
      engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death
      was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart.
      And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was
      above the murdered man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even
      before Sherlock Holmes answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was it,&rdquo; said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all
      silent for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds
      of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his
      crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled
      as I thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man was seen,&rdquo; continued Lestrade. &ldquo;A milk boy, passing on his way to
      the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the
      back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was
      raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide
      open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He
      came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some
      carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of
      him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at
      work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and
      was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some
      little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the
      basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had
      deliberately wiped his knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which
      tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of
      exultation or satisfaction upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the
      murderer?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber&rsquo;s purse in his pocket, but it seems that
      this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in
      it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these
      extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no
      papers or memoranda in the murdered man&rsquo;s pocket, except a single
      telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the
      words, &lsquo;J. H. is in Europe.&rsquo; There was no name appended to this message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there was nothing else?&rdquo; Holmes asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of any importance. The man&rsquo;s novel, with which he had read
      himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair
      beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the
      window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last link,&rdquo; he cried, exultantly. &ldquo;My case is complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two detectives stared at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have now in my hands,&rdquo; my companion said, confidently, &ldquo;all the threads
      which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be
      filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that
      Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the
      body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give
      you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have them,&rdquo; said Lestrade, producing a small white box; &ldquo;I took them
      and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of
      safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these
      pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them here,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Now, Doctor,&rdquo; turning to me, &ldquo;are those
      ordinary pills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round,
      and almost transparent against the light. &ldquo;From their lightness and
      transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,&rdquo; I
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so,&rdquo; answered Holmes. &ldquo;Now would you mind going down and
      fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,
      and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It&rsquo;s laboured
      breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed,
      its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual
      term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will now cut one of these pills in two,&rdquo; said Holmes, and drawing his
      penknife he suited the action to the word. &ldquo;One half we return into the
      box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,
      in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the
      Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be very interesting,&rdquo; said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one
      who suspects that he is being laughed at, &ldquo;I cannot see, however, what it
      has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has
      everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the
      mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it
      up readily enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and
      placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock
      Holmes&rsquo; earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in
      silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling
      effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched
      upon tho <a href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16"><small>16</small></a>
      cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better
      nor the worse for its draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without
      result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared
      upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table,
      and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his
      emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives
      smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a coincidence,&rdquo; he cried, at last springing from his chair
      and pacing wildly up and down the room; &ldquo;it is impossible that it should
      be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of
      Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are
      inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have
      been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse.
      Ah, I have it! I have it!&rdquo; With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to
      the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and
      presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature&rsquo;s tongue seemed
      hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in
      every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead. &ldquo;I should have more faith,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I ought to know by this
      time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions,
      it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation.
      Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the
      other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw
      the box at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly
      believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however,
      to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the
      mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a
      dim, vague perception of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this seems strange to you,&rdquo; continued Holmes, &ldquo;because you failed at
      the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real
      clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon
      that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm
      my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it.
      Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have
      served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake
      to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often
      the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from
      which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more
      difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in
      the roadway without any of those <i>outré</i> and sensational
      accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details,
      far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of
      making it less so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable
      impatience, could contain himself no longer. &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Sherlock
      Holmes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart
      man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something more
      than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking the
      man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier
      could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his
      man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out
      hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the
      time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how
      much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,&rdquo; remarked Lestrade. &ldquo;We
      have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once
      since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you
      require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any delay in arresting the assassin,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;might give him time to
      perpetrate some fresh atrocity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued
      to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows
      drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no more murders,&rdquo; he said at last, stopping abruptly and
      facing us. &ldquo;You can put that consideration out of the question. You have
      asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his
      name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our
      hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of
      managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs
      delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with,
      who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as
      clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a
      clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest
      suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the
      four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt
      either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be
      more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked
      your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to
      this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to
      promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without
      endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or
      by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had
      flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other&rsquo;s beady eyes
      glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to
      speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of
      the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and
      unsavoury person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; he said, touching his forelock, &ldquo;I have the cab
      downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; said Holmes, blandly. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you introduce this pattern at
      Scotland Yard?&rdquo; he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a
      drawer. &ldquo;See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old pattern is good enough,&rdquo; remarked Lestrade, &ldquo;if we can only find
      the man to put them on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, very good,&rdquo; said Holmes, smiling. &ldquo;The cabman may as well help
      me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to
      set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There
      was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to
      strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,&rdquo; he said, kneeling over his
      task, and never turning his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down
      his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling
      of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he cried, with flashing eyes, &ldquo;let me introduce you to Mr.
      Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole thing occurred in a moment&mdash;so quickly that I had no time
      to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes&rsquo; 
      triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman&rsquo;s dazed,
      savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared
      as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a
      group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner
      wrenched himself free from Holmes&rsquo;s grasp, and hurled himself through the
      window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but before he got quite
      through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many
      staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a
      terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us
      were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive
      strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly
      mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect
      in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in
      getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made
      him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no
      security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done,
      we rose to our feet breathless and panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have his cab,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;It will serve to take him to
      Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, with a pleasant smile,
      &ldquo;we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to
      put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I
      will refuse to answer them.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an
      arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier
      against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska,
      and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the
      south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one
      mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty
      mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers
      which dash through jagged cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in
      winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali
      dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of
      barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of
      Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other
      hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of
      those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their
      prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily
      through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark
      ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These
      are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.

      In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the
      northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches
      the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and
      intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme
      verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged
      summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no
      sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in
      the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth&mdash;above
      all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a
      sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence&mdash;complete
      and heart-subduing silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad
      plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees
      a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in
      the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the
      feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects
      which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of
      alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse,
      others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and
      the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly
      caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the
      wayside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,
      eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was
      such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An
      observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to
      forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown
      parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long,
      brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were
      sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand
      which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As
      he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure
      and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous
      constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so
      baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him
      that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying&mdash;dying from
      hunger and from thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation,
      in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain
      stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains,
      without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the
      presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of
      hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and
      then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there,
      on that barren crag, he was about to die. &ldquo;Why not here, as well as in a
      feather bed, twenty years hence,&rdquo; he muttered, as he seated himself in the
      shelter of a boulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,
      and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried
      slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for
      his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some
      little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little
      moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very
      bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt me!&rdquo; said a childish voice reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I though,&rdquo; the man answered penitently, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go for to do it.&rdquo;
       As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little
      girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock
      with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother&rsquo;s care. The child was
      pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered
      less than her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it now?&rdquo; he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the
      towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss it and make it well,&rdquo; she said, with perfect gravity, shoving <a
      href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19"><small>19</small></a>
      the injured part up to him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what mother used to do. Where&rsquo;s
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s gone. I guess you&rsquo;ll see her before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone, eh!&rdquo; said the little girl. &ldquo;Funny, she didn&rsquo;t say good-bye; she
      &lsquo;most always did if she was just goin&rsquo; over to Auntie&rsquo;s for tea, and now
      she&rsquo;s been away three days. Say, it&rsquo;s awful dry, ain&rsquo;t it? Ain&rsquo;t there no
      water, nor nothing to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there ain&rsquo;t nothing, dearie. You&rsquo;ll just need to be patient awhile,
      and then you&rsquo;ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then
      you&rsquo;ll feel bullier. It ain&rsquo;t easy to talk when your lips is like leather,
      but I guess I&rsquo;d best let you know how the cards lie. What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve
      got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty things! fine things!&rdquo; cried the little girl enthusiastically,
      holding up two glittering fragments of mica. &ldquo;When we goes back to home
      I&rsquo;ll give them to brother Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see prettier things than them soon,&rdquo; said the man confidently.
      &ldquo;You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though&mdash;you remember
      when we left the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we reckoned we&rsquo;d strike another river soon, d&rsquo;ye see. But there was
      somethin&rsquo; wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin&rsquo;, and it didn&rsquo;t turn up.
      Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you couldn&rsquo;t wash yourself,&rdquo; interrupted his companion gravely,
      staring up at his grimy visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian
      Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,
      your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then mother&rsquo;s a deader too,&rdquo; cried the little girl dropping her face in
      her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some
      chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we
      tramped it together. It don&rsquo;t seem as though we&rsquo;ve improved matters.
      There&rsquo;s an almighty small chance for us now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that we are going to die too?&rdquo; asked the child, checking her
      sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s about the size of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so before?&rdquo; she said, laughing gleefully. &ldquo;You gave me
      such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we&rsquo;ll be with mother
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will, dearie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you too. I&rsquo;ll tell her how awful good you&rsquo;ve been. I&rsquo;ll bet she meets
      us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of
      buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond
      of. How long will it be first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;not very long.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon the
      northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three
      little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they
      approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds,
      which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon
      some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the
      west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cocks and hens,&rdquo; cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their
      ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. &ldquo;Say, did God
      make this country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In course He did,&rdquo; said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,&rdquo; the
      little girl continued. &ldquo;I guess somebody else made the country in these
      parts. It&rsquo;s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would ye think of offering up prayer?&rdquo; the man asked diffidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t night yet,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter. It ain&rsquo;t quite regular, but He won&rsquo;t mind that, you bet.
      You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when
      we was on the Plains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say some yourself?&rdquo; the child asked, with wondering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disremember them,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t said none since I was half
      the height o&rsquo; that gun. I guess it&rsquo;s never too late. You say them out, and
      I&rsquo;ll stand by and come in on the choruses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll need to kneel down, and me too,&rdquo; she said, laying the shawl
      out for that purpose. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to put your hands up like this. It makes
      you feel kind o&rsquo; good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it.
      Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little
      prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,
      and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless
      heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face
      to face, while the two voices&mdash;the one thin and clear, the other deep
      and harsh&mdash;united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The
      prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder
      until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her
      protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to
      be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed
      himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired
      eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man&rsquo;s
      grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both
      slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight
      would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain
      there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to
      be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing
      higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud
      continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only
      be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots
      the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great
      herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him.
      This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust
      drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were
      reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed
      horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed
      itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a
      caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the
      rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain
      stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and
      men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and
      children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white
      coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather
      some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to
      seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused
      clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the
      creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not
      sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced
      men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching
      the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wells are to the right, my brothers,&rdquo; said one, a hard-lipped,
      clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the right of the Sierra Blanco&mdash;so we shall reach the Rio
      Grande,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not for water,&rdquo; cried a third. &ldquo;He who could draw it from the rocks
      will not now abandon His own chosen people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen! Amen!&rdquo; responded the whole party.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and
      keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag
      above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing
      up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a
      general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen
      came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word &lsquo;Redskins&rsquo; was on
      every lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any number of Injuns here,&rdquo; said the elderly man who
      appeared to be in command. &ldquo;We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no
      other tribes until we cross the great mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,&rdquo; asked one of the band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; &ldquo;and I,&rdquo; cried a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave your horses below and we will await you here,&rdquo; the Elder answered.
      In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and
      were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had
      excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the
      confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain
      below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out
      against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was
      leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though
      overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the
      same way by the sight which met their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single
      giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded
      and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and
      regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little
      child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her
      golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her
      rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth
      within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump
      little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining
      buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her
      companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood
      three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous
      screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about <a
      href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20" id="linknoteref-20"><small>20</small></a>
      them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon
      the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and
      which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His
      face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his
      boney hand over his eyes. &ldquo;This is what they call delirium, I guess,&rdquo; he
      muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat,
      and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning
      gaze of childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that
      their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and
      hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt
      companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is John Ferrier,&rdquo; the wanderer explained; &ldquo;me and that little un
      are all that&rsquo;s left o&rsquo; twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o&rsquo; thirst
      and hunger away down in the south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she your child?&rdquo; asked someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she is now,&rdquo; the other cried, defiantly; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s mine &lsquo;cause I
      saved her. No man will take her from me. She&rsquo;s Lucy Ferrier from this day
      on. Who are you, though?&rdquo; he continued, glancing with curiosity at his
      stalwart, sunburned rescuers; &ldquo;there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nigh upon ten thousand,&rdquo; said one of the young men; &ldquo;we are the
      persecuted children of God&mdash;the chosen of the Angel Merona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard tell on him,&rdquo; said the wanderer. &ldquo;He appears to have chosen
      a fair crowd of ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not jest at that which is sacred,&rdquo; said the other sternly. &ldquo;We are of
      those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on
      plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at
      Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had
      founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and
      from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. &ldquo;I
      see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are the Mormons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are the Mormons,&rdquo; answered his companions with one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our
      Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by
      crowds of the pilgrims&mdash;pale-faced meek-looking women, strong
      laughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of
      astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they
      perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the
      other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a
      great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous
      for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance.
      Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two,
      or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not
      have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and
      resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brown-backed
      volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened
      attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two
      castaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we take you with us,&rdquo; he said, in solemn words, &ldquo;it can only be as
      believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better
      far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should
      prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole
      fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll come with you on any terms,&rdquo; said Ferrier, with such emphasis
      that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone
      retained his stern, impressive expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him, Brother Stangerson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give him food and drink, and the
      child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We
      have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On, on to Zion!&rdquo; cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down
      the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a
      dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking
      of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan
      was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had
      been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall remain here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In a few days you will have recovered
      from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you
      are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the
      voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH.
    </h2>

      THIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by
      the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the
      shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains
      they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The
      savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease&mdash;every
      impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with
      Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had
      shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did
      not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley
      of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of
      their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres
      were to be theirs for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a
      resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future
      city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in
      proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to
      his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares
      sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging,
      planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden
      with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above
      all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city
      grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the
      closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw
      was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who
      had led them safe through many dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his
      fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to
      the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along
      pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson&rsquo;s waggon, a retreat which she shared
      with the Mormon&rsquo;s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy
      of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the
      shock caused by her mother&rsquo;s death, she soon became a pet with the women,
      and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home.
      In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations,
      distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So
      rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they
      reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he
      should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of
      the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson,
      Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial
      log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it
      grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in
      his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him
      to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it
      came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered
      exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six
      he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half
      a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him.
      From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no
      name better known than that of John Ferrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities
      of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to
      set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never
      gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by
      resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some
      who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who
      put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,
      again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had
      pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier
      remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the
      religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox
      and straight-walking man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father
      in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic
      odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young
      girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek
      more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road
      which ran by Ferrier&rsquo;s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their
      mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the
      wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father&rsquo;s mustang, and managing it
      with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud
      blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of
      the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be
      found in the whole Pacific slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had
      developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious
      change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all
      does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of
      a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture
      of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within
      her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little
      incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy
      Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future
      influence on her destiny and that of many besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the
      bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in
      the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads
      defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for
      the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay
      through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and
      bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired
      immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey.
      Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an
      accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed
      with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She
      had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she
      had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking
      only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained
      adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional
      Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed
      stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked
      by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen
      from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle
      by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got
      fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she
      found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed,
      long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was
      not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to
      urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade.
      Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or
      design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited
      it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort
      of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but
      a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the
      excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh
      madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle,
      yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and
      terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to
      swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of
      dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have
      abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow
      which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand
      caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the
      drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt, I hope, miss,&rdquo; said her preserver, respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful
      frightened,&rdquo; she said, naively; &ldquo;whoever would have thought that Poncho
      would have been so scared by a lot of cows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God you kept your seat,&rdquo; the other said earnestly. He was a tall,
      savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in
      the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders.
      &ldquo;I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I saw you
      ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the
      Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he&rsquo;s the same Ferrier, my father and he
      were pretty thick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better come and ask yourself?&rdquo; she asked, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes
      sparkled with pleasure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been in the
      mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting
      condition. He must take us as he finds us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he&rsquo;d have never got over
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither would I,&rdquo; said her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Well, I don&rsquo;t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You
      ain&rsquo;t even a friend of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young hunter&rsquo;s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy
      Ferrier laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;of course, you are a friend now.
      You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won&rsquo;t trust me
      with his business any more. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her
      little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her
      riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He
      and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and
      were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to
      work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of
      them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts
      into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and
      wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart
      to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that
      a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor
      any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new
      and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not
      the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion
      of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to
      succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not
      fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him
      successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face
      was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and
      absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the
      outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was
      able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her
      father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a
      strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon
      days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a
      ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had
      been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old
      farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was
      silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too
      clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may
      not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away
      upon the man who had won her affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up
      at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw
      the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am off, Lucy,&rdquo; he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing
      tenderly down into her face; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you to come with me now, but
      will you be ready to come when I am here again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when will that be?&rdquo; she asked, blushing and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my
      darling. There&rsquo;s no one who can stand between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about father?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right.
      I have no fear on that head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there&rsquo;s no
      more to be said,&rdquo; she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. &ldquo;It is settled,
      then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for
      me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling&mdash;good-bye. In two months
      you shall see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his
      horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid
      that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was
      leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from
      her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all
      Utah.

      CHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed
      from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier&rsquo;s heart was sore within him when he
      thought of the young man&rsquo;s return, and of the impending loss of his
      adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the
      arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always
      determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever
      induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he
      regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he
      might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was
      inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to
      express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the
      Land of the Saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, a dangerous matter&mdash;so dangerous that even the most saintly
      dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest
      something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down
      a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned
      persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible
      description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehm-gericht,
      nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable
      machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this
      organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent,
      and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the
      Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had
      befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father
      ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret
      judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet
      none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was
      suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling,
      and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the
      doubts which oppressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the
      recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to
      pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply
      of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population
      on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be
      bandied about&mdash;rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in
      regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the
      harems of the Elders&mdash;women who pined and wept, and bore upon their
      faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the
      mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless,
      who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and rumours took
      substance and shape, and were corroborated and re-corroborated, until they
      resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely
      ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels,
      is a sinister and an ill-omened one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results
      served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in
      the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The
      names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under
      the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom
      you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might
      be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact
      a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none
      spoke of the things which were nearest his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,
      when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw
      a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart
      leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young
      himself. Full of trepidation&mdash;for he knew that such a visit boded him
      little good&mdash;Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The
      latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a
      stern face into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Ferrier,&rdquo; he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly
      from under his light-coloured eyelashes, &ldquo;the true believers have been
      good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the
      desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,
      gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our
      protection. Is not this so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; answered John Ferrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you
      should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.
      This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have
      neglected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how have I neglected it?&rdquo; asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in
      expostulation. &ldquo;Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended
      at the Temple? Have I not&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your wives?&rdquo; asked Young, looking round him. &ldquo;Call them in,
      that I may greet them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that I have not married,&rdquo; Ferrier answered. &ldquo;But women were
      few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely
      man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,&rdquo; said the leader of the
      Mormons. &ldquo;She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in
      the eyes of many who are high in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ferrier groaned internally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve&mdash;stories that
      she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.
      What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? &lsquo;Let
      every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a
      Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.&rsquo; This being so, it is impossible that
      you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested&mdash;so it has been
      decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not
      have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We
      Elders have many heifers, <a href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29"
       id="linknoteref-29"><small>29</small></a> but our children must also be
      provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them
      would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between
      them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give us time,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;My daughter is very young&mdash;she
      is scarce of an age to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall have a month to choose,&rdquo; said Young, rising from his seat. &ldquo;At
      the end of that time she shall give her answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and
      flashing eyes. &ldquo;It were better for you, John Ferrier,&rdquo; he thundered, &ldquo;that
      you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than
      that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and
      Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he
      should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon
      his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her
      pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help it,&rdquo; she said, in answer to his look. &ldquo;His voice rang
      through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you scare yourself,&rdquo; he answered, drawing her to him, and passing
      his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix it up
      somehow or another. You don&rsquo;t find your fancy kind o&rsquo; lessening for this
      chap, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; of course not. I shouldn&rsquo;t care to hear you say you did. He&rsquo;s a
      likely lad, and he&rsquo;s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in
      spite o&rsquo; all their praying and preaching. There&rsquo;s a party starting for
      Nevada to-morrow, and I&rsquo;ll manage to send him a message letting him know
      the hole we are in. If I know anything o&rsquo; that young man, he&rsquo;ll be back
      here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy laughed through her tears at her father&rsquo;s description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I
      am frightened, dear. One hears&mdash;one hears such dreadful stories about
      those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t opposed him yet,&rdquo; her father answered. &ldquo;It will be time to
      look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the
      end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Utah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell
      the truth, Lucy, it isn&rsquo;t the first time I have thought of doing it. I
      don&rsquo;t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their
      darned prophet. I&rsquo;m a free-born American, and it&rsquo;s all new to me. Guess
      I&rsquo;m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might
      chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite
      direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t let us leave,&rdquo; his daughter objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till Jefferson comes, and we&rsquo;ll soon manage that. In the meantime,
      don&rsquo;t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don&rsquo;t get your eyes swelled up,
      else he&rsquo;ll be walking into me when he sees you. There&rsquo;s nothing to be
      afeared about, and there&rsquo;s no danger at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but
      she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of
      the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty
      old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John
      Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who
      was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to
      Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which
      threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having
      done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each
      of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find
      two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale
      face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon
      the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features,
      was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket,
      whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered,
      and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you don&rsquo;t know us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This here is the son of Elder
      Drebber, and I&rsquo;m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert
      when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As He will all the nations in His own good time,&rdquo; said the other in a
      nasal voice; &ldquo;He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come,&rdquo; continued Stangerson, &ldquo;at the advice of our fathers to
      solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you
      and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven,
      it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,&rdquo; cried the other; &ldquo;the question is not how
      many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over
      his mills to me, and I am the richer man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my prospects are better,&rdquo; said the other, warmly. &ldquo;When the Lord
      removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory.
      Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be for the maiden to decide,&rdquo; rejoined young Drebber, smirking at
      his own reflection in the glass. &ldquo;We will leave it all to her decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly
      able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said at last, striding up to them, &ldquo;when my daughter
      summons you, you can come, but until then I don&rsquo;t want to see your faces
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this
      competition between them for the maiden&rsquo;s hand was the highest of honours
      both to her and her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two ways out of the room,&rdquo; cried Ferrier; &ldquo;there is the door,
      and there is the window. Which do you care to use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that
      his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old
      farmer followed them to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,&rdquo; he said,
      sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall smart for this!&rdquo; Stangerson cried, white with rage. &ldquo;You have
      defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of
      your days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,&rdquo; cried young Drebber; &ldquo;He
      will arise and smite you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll start the smiting,&rdquo; exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have
      rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and
      restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses&rsquo; 
      hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young canting rascals!&rdquo; he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from
      his forehead; &ldquo;I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the
      wife of either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so should I, father,&rdquo; she answered, with spirit; &ldquo;but Jefferson will
      soon be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we
      do not know what their next move may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help
      should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter.
      In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of
      rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were
      punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier
      knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as
      well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and
      their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled
      at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he
      could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed
      his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the
      whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he
      was ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young
      as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an
      unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a
      small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his
      chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this
      warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants
      slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He
      crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident
      struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the
      balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage
      could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand
      which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could
      never have known who had slain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their
      breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre
      of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number
      28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her.
      That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he
      heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the
      outside of his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his
      unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some
      conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month
      of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes
      upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the
      garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not
      discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost
      superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and
      restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He
      had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young
      hunter from Nevada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of
      the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came
      no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver
      shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help
      had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that
      again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape.
      Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which
      surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The
      more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could
      pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he
      would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet
      the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself
      before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter&rsquo;s dishonour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and
      searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the
      figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of
      the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and
      terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter&mdash;what was
      to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible
      network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table
      and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound&mdash;low,
      but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the
      house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a
      pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated.
      Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the
      door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the
      murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was
      marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that
      instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and
      chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were
      twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the
      farmer&rsquo;s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the
      road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked
      to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own
      feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the
      ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with
      his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first
      thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying
      man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the
      hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the
      house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the
      astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson
      Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; gasped John Ferrier. &ldquo;How you scared me! Whatever made you
      come in like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me food,&rdquo; the other said, hoarsely. &ldquo;I have had no time for bite or
      sup for eight-and-forty hours.&rdquo; He flung himself upon the <a
      href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21" id="linknoteref-21"><small>21</small></a>
      cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host&rsquo;s
      supper, and devoured it voraciously. &ldquo;Does Lucy bear up well?&rdquo; he asked,
      when he had satisfied his hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She does not know the danger,&rdquo; her father answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled
      my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they&rsquo;re not quite sharp
      enough to catch a Washoe hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a
      devoted ally. He seized the young man&rsquo;s leathery hand and wrung it
      cordially. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a man to be proud of,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are not many who
      would come to share our danger and our troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it there, pard,&rdquo; the young hunter answered. &ldquo;I have a respect
      for you, but if you were alone in this business I&rsquo;d think twice before I
      put my head into such a hornet&rsquo;s nest. It&rsquo;s Lucy that brings me here, and
      before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o&rsquo; the Hope family
      in Utah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I
      have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money
      have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson
      City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the
      servants do not sleep in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching
      journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a
      small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by
      experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly
      completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter
      all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was
      warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make our start at once,&rdquo; said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low
      but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but
      has steeled his heart to meet it. &ldquo;The front and back entrances are
      watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and
      across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine
      where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through
      the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if we are stopped,&rdquo; asked Ferrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his
      tunic. &ldquo;If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them
      with us,&rdquo; he said with a sinister smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the
      darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and
      which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to
      the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his
      daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so
      peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of
      grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder
      lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young
      hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to
      satisfy him upon that head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty
      provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of
      her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully,
      they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then
      one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and
      crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the
      hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the
      cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his
      two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay
      silent and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears
      of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the
      melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them,
      which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the
      same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had
      been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second
      man appeared out of the obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow at midnight,&rdquo; said the first who appeared to be in authority.
      &ldquo;When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;Shall I tell Brother Drebber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven to five!&rdquo; repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in
      different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form
      of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in
      the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his
      companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of
      his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength
      appeared to fail her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry on! hurry on!&rdquo; he gasped from time to time. &ldquo;We are through the
      line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet
      anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid
      recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a
      rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged
      peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led
      between them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting them.
      With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great
      boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the
      retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been
      picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of
      the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along
      the precipitous and dangerous path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face
      Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a
      thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic
      columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.
      On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance
      impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places
      that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised
      riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and
      difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for
      every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism
      from which they were flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the
      jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most
      desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and
      pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark
      and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as
      soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of &ldquo;Who goes
      there?&rdquo; rang through the silent ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Travellers for Nevada,&rdquo; said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle
      which hung by his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at
      them as if dissatisfied at their reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whose permission?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Holy Four,&rdquo; answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him
      that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine from seven,&rdquo; cried the sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven from five,&rdquo; returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the
      countersign which he had heard in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass, and the Lord go with you,&rdquo; said the voice from above. Beyond his
      post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a
      trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his
      gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people,
      and that freedom lay before them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      ALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular
      and rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope&rsquo;s
      intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once
      more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay
      before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them
      in, peeping over each other&rsquo;s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were
      the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed
      to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come
      hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the
      barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen
      in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering
      down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and
      startled the weary horses into a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great
      mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they
      were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts
      of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which
      swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while
      they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have
      rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. &ldquo;They will be upon our
      track by this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everything depends upon our speed. Once
      safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by
      evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their
      enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the
      rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled
      together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours&rsquo; sleep. Before daybreak,
      however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs
      of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly
      out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had
      incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon
      it was to close upon them and crush them.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of
      provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,
      however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had
      frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.
      Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made
      a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they
      were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was
      bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw
      his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might
      throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl
      crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless
      in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without
      success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other
      indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At
      last, after two or three hours&rsquo; fruitless search, he was thinking of
      turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight
      which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a
      jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a
      creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair
      of gigantic horns. The big-horn&mdash;for so it is called&mdash;was
      acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the
      hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had
      not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and
      took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang
      into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and
      then came crashing down into the valley beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself
      with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over
      his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was
      already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the
      difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the
      ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the
      path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and
      sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was
      impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile
      or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had
      never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried
      another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was
      almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar
      to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for
      the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the
      obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his
      exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that
      every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough
      to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them.
      Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which
      bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had
      been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his
      hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal
      that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save
      his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne
      back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder
      than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had
      left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he
      hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the
      fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but
      it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead
      silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to
      convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains
      of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear
      that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence&mdash;a
      disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin
      round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was
      essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his
      temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the
      smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to
      examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of
      horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the
      fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had
      afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of
      his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that
      they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every
      nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp
      was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there
      before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As
      the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted
      on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The
      inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        JOHN FERRIER,
                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, <a href="#linknote-22"
       name="linknoteref-22" id="linknoteref-22">22</a>
                    Died August 4th, 1860.
</pre>
    <p>
      The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,
      then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to
      see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had
      been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original
      destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder&rsquo;s son. As the young
      fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to
      prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his
      last silent resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs
      from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least
      devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,
      Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which
      he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he
      stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could
      assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by
      his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should,
      he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he
      retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up
      the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he
      made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back
      through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he
      had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among
      the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was
      always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Cañon, from
      which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down
      upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle
      and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath
      him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the
      principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating
      as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and
      saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him
      as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different
      times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of
      finding out what Lucy Ferrier&rsquo;s fate had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Jefferson Hope,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You remember me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment&mdash;indeed, it
      was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with
      ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of
      former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his
      identity, the man&rsquo;s surprise changed to consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad to come here,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is as much as my own life is
      worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the
      Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear them, or their warrant,&rdquo; Hope said, earnestly. &ldquo;You must
      know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you
      hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For
      God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t refuse to answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the Mormon asked uneasily. &ldquo;Be quick. The very rocks have
      ears and the trees eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of Lucy Ferrier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you
      have no life left in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had
      sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. &ldquo;Married, you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married yesterday&mdash;that&rsquo;s what those flags are for on the Endowment
      House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as
      to which was to have her. They&rsquo;d both been in the party that followed
      them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the
      best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber&rsquo;s party was
      the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won&rsquo;t have her
      very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like
      a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am off,&rdquo; said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His
      face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its
      expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,
      strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to
      the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce
      and so dangerous as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was
      the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage
      into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again,
      but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had
      married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier&rsquo;s property, did not
      affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned
      over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the
      Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the
      morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was
      flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments
      strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he
      walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure
      soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to
      her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the
      wedding-ring from her finger. &ldquo;She shall not be buried in that,&rdquo; he cried
      with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the
      stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the
      watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade
      other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the
      circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a
      strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for
      vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird
      figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the
      lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson&rsquo;s window
      and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another
      occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on
      him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his
      face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of
      these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the
      mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always
      without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone
      or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they
      were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of
      their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter&rsquo;s mind
      was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had
      taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other
      emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized
      that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which
      he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing
      him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of
      his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he
      persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy&rsquo;s game, so he
      reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health
      and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without
      privation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination
      of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly
      five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his
      craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he
      had stood by John Ferrier&rsquo;s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name,
      he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as
      long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil
      tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a
      few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having
      rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the
      secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and
      become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one
      knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to
      convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed
      a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor.
      There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of
      revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never
      faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by
      such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town
      through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year,
      his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human
      bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had
      devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a
      glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland
      in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his
      miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced,
      however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant
      in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a
      justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his
      private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of
      their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening
      Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find
      sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it
      was only to find that Drebber&rsquo;s house was deserted, and that he and his
      secretary had departed for Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged
      him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some
      time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching
      journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed
      for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in
      any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached
      St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them
      there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish
      capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London,
      where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred
      there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter&rsquo;s own account, as
      duly recorded in Dr. Watson&rsquo;s Journal, to which we are already under such
      obligations.

      CHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.
    </h2>
    <p>
      OUR prisoner&rsquo;s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity
      in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he
      smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt
      any of us in the scuffle. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re going to take me to the
      police-station,&rdquo; he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;My cab&rsquo;s at the door. If
      you&rsquo;ll loose my legs I&rsquo;ll walk down to it. I&rsquo;m not so light to lift as I
      used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition
      rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and
      loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles. <a
      href="#linknote-23" name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23"><small>23</small></a>
      He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were
      free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I
      had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face
      bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as
      his personal strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the
      man for it,&rdquo; he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my
      fellow-lodger. &ldquo;The way you kept on my trail was a caution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better come with me,&rdquo; said Holmes to the two detectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can drive you,&rdquo; said Lestrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have
      taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no
      attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and
      we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and
      brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a
      small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner&rsquo;s name and
      the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official
      was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull
      mechanical way. &ldquo;The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the
      course of the week,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have
      you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be
      taken down, and may be used against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good deal to say,&rdquo; our prisoner said slowly. &ldquo;I want to tell
      you gentlemen all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better reserve that for your trial?&rdquo; asked the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may never be tried,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look startled. It isn&rsquo;t
      suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?&rdquo; He turned his fierce dark
      eyes upon me as he asked this last question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then put your hand here,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, motioning with his
      manacled wrists towards his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and
      commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to
      thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful
      engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming
      and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you have an aortic aneurism!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call it,&rdquo; he said, placidly. &ldquo;I went to a Doctor last
      week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days
      passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure
      and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I&rsquo;ve done my work now,
      and I don&rsquo;t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of
      the business behind me. I don&rsquo;t want to be remembered as a common
      cut-throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the
      advisability of allowing him to tell his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?&rdquo; the former
      asked, <a href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24" id="linknoteref-24"><small>24</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly there is,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take
      his statement,&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;You are at liberty, sir, to give your
      account, which I again warn you will be taken down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit down, with your leave,&rdquo; the prisoner said, suiting the action to
      the word. &ldquo;This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we
      had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I&rsquo;m on the brink of the
      grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute
      truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the
      following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner,
      as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can
      vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to
      Lestrade&rsquo;s note-book, in which the prisoner&rsquo;s words were taken down
      exactly as they were uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t much matter to you why I hated these men,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s enough
      that they were guilty of the death of two human beings&mdash;a father and
      a daughter&mdash;and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.
      After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was
      impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew
      of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and
      executioner all rolled into one. You&rsquo;d have done the same, if you have any
      manhood in you, if you had been in my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She
      was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I
      took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying
      eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be
      of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me,
      and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I
      caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I
      die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this
      world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is
      nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to
      follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found
      that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding
      are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner&rsquo;s office, and
      soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and
      whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much
      over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn
      my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived,
      this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when
      once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living;
      but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were
      at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river.
      When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown
      my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog
      them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that
      they should not escape me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
      London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab,
      and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could
      not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night
      that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my
      employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand
      upon the men I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was
      some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,
      and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day,
      and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time,
      but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and
      early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for
      something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that
      this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work
      undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the
      street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to
      their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time
      Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse
      and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that
      they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out,
      and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I
      heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had
      just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed
      to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I
      got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that
      passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own
      to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him.
      His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had
      resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a
      delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson
      said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he
      was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to
      dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply
      bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him
      at Halliday&rsquo;s Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be
      back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my
      enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but
      singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue
      precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in
      vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes
      him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by
      which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me
      understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days
      before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the
      Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was
      claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a
      moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had
      access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon
      being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the
      difficult problem which I had now to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying
      for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered
      in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in
      front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my
      horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across
      Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment,
      we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could
      not imagine what his intention was in returning there; but I went on and
      pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and
      his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth
      gets dry with the talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or
      more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the
      house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of
      whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen
      before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the
      head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half
      across the road. &lsquo;You hound,&rsquo; he cried, shaking his stick at him; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      teach you to insult an honest girl!&rsquo; He was so hot that I think he would
      have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away
      down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the
      corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. &lsquo;Drive me to
      Halliday&rsquo;s Private Hotel,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I
      feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along
      slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him
      right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last
      interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the
      problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered
      me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should
      wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out
      he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only
      have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to
      do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he
      chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled
      in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of
      the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on
      poisions, <a href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
      and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had
      extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful
      that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which
      this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to
      a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid
      into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar
      pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my
      chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes,
      while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a
      good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I
      had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I
      was to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and
      raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within&mdash;so
      glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you
      gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty
      long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would
      understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my
      nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with
      excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy
      looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I
      see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each
      side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the
      dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all
      huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time to
      get out,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All right, cabby,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for
      he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to
      walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy.
      When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I
      give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were
      walking in front of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s infernally dark,&rsquo; said he, stamping about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll soon have a light,&rsquo; I said, striking a match and putting it to a
      wax candle which I had brought with me. &lsquo;Now, Enoch Drebber,&rsquo; I continued,
      turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, &lsquo;who am I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a
      horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me
      that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the
      perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his
      head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and
      long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never
      hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You dog!&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.
      Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings
      have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow&rsquo;s sun
      rise.&rsquo; He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his
      face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my
      temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of
      some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?&rsquo; I cried, locking the door, and
      shaking the key in his face. &lsquo;Punishment has been slow in coming, but it
      has overtaken you at last.&rsquo; I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He
      would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you murder me?&rsquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There is no murder,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What
      mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her
      slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless
      harem.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was not I who killed her father,&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But it was you who broke her innocent heart,&rsquo; I shrieked, thrusting the
      box before him. &lsquo;Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There
      is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us
      see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my
      knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed
      the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or
      more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever
      forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told
      him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held
      Lucy&rsquo;s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for
      the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his
      features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then,
      with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my
      foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was
      dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of
      it. I don&rsquo;t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the
      wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police
      upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a
      German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was
      argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have
      done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the
      Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a
      convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that
      there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had
      driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually
      kept Lucy&rsquo;s ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at
      this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I might
      have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber&rsquo;s body, I drove back, and
      leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house&mdash;for I
      was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived
      there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming
      out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be
      hopelessly drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to
      do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier&rsquo;s debt. I knew that
      he was staying at Halliday&rsquo;s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but
      he never came out. <a href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26"
       id="linknoteref-26"><small>26</small></a> fancy that he suspected
      something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was
      Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by
      staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the
      window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some
      ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way
      into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the
      hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long
      before. I described Drebber&rsquo;s death to him, and I gave him the same choice
      of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which
      that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In
      self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in
      any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick
      out anything but the poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little more to say, and it&rsquo;s as well, for I am about done up. I
      went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could
      save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a
      ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope,
      and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I
      went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man
      here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled <a
      href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27"><small>27</small></a>
      as ever I saw in my life. That&rsquo;s the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may
      consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer
      of justice as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So thrilling had the man&rsquo;s narrative been, and his manner was so
      impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional
      detectives, <i>blasé</i> as they were in every detail of crime, appeared
      to be keenly interested in the man&rsquo;s story. When he finished we sat for
      some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of
      Lestrade&rsquo;s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one point on which I should like a little more
      information,&rdquo; Sherlock Holmes said at last. &ldquo;Who was your accomplice who
      came for the ring which I advertised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. &ldquo;I can tell my own secrets,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t get other people into trouble. I saw your
      advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring
      which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you&rsquo;ll own he
      did it smartly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt of that,&rdquo; said Holmes heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; the Inspector remarked gravely, &ldquo;the forms of the law
      must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the
      magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be
      responsible for him.&rdquo; He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was
      led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of
      the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday;
      but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. A
      higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been
      summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him.
      On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found
      in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile
      upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look
      back upon a useful life, and on work well done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,&rdquo; Holmes remarked, as
      we chatted it over next evening. &ldquo;Where will their grand advertisement be
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that they had very much to do with his capture,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,&rdquo; returned my
      companion, bitterly. &ldquo;The question is, what can you make people believe
      that you have done. Never mind,&rdquo; he continued, more brightly, after a
      pause. &ldquo;I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has
      been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were
      several most instructive points about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple!&rdquo; I ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,&rdquo; said Sherlock
      Holmes, smiling at my surprise. &ldquo;The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is,
      that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to
      lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually
      a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the
      grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful
      accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much.
      In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and
      so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason
      synthetically for one who can reason analytically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I do not quite follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.
      Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what
      the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds,
      and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few
      people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve
      from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to
      that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards,
      or analytically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find
      everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the
      different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached
      the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all
      impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I
      have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I
      ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied
      myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of
      the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a
      gentleman&rsquo;s brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden
      path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable
      for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled
      line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a
      meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and
      so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always
      laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to
      me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track
      of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to
      tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks
      had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them.
      In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal
      visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I
      calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably
      dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted
      man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder
      there was. There was no wound upon the dead man&rsquo;s person, but the agitated
      expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before
      it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural
      cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having
      sniffed the dead man&rsquo;s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came
      to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued
      that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon
      his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no
      other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very
      unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a
      new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of
      Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not
      been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,
      then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was
      inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are
      only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the
      contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his
      tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It
      must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for
      such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the
      wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too
      evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the
      question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some
      dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he
      had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in
      Mr. Drebber&rsquo;s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which
      confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer&rsquo;s height, and furnished me
      with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of
      his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs
      of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the
      murderer&rsquo;s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of
      blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man,
      unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so
      I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and
      ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I
      telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to
      the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer
      was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the
      protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope,
      and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held
      the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure
      the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into
      the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the
      cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a
      way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of
      it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house?
      Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a
      deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who
      was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another
      through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver.
      All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that
      Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to
      be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be
      likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at
      least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that
      he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a
      country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my
      Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab
      proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How
      well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still
      fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which
      was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been
      prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills,
      the existence of which I had already surmised. You see the whole thing is
      a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Your merits should be publicly recognized.
      You should publish an account of the case. If you won&rsquo;t, I will for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do what you like, Doctor,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; he continued,
      handing a paper over to me, &ldquo;look at this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the <i>Echo</i> for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed
      was devoted to the case in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The public,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;have lost a sensational treat through the sudden
      death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch
      Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will
      probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority
      that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in
      which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims
      belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the
      deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no
      other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the
      efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to
      all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and
      not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit
      of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard
      officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it
      appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself,
      as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such
      instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It
      is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two
      officers as a fitting recognition of their services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so when we started?&rdquo; cried Sherlock Holmes with a
      laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a
      testimonial!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I have all the facts in my journal, and the
      public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented
      by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser&mdash;

Produced by Roger Squires, and David Widger

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
