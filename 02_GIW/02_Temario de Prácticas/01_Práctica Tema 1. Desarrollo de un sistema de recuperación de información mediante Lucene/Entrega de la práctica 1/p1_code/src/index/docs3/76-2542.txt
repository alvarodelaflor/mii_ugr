At the back, a door to the right leads to the\r\nentrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer\xe2\x80\x99s study. Between the\r\ndoors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,\r\nand beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs\r\nand a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another\r\ndoor; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy\r\nchairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small\r\ntable. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small\r\nobjects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are\r\ncarpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter._\r\n\r\n_A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to\r\nopen. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor\r\ndress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to\r\nthe right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is\r\nseen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he\r\ngives to the MAID who has opened the door.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not\r\nsee it until this evening, when it is dressed. _[To the PORTER, taking\r\nout her purse.]_ How much?\r\n\r\nPORTER.\r\nSixpence.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThere is a shilling. No, keep the change. _[The PORTER thanks her, and\r\ngoes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes\r\noff her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket\r\nand eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s door and\r\nlistens.]_ Yes, he is in. _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the\r\nright.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIs it my little squirrel bustling about?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhen did my squirrel come home?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nJust now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her\r\nmouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t disturb me. _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into\r\nthe room, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my\r\nlittle spendthrift been wasting money again?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.\r\nThis is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nStill, you know, we can\xe2\x80\x99t spend money recklessly.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t we? Just a\r\ntiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the\r\nsalary is due.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPooh! we can borrow until then.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora! _[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]_ The same\r\nlittle featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,\r\nand you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve\r\na slate fell on my head and killed me, and\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[putting her hands over his mouth]_. Oh! don\xe2\x80\x99t say such horrid things.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nStill, suppose that happened,\xe2\x80\x94what then?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIf that were to happen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I should care whether I owed\r\nmoney or not.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, but what about the people who had lent it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThey? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about\r\nthat. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a\r\nhome life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely\r\non the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the\r\nshort time longer that there need be any struggle.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[moving towards the stove]_. As you please, Torvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[following her]_. Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her\r\nwings. What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? _[Taking out\r\nhis purse.]_ Nora, what do you think I have got here?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[turning round quickly]_. Money!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThere you are. _[Gives her some money.]_ Do you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\na lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[counting]_. Ten shillings\xe2\x80\x94a pound\xe2\x80\x94two pounds! Thank you, thank you,\r\nTorvald; that will keep me going for a long time.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIndeed it must.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have\r\nbought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a\r\nsword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedstead for Emmy,\xe2\x80\x94they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break\r\nthem in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the\r\nmaids; old Anne ought really to have something better.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd what is in this parcel?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[crying out]_. No, no! you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t see that until this evening.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nVery well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what would\r\nyou like for yourself?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nFor myself? Oh, I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would\r\nparticularly like to have.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I really can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything\xe2\x80\x94unless, Torvald\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his]_.\r\nIf you really want to give me something, you might\xe2\x80\x94you might\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell, out with it!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[speaking quickly]_. You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as\r\nmuch as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut, Nora\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up in\r\nbeautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nbe fun?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat are little people called that are always wasting money?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSpendthrifts\xe2\x80\x94I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then I\r\nshall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very\r\nsensible plan, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[smiling]_. Indeed it is\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, if you were really to save\r\nout of the money I give you, and then really buy something for\r\nyourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of\r\nunnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh but, Torvald\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, my dear little Nora. _[Puts his arm round her\r\nwaist.]_ It\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of\r\nmoney. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[laughing]_. That\xe2\x80\x99s very true,\xe2\x80\x94all you can. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t save\r\nanything!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[smiling quietly and happily]_. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t any idea how many expenses\r\nwe skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some\r\nnew way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it,\r\nit seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone.\r\nStill, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it\r\nis true that you can inherit these things, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAh, I wish I had inherited many of papa\xe2\x80\x99s qualities.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet\r\nlittle skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking\r\nrather\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say\xe2\x80\x94rather uneasy today?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDo I?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou do, really. Look straight at me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[looks at him]_. Well?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[wagging his finger at her]_. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking\r\nrules in town today?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo; what makes you think that?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHasn\xe2\x80\x99t she paid a visit to the confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I assure you, Torvald\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNot been nibbling sweets?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, certainly not.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNot even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, Torvald, I assure you really\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThere, there, of course I was only joking.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[going to the table on the right]_. I should not think of going\r\nagainst your wishes.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNo, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word\xe2\x80\x94 _[Going up to\r\nher.]_ Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They\r\nwill all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDid you remember to invite Doctor Rank?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNo. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come to dinner\r\nwith us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning. I have\r\nordered some good wine. Nora, you can\xe2\x80\x99t think how I am looking forward\r\nto this evening.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSo am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIt is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment, and a\r\nbig enough income. It\xe2\x80\x99s delightful to think of, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDo you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks beforehand you\r\nshut yourself up every evening until long after midnight, making\r\nornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things that\r\nwere to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever\r\nspent!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t find it dull.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[smiling]_. But there was precious little result, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tease me about that again. How could I help the cat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing in and tearing everything to pieces?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOf course you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, poor little girl. You had the best of\r\nintentions to please us all, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the main thing. But it is a\r\ngood thing that our hard times are over.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, it is really wonderful.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThis time I needn\xe2\x80\x99t sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[clapping her hands]_. No, Torvald, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t any longer, need I! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderfully lovely to hear you say so! _[Taking his arm.]_ Now I will\r\ntell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.\r\nAs soon as Christmas is over\xe2\x80\x94_[A bell rings in the hall.]_ There\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbell. _[She tidies the room a little.]_ There\xe2\x80\x99s some one at the door.\r\nWhat a nuisance!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIf it is a caller, remember I am not at home.\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\n_[in the doorway]_. A lady to see you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x94a stranger.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAsk her to come in.\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\n_[to HELMER]_. The doctor came at the same time, sir.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDid he go straight into my room?\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\n_[HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers in Mrs Linde, who is in\r\ntravelling dress, and shuts the door.]_\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[in a dejected and timid voice]_. How do you do, Nora?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[doubtfully]_. How do you do\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t recognise me, I suppose.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94yes, to be sure, I seem to\xe2\x80\x94_[Suddenly.]_ Yes!\r\nChristine! Is it really you?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, it is I.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nChristine! To think of my not recognising you! And yet how could I\xe2\x80\x94_[In\r\na gentle voice.]_ How you have altered, Christine!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long years\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIs it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years have\r\nbeen a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come into\r\nthe town, and have taken this long journey in winter\xe2\x80\x94that was plucky of\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI arrived by steamer this morning.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTo have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful! We will\r\nhave such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold, I\r\nhope. _[Helps her.]_ Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy.\r\nNo, take this armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. _[Takes\r\nher hands.]_ Now you look like your old self again; it was only the\r\nfirst moment\xe2\x80\x94You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a little\r\nthinner.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd much, much older, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPerhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much. _[Stops\r\nsuddenly and speaks seriously.]_ What a thoughtless creature I am,\r\nchattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWhat do you mean, Nora?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[gently]_. Poor Christine, you are a widow.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes; it is three years ago now.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant\r\never so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and\r\nsomething always prevented me.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI quite understand, dear.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have\r\nsuffered. And he left you nothing?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd no children?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNothing at all, then.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNot even any sorrow or grief to live upon.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[looking incredulously at her]_. But, Christine, is that possible?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[smiles sadly and strokes her hair]_. It sometimes happens, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSo you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad that must be. I have three\r\nlovely children. You can\xe2\x80\x99t see them just now, for they are out with\r\ntheir nurse. But now you must tell me all about it.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, no; I want to hear about you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, you must begin. I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be selfish today; today I must only think\r\nof your affairs. But there is one thing I must tell you. Do you know we\r\nhave just had a great piece of good luck?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, what is it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nJust fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYour husband? What good luck!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, tremendous! A barrister\xe2\x80\x99s profession is such an uncertain thing,\r\nespecially if he won\xe2\x80\x99t undertake unsavoury cases; and naturally Torvald\r\nhas never been willing to do that, and I quite agree with him. You may\r\nimagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work in the Bank at\r\nthe New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of\r\ncommissions. For the future we can live quite differently\xe2\x80\x94we can do\r\njust as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy, Christine! It will be\r\nsplendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, anyhow I think it would be delightful to have what one needs.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, not only what one needs, but heaps and heaps of money.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[smiling]_. Nora, Nora, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you learned sense yet? In our\r\nschooldays you were a great spendthrift.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[laughing]_. Yes, that is what Torvald says now. _[Wags her finger at\r\nher.]_ But \xe2\x80\x9cNora, Nora\xe2\x80\x9d is not so silly as you think. We have not been\r\nin a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou too?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes; odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery, and that\r\nkind of thing. _[Dropping her voice.]_ And other things as well. You\r\nknow Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no\r\nprospect of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than\r\nbefore. But during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully.\r\nYou see, he had to make money every way he could, and he worked early\r\nand late; but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the\r\ndoctors said it was necessary for him to go south.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou spent a whole year in Italy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It was just\r\nafter Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a wonderfully\r\nbeautiful journey, and it saved Torvald\xe2\x80\x99s life. But it cost a\r\ntremendous lot of money, Christine.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nSo I should think.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the money.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI ought to tell you that we had it from papa.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nOh, I see. It was just about that time that he died, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes; and, just think of it, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go and nurse him. I was\r\nexpecting little Ivar\xe2\x80\x99s birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald\r\nto look after. My dear, kind father\xe2\x80\x94I never saw him again, Christine.\r\nThat was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI know how fond you were of him. And then you went off to Italy?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our going,\r\nso we started a month later.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd your husband came back quite well?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAs sound as a bell!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94the doctor?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat doctor?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just as I did,\r\nwas the doctor?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come here professionally. He\r\nis our greatest friend, and comes in at least once every day. No,\r\nTorvald has not had an hour\xe2\x80\x99s illness since then, and our children are\r\nstrong and healthy and so am I. _[Jumps up and claps her hands.]_\r\nChristine! Christine! it\xe2\x80\x99s good to be alive and happy!\xe2\x80\x94But how horrid\r\nof me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. _[Sits on a stool\r\nnear her, and rests her arms on her knees.]_ You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with\r\nme. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your husband? Why\r\ndid you marry him?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nMy mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless, and I had to\r\nprovide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I was justified\r\nin refusing his offer.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time, then?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI believe he was quite well off. But his business was a precarious one;\r\nand, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was nothing left.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd then?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWell, I had to turn my hand to anything I could find\xe2\x80\x94first a small\r\nshop, then a small school, and so on. The last three years have seemed\r\nlike one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end, Nora. My\r\npoor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the boys do not need\r\nme either; they have got situations and can shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat a relief you must feel if\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to live for\r\nanymore. _[Gets up restlessly.]_ That was why I could not stand the\r\nlife in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be easier here to\r\nfind something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts. If only I\r\ncould have the good luck to get some regular work\xe2\x80\x94office work of some\r\nkind\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look tired out\r\nnow. You had far better go away to some watering-place.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[walking to the window]_. I have no father to give me money for a\r\njourney, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[rising]_. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[going up to her]_. It is you that must not be angry with me, dear.\r\nThe worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No\r\none to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for\r\nchances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of\r\nthe happy turn your fortunes have taken\xe2\x80\x94you will hardly believe it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwas delighted not so much on your account as on my own.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x94Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald could\r\nget you something to do.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, that was what I was thinking of.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHe must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject very\r\ncleverly\xe2\x80\x94I will think of something that will please him very much. It\r\nwill make me so happy to be of some use to you.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nHow kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is doubly kind\r\nin you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles of life.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94? I know so little of them?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[smiling]_. My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!\xe2\x80\x94You\r\nare a child, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[tosses her head and crosses the stage]_. You ought not to be so\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou are just like the others. They all think that I am incapable of\r\nanything really serious\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nCome, come\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your troubles.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPooh!\xe2\x80\x94those were trifles. _[Lowering her voice.]_ I have not told you\r\nthe important thing.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThe important thing? What do you mean?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou look down upon me altogether, Christine\xe2\x80\x94but you ought not to. You\r\nare proud, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, of having worked so hard and so long for your\r\nmother?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIndeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t look down on anyone. But it is true that I am both\r\nproud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end of my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s life almost free from care.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd you are proud to think of what you have done for your brothers?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI think I have the right to be.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something to be\r\nproud and glad of.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSpeak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn\xe2\x80\x99t on any account\xe2\x80\x94no\r\none in the world must know, Christine, except you.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut what is it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nCome here. _[Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.]_ Now I will show\r\nyou that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who\r\nsaved Torvald\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaved\xe2\x80\x9d? How?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have recovered\r\nif he had not gone there\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[smiling]_. Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPapa didn\xe2\x80\x99t give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou? All that large sum?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTwo hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a prize in the\r\nLottery?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[contemptuously]_. In the Lottery? There would have been no credit in\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut where did you get it from, then? Nora _[humming and smiling with an\r\nair of mystery]_. Hm, hm! Aha!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBecause you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have borrowed it.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Why not?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, a wife cannot borrow without her husband\xe2\x80\x99s consent.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[tossing her head]_. Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it at all, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThere is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the money. I\r\nmay have got it some other way. _[Lies back on the sofa.]_ Perhaps I\r\ngot it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive as I am\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou are a mad creature.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNow, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re full of curiosity, Christine.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nListen to me, Nora dear. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been a little bit imprudent?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[sits up straight]_. Is it imprudent to save your husband\xe2\x80\x99s life?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIt seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My goodness,\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t you understand that? It was necessary he should have no idea what\r\na dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors came and\r\nsaid that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to save him\r\nwas to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try, first of all, to\r\nget what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much I\r\nshould love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and\r\nentreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition\r\nI was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even\r\nhinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,\r\nChristine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my\r\nhusband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices\xe2\x80\x94as I believe he\r\ncalled them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved\xe2\x80\x94and that was how I\r\ncame to devise a way out of the difficulty\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd did your husband never get to know from your father that the money\r\nhad not come from him?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him into the\r\nsecret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill then\xe2\x80\x94alas,\r\nthere never was any need to tell him.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd since then have you never told your secret to your husband?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nGood Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such strong\r\nopinions about these things! And besides, how painful and humiliating\r\nit would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to know that he\r\nowed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations altogether; our\r\nbeautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nDo you mean never to tell him about it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[meditatively, and with a half smile]_. Yes\xe2\x80\x94someday, perhaps, after\r\nmany years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlaugh at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to\r\nme as he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have\r\npalled on him; then it may be a good thing to have something in\r\nreserve\xe2\x80\x94_[Breaking off.]_ What nonsense! That time will never come.\r\nNow, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do you still\r\nthink I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has caused\r\nme a lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my\r\nengagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is\r\ncalled, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called\r\npayment in installments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to\r\nmanage them. I have had to save a little here and there, where I could,\r\nyou understand. I have not been able to put aside much from my\r\nhousekeeping money, for Torvald must have a good table. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nmy children be shabbily dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he\r\ngave me for them, the sweet little darlings!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nSo it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of life, poor\r\nNora?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOf course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever Torvald\r\nhas given me money for new dresses and such things, I have never spent\r\nmore than half of it; I have always bought the simplest and cheapest\r\nthings. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and so Torvald has\r\nnever noticed it. But it was often very hard on me, Christine\xe2\x80\x94because\r\nit is delightful to be really well dressed, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nQuite so.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWell, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter I was\r\nlucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up and\r\nsat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I was\r\ndesperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to sit\r\nthere working and earning money. It was like being a man.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nHow much have you been able to pay off in that way?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an\r\naccount of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid\r\nevery penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits\xe2\x80\x99\r\nend. _[Smiles.]_ Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old\r\ngentleman had fallen in love with me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWhat! Who was it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBe quiet!\xe2\x80\x94that he had died; and that when his will was opened it\r\ncontained, written in big letters, the instruction: \xe2\x80\x9cThe lovely Mrs\r\nNora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at once in cash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut, my dear Nora\xe2\x80\x94who could the man be?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nGood gracious, can\xe2\x80\x99t you understand? There was no old gentleman at all;\r\nit was only something that I used to sit here and imagine, when I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of any way of procuring money. But it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same\r\nnow; the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far as I am\r\nconcerned; I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about him or his will either, for I am free\r\nfrom care now. _[Jumps up.]_ My goodness, it\xe2\x80\x99s delightful to think of,\r\nChristine! Free from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free\r\nfrom care; to be able to play and romp with the children; to be able to\r\nkeep the house beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes\r\nit! And, think of it, soon the spring will come and the big blue sky!\r\nPerhaps we shall be able to take a little trip\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I shall see the\r\nsea again! Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy. _[A\r\nbell is heard in the hall.]_\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[rising]_. There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t go; no one will come in here; it is sure to be for Torvald.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\n_[at the hall door]_. Excuse me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94there is a gentleman to see the\r\nmaster, and as the doctor is with him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWho is it?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[at the door]_. It is I, Mrs Helmer. _[Mrs LINDE starts, trembles, and\r\nturns to the window.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained, low voice]_. You?\r\nWhat is it? What do you want to see my husband about?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nBank business\xe2\x80\x94in a way. I have a small post in the Bank, and I hear\r\nyour husband is to be our chief now\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThen it is\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nNothing but dry business matters, Mrs Helmer; absolutely nothing else.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBe so good as to go into the study, then. _[She bows indifferently to\r\nhim and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up the\r\nfire in the stove.]_\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNora\xe2\x80\x94who was that man?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nA lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThen it really was he.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDo you know the man?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI used to\xe2\x80\x94many years ago. At one time he was a solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s clerk in our\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, he was.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nHe is greatly altered.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHe made a very unhappy marriage.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nHe is a widower now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWith several children. There now, it is burning up. [Shuts the door of\r\nthe stove and moves the rocking-chair aside.]\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThey say he carries on various kinds of business.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nReally! Perhaps he does; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it. But don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nus think of business; it is so tiresome.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR RANK.\r\n_[comes out of HELMER\xe2\x80\x99S study. Before he shuts the door he calls to\r\nhim]_. No, my dear fellow, I won\xe2\x80\x99t disturb you; I would rather go in to\r\nyour wife for a little while. _[Shuts the door and sees Mrs LINDE.]_ I\r\nbeg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, not at all. _[Introducing him]_. Doctor Rank, Mrs Linde.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI have often heard Mrs Linde\xe2\x80\x99s name mentioned here. I think I passed\r\nyou on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs Linde?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, I go up very slowly; I can\xe2\x80\x99t manage stairs well.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nAh! some slight internal weakness?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, the fact is I have been overworking myself.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nNothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to amuse\r\nyourself with our entertainments?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI have come to look for work.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nIs that a good cure for overwork?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nOne must live, Doctor Rank.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nLook here, Doctor Rank\xe2\x80\x94you know you want to live.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nCertainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the agony as\r\nlong as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are those who\r\nare morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case too, is at this very\r\nmoment with Helmer\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[sadly]_. Ah!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhom do you mean?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nA lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don\xe2\x80\x99t know at all. He\r\nsuffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs Helmer; but even he began\r\ntalking of its being highly important that he should live.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDid he? What did he want to speak to Torvald about?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI have no idea; I only heard that it was something about the Bank.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know this\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s his name\xe2\x80\x94Krogstad had anything to do with the\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, he has some sort of appointment there. _[To Mrs Linde.]_ I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow whether you find also in your part of the world that there are\r\ncertain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral\r\ncorruption, and, as soon as they have found some, put the person\r\nconcerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on\r\nhim. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nStill I think the sick are those who most need taking care of.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[shrugging his shoulders]_. Yes, there you are. That is the sentiment\r\nthat is turning Society into a sick-house.\r\n\r\n_[NORA, who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into\r\nsmothered laughter and claps her hands.]_\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWhy do you laugh at that? Have you any notion what Society really is?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at something quite\r\ndifferent, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are all\r\nthe people who are employed in the Bank dependent on Torvald now?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nIs that what you find so extremely amusing?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[smiling and humming]_. That\xe2\x80\x99s my affair! _[Walking about the room.]_\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly glorious to think that we have\xe2\x80\x94that Torvald has so much\r\npower over so many people. _[Takes the packet from her pocket.]_ Doctor\r\nRank, what do you say to a macaroon?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWhat, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, but these are some Christine gave me.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWhat! I?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, well, don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed! You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know that Torvald had\r\nforbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my\r\nteeth. But, bah!\xe2\x80\x94once in a way\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s so, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Doctor Rank? By\r\nyour leave! _[Puts a macaroon into his mouth.]_ You must have one too,\r\nChristine. And I shall have one, just a little one\xe2\x80\x94or at most two.\r\n_[Walking about.]_ I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in\r\nthe world now that I should dearly love to do.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWell, what is that?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s something I should dearly love to say, if Torvald could hear me.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWell, why can\xe2\x80\x99t you say it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I daren\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99s so shocking.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nShocking?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWell, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you might. What\r\nis it you would so much like to say if Torvald could hear you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI should just love to say\xe2\x80\x94Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m damned!\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nAre you mad?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNora, dear\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nSay it, here he is!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[hiding the packet]_. Hush! Hush! Hush! _[HELMER comes out of his\r\nroom, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWell, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, he has just gone.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nLet me introduce you\xe2\x80\x94this is Christine, who has come to town.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nChristine\xe2\x80\x94? Excuse me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nMrs Linde, dear; Christine Linde.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOf course. A school friend of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s, I presume?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, we have known each other since then.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd just think, she has taken a long journey in order to see you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, really, I\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nChristine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she is\r\nfrightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nVery sensible, Mrs Linde.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd when she heard you had been appointed manager of the Bank\xe2\x80\x94the news\r\nwas telegraphed, you know\xe2\x80\x94she travelled here as quick as she could.\r\nTorvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for Christine, for\r\nmy sake, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell, it is not altogether impossible. I presume you are a widow, Mrs\r\nLinde?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd have had some experience of book-keeping?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, a fair amount.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAh! well, it\xe2\x80\x99s very likely I may be able to find something for you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[clapping her hands]_. What did I tell you? What did I tell you?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou have just come at a fortunate moment, Mrs Linde.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nHow am I to thank you?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThere is no need. _[Puts on his coat.]_ But today you must excuse me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWait a minute; I will come with you. _[Brings his fur coat from the\r\nhall and warms it at the fire.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be long away, Torvald dear.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAbout an hour, not more.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAre you going too, Christine?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[putting on her cloak]_. Yes, I must go and look for a room.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOh, well then, we can walk down the street together.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[helping her]_. What a pity it is we are so short of space here; I am\r\nafraid it is impossible for us\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it! Goodbye, Nora dear, and many thanks.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nGoodbye for the present. Of course you will come back this evening. And\r\nyou too, Dr. Rank. What do you say? If you are well enough? Oh, you\r\nmust be! Wrap yourself up well. _[They go to the door all talking\r\ntogether. Children\xe2\x80\x99s voices are heard on the staircase.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThere they are! There they are! _[She runs to open the door. The NURSE\r\ncomes in with the children.]_ Come in! Come in! _[Stoops and kisses\r\nthem.]_ Oh, you sweet blessings! Look at them, Christine! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ndarlings?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us stand here in the draught.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nCome along, Mrs Linde; the place will only be bearable for a mother\r\nnow!\r\n\r\n_[RANK, HELMER, and Mrs Linde go downstairs. The NURSE comes forward\r\nwith the children; NORA shuts the hall door.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow fresh and well you look! Such red cheeks like apples and roses.\r\n_[The children all talk at once while she speaks to them.]_ Have you\r\nhad great fun? That\xe2\x80\x99s splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob\r\nalong on the sledge? \xe2\x80\x94both at once?\xe2\x80\x94that was good. You are a clever\r\nboy, Ivar. Let me take her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby\r\ndoll! _[Takes the baby from the MAID and dances it up and down.]_ Yes,\r\nyes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you been snowballing? I\r\nwish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their things off, Anne;\r\nplease let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look half frozen.\r\nThere is some hot coffee for you on the stove.\r\n\r\n_[The NURSE goes into the room on the left. NORA takes off the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s things and throws them about, while they all talk to her at\r\nonce.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nReally! Did a big dog run after you? But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t bite you? No, dogs\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t bite nice little dolly children. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look at the parcels,\r\nIvar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you would like to know. No, no\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething nasty! Come, let us have a game! What shall we play at? Hide\r\nand Seek? Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll play Hide and Seek. Bob shall hide first. Must I\r\nhide? Very well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hide first. _[She and the children laugh and\r\nshout, and romp in and out of the room; at last NORA hides under the\r\ntable, the children rush in and out for her, but do not see her; they\r\nhear her smothered laughter, run to the table, lift up the cloth and\r\nfind her. Shouts of laughter. She crawls forward and pretends to\r\nfrighten them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile there has been a knock at the\r\nhall door, but none of them has noticed it. The door is half opened,\r\nand KROGSTAD appears, he waits a little; the game goes on.]_\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nExcuse me, Mrs Helmer.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[with a stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees]_. Ah!\r\nwhat do you want?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nExcuse me, the outer door was ajar; I suppose someone forgot to shut\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[rising]_. My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI know that.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you want here, then?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nA word with you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWith me?\xe2\x80\x94_[To the children, gently.]_ Go in to nurse. What? No, the\r\nstrange man won\xe2\x80\x99t do mother any harm. When he has gone we will have\r\nanother game. _[She takes the children into the room on the left, and\r\nshuts the door after them.]_ You want to speak to me?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYes, I do.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nToday? It is not the first of the month yet.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nNo, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself what sort of a\r\nChristmas you will spend.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you mean? Today it is absolutely impossible for me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWe won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that until later on. This is something different. I\r\npresume you can give me a moment?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94yes, I can\xe2\x80\x94although\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nGood. I was in Olsen\xe2\x80\x99s Restaurant and saw your husband going down the\r\nstreet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWith a lady.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nMay I make so bold as to ask if it was a Mrs Linde?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt was.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nJust arrived in town?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, today.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nShe is a great friend of yours, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nShe is. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI knew her too, once upon a time.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am aware of that.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAre you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I can ask\r\nyou, without beating about the bush\xe2\x80\x94is Mrs Linde to have an appointment\r\nin the Bank?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?\xe2\x80\x94You, one of my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs\r\nLinde is to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded her cause,\r\nMr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI was right in what I thought, then.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[walking up and down the stage]_. Sometimes one has a tiny little bit\r\nof influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does not\r\nnecessarily follow that\xe2\x80\x94. When anyone is in a subordinate position, Mr.\r\nKrogstad, they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWho has influence?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[changing his tone]_. Mrs Helmer, you will be so good as to use your\r\ninfluence on my behalf.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat? What do you mean?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYou will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep my subordinate\r\nposition in the Bank.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post away from you?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of ignorance. I can\r\nquite understand that your friend is not very anxious to expose herself\r\nto the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I quite understand,\r\ntoo, whom I have to thank for being turned off.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut I assure you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nVery likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come when I should\r\nadvise you to use your influence to prevent that.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut, Mr. Krogstad, I have no influence.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you? I thought you said yourself just now\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNaturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I! What\r\nshould make you think I have any influence of that kind with my\r\nhusband?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOh, I have known your husband from our student days. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he\r\nis any more unassailable than other husbands.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIf you speak slightingly of my husband, I shall turn you out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYou are bold, Mrs Helmer.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am not afraid of you any longer. As soon as the New Year comes, I\r\nshall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[controlling himself]_. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. If necessary, I am\r\nprepared to fight for my small post in the Bank as if I were fighting\r\nfor my life.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSo it seems.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIt is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that weighs least\r\nwith me in the matter. There is another reason\xe2\x80\x94well, I may as well tell\r\nyou. My position is this. I daresay you know, like everybody else, that\r\nonce, many years ago, I was guilty of an indiscretion.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI think I have heard something of the kind.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThe matter never came into court; but every way seemed to be closed to\r\nme after that. So I took to the business that you know of. I had to do\r\nsomething; and, honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been one of the worst. But\r\nnow I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing up; for\r\ntheir sake I must try and win back as much respect as I can in the\r\ntown. This post in the Bank was like the first step up for me\xe2\x80\x94and now\r\nyour husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my power to help\r\nyou at all.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThen it is because you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the will; but I have means to compel\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you money?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nHm!\xe2\x80\x94suppose I were to tell him?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt would be perfectly infamous of you. _[Sobbing.]_ To think of his\r\nlearning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly,\r\nclumsy way\xe2\x80\x94that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a\r\nhorribly disagreeable position\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOnly disagreeable?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[impetuously]_. Well, do it, then!\xe2\x80\x94and it will be the worse for you.\r\nMy husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you\r\ncertainly won\xe2\x80\x99t keep your post then.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that you were\r\nafraid of?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIf my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at once pay you\r\nwhat is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do with you.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[coming a step nearer]_. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. Either you have a\r\nvery bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall be obliged\r\nto remind you of a few details.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWhen your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two hundred and\r\nfifty pounds.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone else to go to.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI promised to get you that amount\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, and you did so.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions. Your mind was\r\nso taken up with your husband\xe2\x80\x99s illness, and you were so anxious to get\r\nthe money for your journey, that you seem to have paid no attention to\r\nthe conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be amiss if I\r\nremind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the security of\r\na bond which I drew up.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, and which I signed.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nGood. But below your signature there were a few lines constituting your\r\nfather a surety for the money; those lines your father should have\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nShould? He did sign them.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI had left the date blank; that is to say, your father should himself\r\nhave inserted the date on which he signed the paper. Do you remember\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I think I remember\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThen I gave you the bond to send by post to your father. Is that not\r\nso?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAnd you naturally did so at once, because five or six days afterwards\r\nyou brought me the bond with your father\xe2\x80\x99s signature. And then I gave\r\nyou the money.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWell, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I been paying it off regularly?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nFairly so, yes. But\xe2\x80\x94to come back to the matter in hand\xe2\x80\x94that must have\r\nbeen a very trying time for you, Mrs Helmer?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt was, indeed.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYour father was very ill, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHe was very near his end.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAnd died soon afterwards?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nTell me, Mrs Helmer, can you by any chance remember what day your\r\nfather died?\xe2\x80\x94on what day of the month, I mean.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPapa died on the 29th of September.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThat is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And, as that is so,\r\nthere is a discrepancy _[taking a paper from his pocket]_ which I\r\ncannot account for.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat discrepancy? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThe discrepancy consists, Mrs Helmer, in the fact that your father\r\nsigned this bond three days after his death.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you mean? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYour father died on the 29th of September. But, look here; your father\r\nhas dated his signature the 2nd of October. It is a discrepancy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit? _[NORA is silent.]_ Can you explain it to me? _[NORA is still\r\nsilent.]_ It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words \xe2\x80\x9c2nd of\r\nOctober,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the year, are not written in your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be\r\nexplained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and\r\nsomeone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death.\r\nThere is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name;\r\nand that is genuine, I suppose, Mrs Helmer? It was your father himself\r\nwho signed his name here?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[after a short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at him]_.\r\nNo, it was not. It was I that wrote papa\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAre you aware that is a dangerous confession?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIn what way? You shall have your money soon.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nLet me ask you a question; why did you not send the paper to your\r\nfather?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for his\r\nsignature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be used\r\nfor; and when he was so ill himself I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him that my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s life was in danger\xe2\x80\x94it was impossible.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIt would have been better for you if you had given up your trip abroad.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband\xe2\x80\x99s life; I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give that up.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nBut did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraud on me?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take that into account; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble myself about you at\r\nall. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear you, because you put so many heartless\r\ndifficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my\r\nhusband was in.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nMrs Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what it is that you\r\nhave been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one false step, which\r\nlost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing worse than what\r\nyou have done.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a risk\r\nto save your wife\xe2\x80\x99s life?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThe law cares nothing about motives.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThen it must be a very foolish law.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nFoolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged, if I produce\r\nthis paper in court.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her dying\r\nfather anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s life? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about law; but I am certain that\r\nthere must be laws permitting such things as that. Have you no\r\nknowledge of such laws\xe2\x80\x94you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor\r\nlawyer, Mr. Krogstad.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nMaybe. But matters of business\xe2\x80\x94such business as you and I have had\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94do you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that? Very well. Do as you\r\nplease. But let me tell you this\xe2\x80\x94if I lose my position a second time,\r\nyou shall lose yours with me. _[He bows, and goes out through the\r\nhall.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[appears buried in thought for a short time, then tosses her head]_.\r\nNonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!\xe2\x80\x94I am not so silly as he\r\nthinks. _[Begins to busy herself putting the children\xe2\x80\x99s things in\r\norder.]_ And yet\xe2\x80\x94? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible! I did it for love\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN.\r\n_[in the doorway on the left]_. Mother, the stranger man has gone out\r\nthrough the gate.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, dears, I know. But, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone about the stranger man. Do\r\nyou hear? Not even papa.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN.\r\nNo, mother; but will you come and play again?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, no,\xe2\x80\x94not now.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN.\r\nBut, mother, you promised us.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t now. Run away in; I have such a lot to do. Run away\r\nin, my sweet little darlings. _[She gets them into the room by degrees\r\nand shuts the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes up a\r\npiece of needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops.]_ No!\r\n_[Throws down the work, gets up, goes to the hall door and calls out.]_\r\nHelen! bring the Tree in. _[Goes to the table on the left, opens a\r\ndrawer, and stops again.]_ No, no! it is quite impossible!\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\n_[coming in with the Tree]_. Where shall I put it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHere, in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nShall I get you anything else?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, thank you. I have all I want. [Exit MAID.]\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[begins dressing the tree]_. A candle here-and flowers here\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nhorrible man! It\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong. The tree shall\r\nbe splendid! I will do everything I can think of to please you,\r\nTorvald!\xe2\x80\x94I will sing for you, dance for you\xe2\x80\x94_[HELMER comes in with some\r\npapers under his arm.]_ Oh! are you back already?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes. Has anyone been here?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHere? No.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat is strange. I saw Krogstad going out of the gate.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDid you? Oh yes, I forgot, Krogstad was here for a moment.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora, I can see from your manner that he has been here begging you to\r\nsay a good word for him.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd you were to appear to do it of your own accord; you were to conceal\r\nfrom me the fact of his having been here; didn\xe2\x80\x99t he beg that of you\r\ntoo?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, Torvald, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora, Nora, and you would be a party to that sort of thing? To have any\r\ntalk with a man like that, and give him any sort of promise? And to\r\ntell me a lie into the bargain?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nA lie\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me no one had been here? _[Shakes his finger at her.]_\r\nMy little songbird must never do that again. A songbird must have a\r\nclean beak to chirp with\xe2\x80\x94no false notes! _[Puts his arm round her\r\nwaist.]_ That is so, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Yes, I am sure it is. _[Lets her go.]_\r\nWe will say no more about it. _[Sits down by the stove.]_ How warm and\r\nsnug it is here! _[Turns over his papers.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[after a short pause, during which she busies herself with the\r\nChristmas Tree.]_ Torvald!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am looking forward tremendously to the fancy-dress ball at the\r\nStenborgs\xe2\x80\x99 the day after tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd I am tremendously curious to see what you are going to surprise me\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt was very silly of me to want to do that.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t hit upon anything that will do; everything I think of seems so\r\nsilly and insignificant.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDoes my little Nora acknowledge that at last?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[standing behind his chair with her arms on the back of it]_. Are you\r\nvery busy, Torvald?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat are all those papers?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBank business.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAlready?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nI have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake the\r\nnecessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work;\r\nand I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to have\r\neverything in order for the new year.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThen that was why this poor Krogstad\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHm!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair]_. If you\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big favour,\r\nTorvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat is that? Tell me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThere is no one has such good taste as you. And I do so want to look\r\nnice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you take me in hand and\r\ndecide what I shall go as, and what sort of a dress I shall wear?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAha! so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone to come to\r\nher rescue?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, Torvald, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get along a bit without your help.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nVery well, I will think it over, we shall manage to hit upon something.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat is nice of you. _[Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short pause.]_ How\r\npretty the red flowers look\xe2\x80\x94. But, tell me, was it really something\r\nvery bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHe forged someone\xe2\x80\x99s name. Have you any idea what that means?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so heartless as\r\nto condemn a man altogether because of a single false step of that\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, would you, Torvald?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMany a man has been able to retrieve his character, if he has openly\r\nconfessed his fault and taken his punishment.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPunishment\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out of it by a\r\ncunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut do you think it would\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nJust think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the hypocrite\r\nwith every one, how he has to wear a mask in the presence of those near\r\nand dear to him, even before his own wife and children. And about the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94that is the most terrible part of it all, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBecause such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole life\r\nof a home. Each breath the children take in such a house is full of the\r\ngerms of evil.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[coming nearer him]_. Are you sure of that?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMy dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer.\r\nAlmost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a\r\ndeceitful mother.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhy do you only say\xe2\x80\x94mother?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIt seems most commonly to be the mother\xe2\x80\x99s influence, though naturally a\r\nbad father\xe2\x80\x99s would have the same result. Every lawyer is familiar with\r\nthe fact. This Krogstad, now, has been persistently poisoning his own\r\nchildren with lies and dissimulation; that is why I say he has lost all\r\nmoral character. _[Holds out his hands to her.]_ That is why my sweet\r\nlittle Nora must promise me not to plead his cause. Give me your hand\r\non it. Come, come, what is this? Give me your hand. There now, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsettled. I assure you it would be quite impossible for me to work with\r\nhim; I literally feel physically ill when I am in the company of such\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the\r\nChristmas Tree]_. How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[getting up and putting his papers in order]_. Yes, and I must try and\r\nread through some of these before dinner; and I must think about your\r\ncostume, too. And it is just possible I may have something ready in\r\ngold paper to hang up on the Tree. _[Puts his hand on her head.]_ My\r\nprecious little singing-bird! _[He goes into his room and shuts the\r\ndoor after him.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[after a pause, whispers]_. No, no\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible; it\r\nmust be impossible.\r\n\r\n_[The NURSE opens the door on the left.]_\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nThe little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to mamma.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, no, no! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them come in to me! You stay with them, Anne.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nVery well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. _[Shuts the door.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[pale with terror]_. Deprave my little children? Poison my home? _[A\r\nshort pause. Then she tosses her head.]_ It\xe2\x80\x99s not true. It can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II\r\n\r\n\r\n_[THE SAME SCENE.\xe2\x80\x94THE Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,\r\nstripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its\r\ndishevelled branches. NORA\xe2\x80\x99S cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She\r\nis alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and\r\ntakes up her cloak.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[drops her cloak]_. Someone is coming now! _[Goes to the door and\r\nlistens.]_ No\xe2\x80\x94it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,\r\nChristmas Day\xe2\x80\x94nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94_[opens the door and\r\nlooks out]_. No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. _[Comes\r\nforward.]_ What rubbish! of course he can\xe2\x80\x99t be in earnest about it.\r\nSuch a thing couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen; it is impossible\xe2\x80\x94I have three little\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n_[Enter the NURSE from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard\r\nbox.]_\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAt last I have found the box with the fancy dress.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThanks; put it on the table.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\n_[doing so]_. But it is very much in want of mending.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWhat an idea! It can easily be put in order\xe2\x80\x94just a little patience.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWhat, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nand make yourself ill.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWell, worse than that might happen. How are the children?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nThe poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDo they ask much for me?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYou see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I\r\nwas before.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nOh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDo you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she\r\nwent away altogether?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x94went away altogether?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered about\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ncould you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora\xe2\x80\x99s nurse.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, but how could you be willing to do it?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWhat, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A poor girl who\r\nhas got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that wicked man didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo a single thing for me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNo, indeed she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. She wrote to me when she was confirmed, and when\r\nshe was married.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[putting her arms round her neck]_. Dear old Anne, you were a good\r\nmother to me when I was little.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nLittle Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd if my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you would\xe2\x80\x94What\r\nnonsense I am talking! _[Opens the box.]_ Go in to them. Now I must\xe2\x80\x94.\r\nYou will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n_[Goes into the room on the left.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from her]_. If only\r\nI dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I could be sure\r\nnothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and nonsense! No one\r\nwill come. Only I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think about it. I will brush my muff. What\r\nlovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One,\r\ntwo, three, four, five, six\xe2\x80\x94 _[Screams.]_ Ah! there is someone coming\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n_[Makes a movement towards the door, but stands irresolute.]_\r\n\r\n_[Enter Mrs Linde from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and\r\nhat.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is there? How\r\ngood of you to come!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI heard you were up asking for me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you could\r\nhelp me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow\r\nevening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs\xe2\x80\x99, who live\r\nabove us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and\r\ndance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI see; you are going to keep up the character.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had it made\r\nfor me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any idea\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWe will easily put that right. It is only some of the trimming come\r\nunsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that\xe2\x80\x99s all we want.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt is nice of you.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[sewing]_. So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will\r\ntell you what\xe2\x80\x94I shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine\r\nfeathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful\r\nevening yesterday.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[gets up, and crosses the stage]_. Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think yesterday was\r\nas pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a little earlier,\r\nChristine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make a house dainty\r\nand attractive.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter for\r\nnothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as he was\r\nyesterday?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he suffers\r\nfrom a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine, poor\r\ncreature. His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of\r\nexcesses; and that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do you\r\nunderstand?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[dropping her sewing]_. But, my dearest Nora, how do you know anything\r\nabout such things?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[walking about]_. Pooh! When you have three children, you get visits\r\nnow and then from\xe2\x80\x94from married women, who know something of medical\r\nmatters, and they talk about one thing and another.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[goes on sewing. A short silence]_. Does Doctor Rank come here\r\neveryday?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nEveryday regularly. He is Torvald\xe2\x80\x99s most intimate friend, and a great\r\nfriend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut tell me this\xe2\x80\x94is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he the kind of\r\nman that is very anxious to make himself agreeable?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNot in the least. What makes you think that?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWhen you introduced him to me yesterday, he declared he had often heard\r\nmy name mentioned in this house; but afterwards I noticed that your\r\nhusband hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest idea who I was. So how could Doctor Rank\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat is quite right, Christine. Torvald is so absurdly fond of me that\r\nhe wants me absolutely to himself, as he says. At first he used to seem\r\nalmost jealous if I mentioned any of the dear folk at home, so\r\nnaturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk about such things with\r\nDoctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nListen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child in many things, and\r\nI am older than you in many ways and have a little more experience. Let\r\nme tell you this\xe2\x80\x94you ought to make an end of it with Doctor Rank.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat ought I to make an end of?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nOf two things, I think. Yesterday you talked some nonsense about a rich\r\nadmirer who was to leave you money\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAn admirer who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, unfortunately! But what then?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIs Doctor Rank a man of means?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, he is.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd has no one to provide for?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, no one; but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd comes here everyday?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I told you so.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut how can this well-bred man be so tactless?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you at all.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose I don\xe2\x80\x99t guess who lent you the\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAre you out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A friend\r\nof ours, who comes here everyday! Do you realise what a horribly\r\npainful position that would be?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThen it really isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for a\r\nmoment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his money\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWell, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank. Although\r\nI am quite sure that if I had asked him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut of course you won\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOf course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be\r\nnecessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBehind your husband\xe2\x80\x99s back?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI must make an end of it with the other one, and that will be behind\r\nhis back too. I must make an end of it with him.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, that is what I told you yesterday, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[walking up and down]_. A man can put a thing like that straight much\r\neasier than a woman\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nOne\xe2\x80\x99s husband, yes.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNonsense! _[Standing still.]_ When you pay off a debt you get your bond\r\nback, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it up\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnasty dirty paper!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly]_. Nora,\r\nyou are concealing something from me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDo I look as if I were?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nSomething has happened to you since yesterday morning. Nora, what is\r\nit?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[going nearer to her]_. Christine! _[Listens.]_ Hush! there\xe2\x80\x99s Torvald\r\ncome home. Do you mind going in to the children for the present?\r\nTorvald can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[gathering some of the things together]_. Certainly\xe2\x80\x94but I am not going\r\naway from here until we have had it out with one another. _[She goes\r\ninto the room on the left, as HELMER comes in from the hall.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[going up to HELMER]_. I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWas that the dressmaker?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in order. You\r\nwill see I shall look quite smart.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t that a happy thought of mine, now?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSplendid! But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it is nice of me, too, to do as you wish?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNice?\xe2\x80\x94because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well, you little\r\nrogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am not going to\r\ndisturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I expect.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI suppose you are going to work.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes. _[Shows her a bundle of papers.]_ Look at that. I have just been\r\ninto the bank. _[Turns to go into his room.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTorvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIf your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very\r\nprettily\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWould you do it?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nI should like to hear what it is, first.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYour squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would be\r\nnice, and do what she wants.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nSpeak plainly.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYour skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song rising and\r\nfalling\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell, my skylark does that anyhow.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight, Torvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora\xe2\x80\x94you surely don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that request you made to me this morning?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[going near him]_. Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHave you really the courage to open up that question again?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, dear, you must do as I ask; you must let Krogstad keep his post in\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMy dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs Linde shall have.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just as well\r\ndismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThis is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give him a\r\nthoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected to\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This fellow\r\nwrites in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so yourself.\r\nHe can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened to death\r\nof him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAh, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNaturally you are thinking of your father.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these malicious\r\ncreatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they\r\nslandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the\r\nDepartment had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not\r\nbeen so kindly disposed and helpful to him.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMy little Nora, there is an important difference between your father\r\nand me. Your father\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a public official was not above\r\nsuspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long as I\r\nhold my office.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We ought to be\r\nso well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home, and have no\r\ncares\xe2\x80\x94you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I beg you so\r\nearnestly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd it is just by interceding for him that you make it impossible for\r\nme to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I mean to dismiss\r\nKrogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his\r\nmind at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s bidding\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd what if it did?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOf course!\xe2\x80\x94if only this obstinate little person can get her way! Do you\r\nsuppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole staff, to\r\nlet people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of outside\r\ninfluence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can tell\r\nyou! And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible for\r\nme to have Krogstad in the Bank as long as I am manager.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhatever is that?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHis moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if necessary\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, you could\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we were boys.\r\nIt was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an incubus in\r\nafterlife. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on very\r\nintimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no\r\nrestraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary, he\r\nthinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and\r\nevery minute it is \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Helmer, old fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d and that sort of thing.\r\nI assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position\r\nin the Bank intolerable.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTorvald, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you mean that.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you? Why not?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBecause it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am narrow-minded?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, just the opposite, dear\xe2\x80\x94and it is exactly for that reason.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded, so I\r\nmust be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well\xe2\x80\x94I must put an end to this.\r\n_[Goes to the hall door and calls.]_ Helen!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat are you going to do?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[looking among his papers]_. Settle it. _[Enter MAID.]_ Look here;\r\ntake this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger\r\nand tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it, and\r\nhere is the money.\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nVery well, sir. _[Exit with the letter.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[putting his papers together]_. Now then, little Miss Obstinate.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[breathlessly]_. Torvald\xe2\x80\x94what was that letter?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nKrogstad\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nCall her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call her back!\r\nDo it for my sake\xe2\x80\x94for your own sake\xe2\x80\x94for the children\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Do you\r\nhear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that letter can\r\nbring upon us.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMy dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although really it\r\nis an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it an insult to think that I\r\nshould be afraid of a starving quill-driver\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance? But I forgive\r\nyou nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your great\r\nlove for me. _[Takes her in his arms.]_ And that is as it should be, my\r\nown darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall have both\r\ncourage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man enough to\r\ntake everything upon myself.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[in a horror-stricken voice]_. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nEverything, I say\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[recovering herself]_. You will never have to do that.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and wife should.\r\nThat is how it shall be. _[Caressing her.]_ Are you content now? There!\r\nThere!\xe2\x80\x94not these frightened dove\xe2\x80\x99s eyes! The whole thing is only the\r\nwildest fancy!\xe2\x80\x94Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and\r\npractise with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and\r\nshut the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as\r\nyou please. _[Turns back at the door.]_ And when Rank comes, tell him\r\nwhere he will find me. _[Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into\r\nhis room, and shuts the door after him.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and\r\nwhispers]_. He was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in\r\nspite of everything.\xe2\x80\x94No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than\r\nthat! Oh, for some help, some way out of it! _[The door-bell rings.]_\r\nDoctor Rank! Anything rather than that\xe2\x80\x94anything, whatever it is! _[She\r\nputs her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door\r\nand opens it. RANK is standing without, hanging up his coat. During the\r\nfollowing dialogue it begins to grow dark.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nGood day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go in to\r\nTorvald now; I think he is busy with something.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nAnd you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[brings him in and shuts the door after him]_. Oh, you know very well\r\nI always have time for you.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWell, does that alarm you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to happen?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nNothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect it to happen so soon.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[gripping him by the arm]_. What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you\r\nmust tell me.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[sitting down by the stove]_. It is all up with me. And it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nhelped.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[with a sigh of relief]_. Is it about yourself?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWho else? It is no use lying to one\xe2\x80\x99s self. I am the most wretched of\r\nall my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my\r\ninternal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting\r\nin the churchyard.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat an ugly thing to say!\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThe thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I shall\r\nhave to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only make\r\none more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know\r\npretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will\r\nbegin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer\xe2\x80\x99s refined nature\r\ngives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly; I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave him in my sick-room.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, but, Doctor Rank\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to him. As\r\nsoon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send you my\r\ncard with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the\r\nloathsome end has begun.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou are quite absurd today. And I wanted you so much to be in a really\r\ngood humour.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWith death stalking beside me?\xe2\x80\x94To have to pay this penalty for another\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s sin? Is there any justice in that? And in every single family, in\r\none way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being exacted\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[putting her hands over her ears]_. Rubbish! Do talk of something\r\ncheerful.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor innocent\r\nspine has to suffer for my father\xe2\x80\x99s youthful amusements.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[sitting at the table on the left]_. I suppose you mean that he was\r\ntoo partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, and to truffles.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTruffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nOysters, of course, that goes without saying.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice things\r\nshould take their revenge on our bones.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nEspecially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky bones of\r\nthose who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the saddest part of it all.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[with a searching look at her]_. Hm!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[after a short pause]_. Why did you smile?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nNo, it was you that laughed.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[rising]_. You are a greater rascal than I thought.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am in a silly mood today.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nSo it seems.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[putting her hands on his shoulders]_. Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t take you away from Torvald and me.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nIt is a loss you would easily recover from. Those who are gone are soon\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[looking at him anxiously]_. Do you believe that?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nPeople form new ties, and then\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWho will form new ties?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nBoth you and Helmer, when I am gone. You yourself are already on the\r\nhigh road to it, I think. What did that Mrs Linde want here last night?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOho!\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you are jealous of poor Christine?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I am done for,\r\nthis woman will\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHush! don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so loud. She is in that room.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nToday again. There, you see.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nShe has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul, how\r\nunreasonable you are! _[Sits down on the sofa.]_ Be nice now, Doctor\r\nRank, and tomorrow you will see how beautifully I shall dance, and you\r\ncan imagine I am doing it all for you\xe2\x80\x94and for Torvald too, of course.\r\n_[Takes various things out of the box.]_ Doctor Rank, come and sit down\r\nhere, and I will show you something.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[sitting down]_. What is it?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nJust look at those!\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nSilk stockings.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nFlesh-coloured. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they lovely? It is so dark here now, but\r\ntomorrow\xe2\x80\x94. No, no, no! you must only look at the feet. Oh well, you may\r\nhave leave to look at the legs too.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nHm!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhy are you looking so critical? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they will fit me?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI have no means of forming an opinion about that.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[looks at him for a moment]_. For shame! _[Hits him lightly on the ear\r\nwith the stockings.]_ That\xe2\x80\x99s to punish you. _[Folds them up again.]_\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nAnd what other nice things am I to be allowed to see?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNot a single thing more, for being so naughty. _[She looks among the\r\nthings, humming to herself.]_\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[after a short silence]_. When I am sitting here, talking to you as\r\nintimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have\r\nbecome of me if I had never come into this house.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[smiling]_. I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[in a lower voice, looking straight in front of him]_. And to be\r\nobliged to leave it all\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNonsense, you are not going to leave it.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[as before]_. And not be able to leave behind one the slightest token\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret\xe2\x80\x94nothing but an\r\nempty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd if I asked you now for a\xe2\x80\x94? No!\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nFor what?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nFor a big proof of your friendship\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, yes!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI mean a tremendously big favour\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWould you really make me so happy for once?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAh, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is yet.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94but tell me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI really can\xe2\x80\x99t, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all reason; it\r\nmeans advice, and help, and a favour\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThe bigger a thing it is the better. I can\xe2\x80\x99t conceive what it is you\r\nmean. Do tell me. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I your confidence?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nMore than anyone else. I know you are my truest and best friend, and so\r\nI will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor Rank, it is something you must\r\nhelp me to prevent. You know how devotedly, how inexpressibly deeply\r\nTorvald loves me; he would never for a moment hesitate to give his life\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[leaning towards her]_. Nora\xe2\x80\x94do you think he is the only one\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[with a slight start]_. The only one\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThe only one who would gladly give his life for your sake.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[sadly]_. Is that it?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI was determined you should know it before I went away, and there will\r\nnever be a better opportunity than this. Now you know it, Nora. And now\r\nyou know, too, that you can trust me as you would trust no one else.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[rises, deliberately and quietly]_. Let me pass.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[makes room for her to pass him, but sits still]_. Nora!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[at the hall door]_. Helen, bring in the lamp. _[Goes over to the\r\nstove.]_ Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of you.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nTo have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that horrid?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, but to go and tell me so. There was really no need\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWhat do you mean? Did you know\xe2\x80\x94? _[MAID enters with lamp, puts it down\r\non the table, and goes out.]_ Nora\xe2\x80\x94Mrs Helmer\xe2\x80\x94tell me, had you any idea\r\nof this?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t? I really can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell you\xe2\x80\x94To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were getting\r\non so nicely.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWell, at all events you know now that you can command me, body and\r\nsoul. So won\xe2\x80\x99t you speak out?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[looking at him]_. After what happened?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI beg you to let me know what it is.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you anything now.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, yes. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t punish me in that way. Let me have permission to\r\ndo for you whatever a man may do.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou can do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t need any help at\r\nall. You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my part. It\r\nreally is so\xe2\x80\x94of course it is! _[Sits down in the rocking-chair, and\r\nlooks at him with a smile.]_ You are a nice sort of man, Doctor\r\nRank!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nNot a bit. But perhaps I had better go\xe2\x80\x94for ever?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as before.\r\nYou know very well Torvald can\xe2\x80\x99t do without you.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, but you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, I am always tremendously pleased when you come.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nIt is just that, that put me on the wrong track. You are a riddle to\r\nme. I have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my company\r\nas in Helmer\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94you see there are some people one loves best, and others whom one\r\nwould almost always rather have as companions.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, there is something in that.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhen I was at home, of course I loved papa best. But I always thought\r\nit tremendous fun if I could steal down into the maids\xe2\x80\x99 room, because\r\nthey never moralised at all, and talked to each other about such\r\nentertaining things.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI see\xe2\x80\x94it is their place I have taken.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[jumping up and going to him]_. Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I never\r\nmeant that at all. But surely you can understand that being with\r\nTorvald is a little like being with papa\xe2\x80\x94_[Enter MAID from the hall.]_\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nIf you please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. _[Whispers and hands her a card.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[glancing at the card]_. Oh! _[Puts it in her pocket.]_\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nIs there anything wrong?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, no, not in the least. It is only something\xe2\x80\x94it is my new dress\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWhat? Your dress is lying there.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it. Torvald mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow about it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nOho! Then that was the great secret.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOf course. Just go in to him; he is sitting in the inner room. Keep him\r\nas long as\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nMake your mind easy; I won\xe2\x80\x99t let him escape.\r\n\r\n_[Goes into HELMER\xe2\x80\x99S room.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[to the MAID]_. And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nYes; he came up the back stairs.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell him no one was in?\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nYes, but it was no good.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHe won\xe2\x80\x99t go away?\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nNo; he says he won\xe2\x80\x99t until he has seen you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWell, let him come in\xe2\x80\x94but quietly. Helen, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything\r\nabout it to anyone. It is a surprise for my husband.\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I quite understand. _[Exit.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThis dreadful thing is going to happen! It will happen in spite of me!\r\nNo, no, no, it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen\xe2\x80\x94it shan\xe2\x80\x99t happen! _[She bolts the door of\r\nHELMER\xe2\x80\x99S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it\r\nafter him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[advancing towards him]_. Speak low\xe2\x80\x94my husband is at home.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nNo matter about that.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you want of me?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAn explanation of something.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nMake haste then. What is it?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYou know, I suppose, that I have got my dismissal.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought as hard as I could on\r\nyour side, but it was no good.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nDoes your husband love you so little, then? He knows what I can expose\r\nyou to, and yet he ventures\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose so at all. It would not be the least like our dear\r\nTorvald Helmer to show so much courage\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nMr. Krogstad, a little respect for my husband, please.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nCertainly\xe2\x80\x94all the respect he deserves. But since you have kept the\r\nmatter so carefully to yourself, I make bold to suppose that you have a\r\nlittle clearer idea, than you had yesterday, of what it actually is\r\nthat you have done?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nMore than you could ever teach me.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYes, such a bad lawyer as I am.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat is it you want of me?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOnly to see how you were, Mrs Helmer. I have been thinking about you\r\nall day long. A mere cashier, a quill-driver, a\xe2\x80\x94well, a man like\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94even he has a little of what is called feeling, you know.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nShow it, then; think of my little children.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nHave you and your husband thought of mine? But never mind about that. I\r\nonly wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter too\r\nseriously. In the first place there will be no accusation made on my\r\npart.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, of course not; I was sure of that.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThe whole thing can be arranged amicably; there is no reason why anyone\r\nshould know anything about it. It will remain a secret between us\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nMy husband must never get to know anything about it.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nHow will you be able to prevent it? Am I to understand that you can pay\r\nthe balance that is owing?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, not just at present.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOr perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the money soon?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo expedient that I mean to make use of.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWell, in any case, it would have been of no use to you now. If you\r\nstood there with ever so much money in your hand, I would never part\r\nwith your bond.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTell me what purpose you mean to put it to.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI shall only preserve it\xe2\x80\x94keep it in my possession. No one who is not\r\nconcerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it. So that if\r\nthe thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt has.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIf you had it in your mind to run away from your home\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI had.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOr even something worse\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow could you know that?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nGive up the idea.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow did you know I had thought of that?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nMost of us think of that at first. I did, too\xe2\x80\x94but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the courage.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[faintly]_. No more had I.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[in a tone of relief]_. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x94you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the courage\r\neither?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nBesides, it would have been a great piece of folly. Once the first\r\nstorm at home is over\xe2\x80\x94. I have a letter for your husband in my pocket.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTelling him everything?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIn as lenient a manner as I possibly could.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[quickly]_. He mustn\xe2\x80\x99t get the letter. Tear it up. I will find some\r\nmeans of getting money.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nExcuse me, Mrs Helmer, but I think I told you just now\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am not speaking of what I owe you. Tell me what sum you are asking my\r\nhusband for, and I will get the money.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI am not asking your husband for a penny.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you want, then?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI will tell you. I want to rehabilitate myself, Mrs Helmer; I want to\r\nget on; and in that your husband must help me. For the last year and a\r\nhalf I have not had a hand in anything dishonourable, amid all that\r\ntime I have been struggling in most restricted circumstances. I was\r\ncontent to work my way up step by step. Now I am turned out, and I am\r\nnot going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again. I\r\nwant to get on, I tell you. I want to get into the Bank again, in a\r\nhigher position. Your husband must make a place for me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat he will never do!\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nHe will; I know him; he dare not protest. And as soon as I am in there\r\nagain with him, then you will see! Within a year I shall be the\r\nmanager\xe2\x80\x99s right hand. It will be Nils Krogstad and not Torvald Helmer\r\nwho manages the Bank.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a thing you will never see!\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nDo you mean that you will\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI have courage enough for it now.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOh, you can\xe2\x80\x99t frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou will see, you will see.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nUnder the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, coal-black water? And then,\r\nin the spring, to float up to the surface, all horrible and\r\nunrecognisable, with your hair fallen out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t frighten me.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nNor you me. People don\xe2\x80\x99t do such things, Mrs Helmer. Besides, what use\r\nwould it be? I should have him completely in my power all the same.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAfterwards? When I am no longer\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nHave you forgotten that it is I who have the keeping of your\r\nreputation? _[NORA stands speechlessly looking at him.]_ Well, now, I\r\nhave warned you. Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had my\r\nletter, I shall expect a message from him. And be sure you remember\r\nthat it is your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as\r\nthis again. I will never forgive him for that. Goodbye, Mrs Helmer.\r\n_[Exit through the hall.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[goes to the hall door, opens it slightly and listens.]_ He is going.\r\nHe is not putting the letter in the box. Oh no, no! that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\r\n_[Opens the door by degrees.]_ What is that? He is standing outside. He\r\nis not going downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can he\xe2\x80\x94? _[A letter drops\r\ninto the box; then KROGSTAD\xe2\x80\x99S footsteps are heard, until they die away\r\nas he goes downstairs. NORA utters a stifled cry, and runs across the\r\nroom to the table by the sofa. A short pause.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIn the letter-box. _[Steals across to the hall door.]_ There it\r\nlies\xe2\x80\x94Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!\r\n\r\n_[Mrs Linde comes in from the room on the left, carrying the dress.]_\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThere, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything more to mend now. Would you like to try it\r\non\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[in a hoarse whisper]_. Christine, come here.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[throwing the dress down on the sofa]_. What is the matter with you?\r\nYou look so agitated!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nCome here. Do you see that letter? There, look\xe2\x80\x94you can see it through\r\nthe glass in the letter-box.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, I see it.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat letter is from Krogstad.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNora\xe2\x80\x94it was Krogstad who lent you the money!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, and now Torvald will know all about it.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBelieve me, Nora, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing for both of you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know all. I forged a name.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nGood heavens\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI only want to say this to you, Christine\xe2\x80\x94you must be my witness.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYour witness? What do you mean? What am I to\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIf I should go out of my mind\xe2\x80\x94and it might easily happen\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNora!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOr if anything else should happen to me\xe2\x80\x94anything, for instance, that\r\nmight prevent my being here\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNora! Nora! you are quite out of your mind.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd if it should happen that there were some one who wanted to take all\r\nthe responsibility, all the blame, you understand\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94but how can you suppose\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThen you must be my witness, that it is not true, Christine. I am not\r\nout of my mind at all; I am in my right senses now, and I tell you no\r\none else has known anything about it; I, and I alone, did the whole\r\nthing. Remember that.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI will, indeed. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand all this.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow should you understand it? A wonderful thing is going to happen!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nA wonderful thing?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, a wonderful thing!\xe2\x80\x94But it is so terrible, Christine; it mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhappen, not for all the world.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI will go at once and see Krogstad.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t go to him; he will do you some harm.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThere was a time when he would gladly do anything for my sake.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHe?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWhere does he live?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow should I know\xe2\x80\x94? Yes _[feeling in her pocket]_, here is his card.\r\nBut the letter, the letter\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[calls from his room, knocking at the door]_. Nora! Nora _[cries out\r\nanxiously]_. Oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s that? What do you want?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so frightened. We are not coming in; you have locked the door.\r\nAre you trying on your dress?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I look so nice, Torvald.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[who has read the card]_. I see he lives at the corner here.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no use. It is hopeless. The letter is lying there in the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nAnd your husband keeps the key?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, always.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nKrogstad must ask for his letter back unread, he must find some\r\npretence\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBut it is just at this time that Torvald generally\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou must delay him. Go in to him in the meantime. I will come back as\r\nsoon as I can. _[She goes out hurriedly through the hall door.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[goes to HELMER\xe2\x80\x99S door, opens it and peeps in]_. Torvald!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[from the inner room]_. Well? May I venture at last to come into my\r\nown room again? Come along, Rank, now you will see\xe2\x80\x94 _[Halting in the\r\ndoorway.]_ But what is this?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat is what, dear?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nRank led me to expect a splendid transformation.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[in the doorway]_. I understood so, but evidently I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, nobody is to have the chance of admiring me in my dress until\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut, my dear Nora, you look so worn out. Have you been practising too\r\nmuch?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I have not practised at all.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut you will need to\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on a bit without you to\r\nhelp me; I have absolutely forgotten the whole thing.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOh, we will soon work it up again.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, help me, Torvald. Promise that you will! I am so nervous about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94all the people\xe2\x80\x94. You must give yourself up to me entirely this\r\nevening. Not the tiniest bit of business\xe2\x80\x94you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t even take a pen in\r\nyour hand. Will you promise, Torvald dear?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nI promise. This evening I will be wholly and absolutely at your\r\nservice, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by the way, first of all I\r\nwill just\xe2\x80\x94 _[Goes towards the hall door.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat are you going to do there?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOnly see if any letters have come.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, no! don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, Torvald!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTorvald, please don\xe2\x80\x99t. There is nothing there.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell, let me look. _[Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at the piano,\r\nplays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the doorway.]_\r\nAha!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t dance tomorrow if I don\xe2\x80\x99t practise with you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[going up to her]_. Are you really so afraid of it, dear?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let me practise at once; there is time\r\nnow, before we go to dinner. Sit down and play for me, Torvald dear;\r\ncriticise me, and correct me as you play.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWith great pleasure, if you wish me to. _[Sits down at the piano.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl. She\r\nhastily drapes the shawl round her. Then she springs to the front of\r\nthe stage and calls out]_. Now play for me! I am going to dance!\r\n\r\n_[HELMER plays and NORA dances. RANK stands by the piano behind HELMER,\r\nand looks on.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[as he plays]_. Slower, slower!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t do it any other way.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNot so violently, Nora!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThis is the way.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[stops playing]_. No, no\xe2\x80\x94that is not a bit right.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[laughing and swinging the tambourine]_. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you so?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nLet me play for her.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[getting up]_. Yes, do. I can correct her better then.\r\n\r\n_[RANK sits down at the piano and plays. NORA dances more and more\r\nwildly. HELMER has taken up a position beside the stove, and during her\r\ndance gives her frequent instructions. She does not seem to hear him;\r\nher hair comes down and falls over her shoulders; she pays no attention\r\nto it, but goes on dancing. Enter Mrs Linde.]_\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[standing as if spell-bound in the doorway]_. Oh!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[as she dances]_. Such fun, Christine!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMy dear darling Nora, you are dancing as if your life depended on it.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSo it does.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nStop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you! _[RANK stops\r\nplaying, and NORA suddenly stands still. HELMER goes up to her.]_ I\r\ncould never have believed it. You have forgotten everything I taught\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[throwing away the tambourine]_. There, you see.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou will want a lot of coaching.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last\r\nminute. Promise me that, Torvald!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou can depend on me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou must not think of anything but me, either today or tomorrow; you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t open a single letter\xe2\x80\x94not even open the letter-box\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAh, you are still afraid of that fellow\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, indeed I am.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora, I can tell from your looks that there is a letter from him lying\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I think there is; but you must not read anything of that\r\nkind now. Nothing horrid must come between us until this is all over.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[whispers to HELMER]_. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t contradict her.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[taking her in his arms]_. The child shall have her way. But tomorrow\r\nnight, after you have danced\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThen you will be free. _[The MAID appears in the doorway to the\r\nright.]_\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nDinner is served, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWe will have champagne, Helen.\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\nVery good, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. [Exit.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHullo!\xe2\x80\x94are we going to have a banquet?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, a champagne banquet until the small hours. _[Calls out.]_ And a\r\nfew macaroons, Helen\xe2\x80\x94lots, just for once!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nCome, come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be so wild and nervous.

Christine,\r\nyou must help me to do up my hair.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[whispers to HELMER as they go out]_. I suppose there is nothing\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nis not expecting anything?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nFar from it, my dear fellow; it is simply nothing more than this\r\nchildish nervousness I was telling you of. _[They go into the\r\nright-hand room.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWell!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nGone out of town.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI could tell from your face.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nHe is coming home tomorrow evening.

The door into\r\nthe hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above.

She whispers.]_ Come in. There is no one here.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[in the doorway]_. I found a note from you at home. What does this\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIt is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nReally? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIt is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my\r\nrooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers\r\nare at the dance upstairs.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, why not?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nCertainly\xe2\x80\x94why not?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNow, Nils, let us have a talk.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nCan we two have anything to talk about?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWe have a great deal to talk about.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought so.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, you have never properly understood me.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWas there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x94a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance\r\nturns up?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nDo you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you\r\nbelieve that I did it with a light heart?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNils, did you really think that?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIf it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at the time?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it was my duty\r\nalso to put an end to all that you felt for me.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[wringing his hands]_. So that was it. And all this\xe2\x80\x94only for the sake\r\nof money!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two little\r\nbrothers. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed\r\nhopeless then.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nThat may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIndeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[more gently]_. When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground\r\nwent from under my feet. Look at me now\xe2\x80\x94I am a shipwrecked man clinging\r\nto a bit of wreckage.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nBut help may be near.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIt was near; but then you came and stood in my way.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nUnintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it was your\r\nplace I was going to take in the Bank.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not\r\ngoing to give it up to me?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, because that would not benefit you in the least.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nOh, benefit, benefit\xe2\x80\x94I would have done it whether or no.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI have learned to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter necessity have\r\ntaught me that.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAnd life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThen life has taught you something very reasonable. But deeds you must\r\nbelieve in?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI had good reason to say so.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWell, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some wreckage\xe2\x80\x94no one to\r\nmourn for, no one to care for.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIt was your own choice.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThere was no other choice\xe2\x80\x94then.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWell, what now?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could join forces?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWhat are you saying?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nTwo on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better chance than each\r\non their own.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nChristine I...\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWhat do you suppose brought me to town?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nDo you mean that you gave me a thought?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI could not endure life without work. All my life, as long as I can\r\nremember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and only pleasure.\r\nBut now I am quite alone in the world\xe2\x80\x94my life is so dreadfully empty\r\nand I feel so forsaken. There is not the least pleasure in working for\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self. Nils, give me someone and something to work for.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t trust that. It is nothing but a woman\xe2\x80\x99s overstrained sense of\r\ngenerosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nHave you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nCould you really do it? Tell me\xe2\x80\x94do you know all about my past life?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAnd do you know what they think of me here?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been quite\r\nanother man.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI am certain of it.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIs it too late now?\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nChristine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am sure you are. I\r\nsee it in your face. Have you really the courage, then\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI want to be a mother to someone, and your children need a mother. We\r\ntwo need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real character\xe2\x80\x94I can\r\ndare anything together with you.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[grasps her hands]_. Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find a way\r\nto clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[listening]_. Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nWhy? What is it?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nDo you hear them up there? When that is over, we may expect them back.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are not aware\r\nwhat steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, I know all about that.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAnd in spite of that have you the courage to\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nI understand very well to what lengths a man like you might be driven\r\nby despair.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nIf I could only undo what I have done!\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nAre you sure of that?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nQuite sure, but\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\n_[with a searching look at her]_. Is that what it all means?\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\nwant to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly. Is that it?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNils, a woman who has once sold herself for another\xe2\x80\x99s sake, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nit a second time.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI will ask for my letter back.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, no.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nYes, of course I will. I will wait here until Helmer comes; I will tell\r\nhim he must give me my letter back\xe2\x80\x94that it only concerns my\r\ndismissal\xe2\x80\x94that he is not to read it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNo, Nils, you must not recall your letter.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nBut, tell me, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it for that very purpose that you asked me to meet\r\nyou here?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nIn my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four hours have\r\nelapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed incredible things\r\nin this house. Helmer must know all about it. This unhappy secret must\r\nbe disclosed; they must have a complete understanding between them,\r\nwhich is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nVery well, if you will take the responsibility. But there is one thing\r\nI can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[listening]_. You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we are not\r\nsafe a moment longer.\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI will wait for you below.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, do. You must see me back to my door...\r\n\r\nKROGSTAD.\r\nI have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my life!\r\n_[Goes out through the outer door. The door between the room and the\r\nhall remains open.]_\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready]_. What a\r\ndifference! what a difference! Someone to work for and live for\xe2\x80\x94a home\r\nto bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they would be\r\nquick and come\xe2\x80\x94_[Listens.]_ Ah, there they are now. I must put on my\r\nthings. _[Takes up her hat and cloak. HELMER\xe2\x80\x99S and NORA\xe2\x80\x99S voices are\r\nheard outside; a key is turned, and HELMER brings NORA almost by force\r\ninto the hall. She is in an Italian costume with a large black shawl\r\naround her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is flying\r\nopen.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with him]_. No, no,\r\nno!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nleave so early.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut, my dearest Nora\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPlease, Torvald dear\xe2\x80\x94please, please\xe2\x80\x94only an hour more.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNot a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our agreement.\r\nCome along into the room; you are catching cold standing there. _[He\r\nbrings her gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.]_\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nGood evening.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nChristine!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou here, so late, Mrs Linde?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora in her dress.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHave you been sitting here waiting for me?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already gone upstairs; and\r\nI thought I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away again without having seen you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[taking off NORA\xe2\x80\x99S shawl]_. Yes, take a good look at her. I think she\r\nis worth looking at. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t she charming, Mrs Linde?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, indeed she is.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so at the dance.\r\nBut she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person. What are we\r\nto do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to bring her\r\naway by force.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTorvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it were only\r\nfor half an hour.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nListen to her, Mrs Linde! She had danced her Tarantella, and it had\r\nbeen a tremendous success, as it deserved\xe2\x80\x94although possibly the\r\nperformance was a trifle too realistic\xe2\x80\x94a little more so, I mean, than\r\nwas strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind\r\nabout that! The chief thing is, she had made a success\xe2\x80\x94she had made a\r\ntremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there\r\nafter that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little\r\nCapri maiden\xe2\x80\x94my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say\xe2\x80\x94on my arm;\r\ntook one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and, as\r\nthey say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit ought\r\nalways to be effective, Mrs Linde; but that is what I cannot make Nora\r\nunderstand. Pooh! this room is hot. _[Throws his domino on a chair, and\r\nopens the door of his room.]_ Hullo! it\xe2\x80\x99s all dark in here. Oh, of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94excuse me\xe2\x80\x94. _[He goes in, and lights some candles.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[in a hurried and breathless whisper]_. Well?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[in a low voice]_. I have had a talk with him.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, and\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nNora, you must tell your husband all about it.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[in an expressionless voice]_. I knew it.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYou have nothing to be afraid of as far as Krogstad is concerned; but\r\nyou must tell him.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nThen the letter will.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[coming in again]_. Well, Mrs Linde, have you admired her?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, and now I will say goodnight.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat, already? Is this yours, this knitting?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\n_[taking it]_. Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nSo you knit?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nOf course.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDo you know, you ought to embroider.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nReally? Why?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold the embroidery\r\nthus in your left hand, and use the needle with the right\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nYes, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut in the case of knitting\xe2\x80\x94that can never be anything but ungraceful;\r\nlook here\xe2\x80\x94the arms close together, the knitting-needles going up and\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x94it has a sort of Chinese effect\xe2\x80\x94. That was really excellent\r\nchampagne they gave us.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nWell,\xe2\x80\x94goodnight, Nora, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be self-willed any more.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, Mrs Linde.\r\n\r\nMRS LINDE.\r\nGoodnight, Mr. Helmer.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[accompanying her to the door]_. Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you will\r\nget home all right. I should be very happy to\xe2\x80\x94but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any great\r\ndistance to go. Goodnight, goodnight. _[She goes out; he shuts the door\r\nafter her, and comes in again.]_ Ah!\xe2\x80\x94at last we have got rid of her.\r\nShe is a frightful bore, that woman.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAren\xe2\x80\x99t you very tired, Torvald?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNo, not in the least.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNor sleepy?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNot a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily lively. And you?\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nreally look both tired and sleepy.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThere, you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay there any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nEverything you do is quite right, Torvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[kissing her on the forehead]_. Now my little skylark is speaking\r\nreasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nReally? Was he? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him at all.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd I very little, but I have not for a long time seen him in such good\r\nform. _[Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.]_ It is\r\ndelightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94you fascinating, charming little darling!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that, Torvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I look at my dearest treasure?\xe2\x80\x94at all the beauty that is\r\nmine, all my very own?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[going to the other side of the table]_. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say things like\r\nthat to me tonight.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[following her]_. You have still got the Tarantella in your blood, I\r\nsee. And it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen\xe2\x80\x94the guests are\r\nbeginning to go now. _[In a lower voice.]_ Nora\xe2\x80\x94soon the whole house\r\nwill be quiet.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I hope so.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a party with\r\nyou like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from you, and\r\nonly send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?\xe2\x80\x94do you know\r\nwhy I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we are\r\nsecretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that no\r\none suspects there is anything between us.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94I know very well your thoughts are with me all the time.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over your beautiful\r\nyoung shoulders\xe2\x80\x94on your lovely neck\xe2\x80\x94then I imagine that you are my\r\nyoung bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and I am\r\nbringing you for the first time into our home\xe2\x80\x94to be alone with you for\r\nthe first time\xe2\x80\x94quite alone with my shy little darling! All this evening\r\nI have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive figures\r\nof the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer,\r\nand that was why I brought you down so early\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nGo away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that? You\xe2\x80\x99re joking, my little Nora! You won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94you won\xe2\x80\x99t? Am I\r\nnot your husband\xe2\x80\x94? _[A knock is heard at the outer door.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[starting]_. Did you hear\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[going into the hall]_. Who is it?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[outside]_. It is I. May I come in for a moment?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[in a fretful whisper]_. Oh, what does he want now? _[Aloud.]_ Wait a\r\nminute! _[Unlocks the door.]_ Come, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of you not to pass by\r\nour door.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nI thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like to look in.\r\n_[With a swift glance round.]_ Ah, yes!\xe2\x80\x94these dear familiar rooms. You\r\nare very happy and cosy in here, you two.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIt seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well upstairs too.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nExcellently. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one enjoy everything in\r\nthis world?\xe2\x80\x94at any rate as much as one can, and as long as one can. The\r\nwine was capital\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nEspecially the champagne.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nSo you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I managed to\r\nput away!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTorvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight too.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nDid he?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWell, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well-spent day?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell spent? I am afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t take credit for that.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[clapping him on the back]_. But I can, you know!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDoctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some scientific\r\ninvestigation today.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nJust listen!\xe2\x80\x94little Nora talking about scientific investigations!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd may I congratulate you on the result?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nIndeed you may.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWas it favourable, then?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThe best possible, for both doctor and patient\xe2\x80\x94certainty.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[quickly and searchingly]_. Certainty?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nAbsolute certainty. So wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I entitled to make a merry evening of it\r\nafter that?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nI think so too, so long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for it in the morning.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nOh well, one can\xe2\x80\x99t have anything in this life without paying for it.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDoctor Rank\xe2\x80\x94are you fond of fancy-dress balls?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTell me\xe2\x80\x94what shall we two wear at the next?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nLittle featherbrain!\xe2\x80\x94are you thinking of the next already?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nWe two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nLet your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat was really very prettily turned. But can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us what you\r\nwill be?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about that.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWell?\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nAt the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good joke!\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThere is a big black hat\xe2\x80\x94have you never heard of hats that make you\r\ninvisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[suppressing a smile]_. Yes, you are quite right.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nBut I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a cigar\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nof the dark Havanas.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWith the greatest pleasure. _[Offers him his case.]_\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\n_[takes a cigar and cuts off the end]_. Thanks.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[striking a match]_. Let me give you a light.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThank you. _[She holds the match for him to light his cigar.]_ And now\r\ngoodbye!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nGoodbye, goodbye, dear old man!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSleep well, Doctor Rank.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nThank you for that wish.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWish me the same.\r\n\r\nRANK.\r\nYou? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the light. _[He\r\nnods to them both and goes out.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[in a subdued voice]_. He has drunk more than he ought.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[absently]_. Maybe. _[HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket\r\nand goes into the hall.]_ Torvald! what are you going to do there?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nEmptying the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room to put\r\nthe newspaper in tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAre you going to work tonight?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou know quite well I\xe2\x80\x99m not. What is this? Someone has been at the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAt the lock\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have thought the\r\nmaid\xe2\x80\x94. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[quickly]_. Then it must have been the children\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThen you must get them out of those ways. There, at last I have got it\r\nopen. _[Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the\r\nkitchen.]_ Helen!\xe2\x80\x94Helen, put out the light over the front door. _[Goes\r\nback into the room and shuts the door into the hall. He holds out his\r\nhand full of letters.]_ Look at that\xe2\x80\x94look what a heap of them there\r\nare. _[Turning them over.]_ What on earth is that?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[at the window]_. The letter\xe2\x80\x94No! Torvald, no!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nTwo cards\xe2\x80\x94of Rank\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nOf Doctor Rank\xe2\x80\x99s?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[looking at them]_. Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must have\r\nput them in when he went out.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIs there anything written on them?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThere is a black cross over the name. Look there\xe2\x80\x94what an uncomfortable\r\nidea! It looks as if he were announcing his own death.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt is just what he is doing.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything to you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his leave-taking\r\nfrom us. He means to shut himself up and die.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMy poor old friend! Certainly I knew we should not have him very long\r\nwith us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a wounded\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIf it has to happen, it is best it should be without a word\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink so, Torvald?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[walking up and down]_. He had so grown into our lives. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nof him as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his\r\nloneliness, was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well,\r\nperhaps it is best so. For him, anyway. _[Standing still.]_ And perhaps\r\nfor us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now. _[Puts\r\nhis arms round her.]_ My darling wife, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I could hold\r\nyou tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might\r\nbe threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood, and everything, for your sake.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly]_. Now you must\r\nread your letters, Torvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNo, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWith the thought of your friend\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has come between\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and rid our minds\r\nof that. Until then\xe2\x80\x94we will each go to our own room.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[hanging on his neck]_. Goodnight, Torvald\xe2\x80\x94Goodnight!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[kissing her on the forehead]_. Goodnight, my little singing-bird.\r\nSleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through. _[He takes his\r\nletters and goes into his room, shutting the door after him.]_\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[gropes distractedly about, seizes HELMER\xe2\x80\x99S domino, throws it round\r\nher, while she says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers]_. Never to\r\nsee him again. Never! Never! _[Puts her shawl over her head.]_ Never to\r\nsee my children again either\xe2\x80\x94never again. Never! Never!\xe2\x80\x94Ah! the icy,\r\nblack water\xe2\x80\x94the unfathomable depths\xe2\x80\x94If only it were over! He has got it\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children! _[She is\r\nabout to rush out through the hall, when HELMER opens his door\r\nhurriedly and stands with an open letter in his hand.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAh!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat is this? Do you know what is in this letter?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, I know. Let me go! Let me get out!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[holding her back]_. Where are you going?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[trying to get free]_. You shan\xe2\x80\x99t save me, Torvald!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[reeling]_. True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No, no\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nis impossible that it can be true.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us have any silly excuses.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[taking a step towards him]_. Torvald\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMiserable creature\xe2\x80\x94what have you done?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nLet me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not take it upon\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNo tragic airs, please. _[Locks the hall door.]_ Here you shall stay\r\nand give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done?\r\nAnswer me! Do you understand what you have done?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her\r\nface]_. Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[walking about the room]_. What a horrible awakening! All these eight\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94she who was my joy and pride\xe2\x80\x94a hypocrite, a liar\xe2\x80\x94worse, worse\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncriminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!\xe2\x80\x94For shame! For shame!\r\n_[NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He stops in front of her.]_\r\nI ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen. I\r\nought to have foreseen it. All your father\xe2\x80\x99s want of principle\xe2\x80\x94be\r\nsilent!\xe2\x80\x94all your father\xe2\x80\x99s want of principle has come out in you. No\r\nreligion, no morality, no sense of duty\xe2\x80\x94. How I am punished for having\r\nwinked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how you\r\nrepay me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s just it.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNow you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined all my future.\r\nIt is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an unscrupulous man;\r\nhe can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes of me, give me\r\nany orders he pleases\xe2\x80\x94I dare not refuse. And I must sink to such\r\nmiserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhen I am out of the way, you will be free.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNo fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty of those ready,\r\ntoo. What good would it be to me if you were out of the way, as you\r\nsay? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known everywhere; and if\r\nhe does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your\r\ncriminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nit was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwhom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you\r\nunderstand now what it is you have done for me?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[coldly and quietly]_. Yes.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIt is so incredible that I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it in. But we must come to some\r\nunderstanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must try\r\nand appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at\r\nany cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything\r\nbetween us were just as before\xe2\x80\x94but naturally only in the eyes of the\r\nworld. You will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course.\r\nBut I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust\r\nthem to you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to one whom I\r\nhave loved so dearly, and whom I still\xe2\x80\x94. No, that is all over. From\r\nthis moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to\r\nsave the remains, the fragments, the appearance\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_[A ring is heard at the front-door bell.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[with a start]_. What is that? So late! Can the worst\xe2\x80\x94? Can he\xe2\x80\x94? Hide\r\nyourself, Nora. Say you are ill.\r\n\r\n_[NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and unlocks the hall door.]_\r\n\r\nMAID.\r\n_[half-dressed, comes to the door]_. A letter for the mistress.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nGive it to me. _[Takes the letter, and shuts the door.]_ Yes, it is\r\nfrom him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, read it.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[standing by the lamp]_. I scarcely have the courage to do it. It may\r\nmean ruin for both of us. No, I must know. _[Tears open the letter,\r\nruns his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed, and gives a\r\nshout of joy.]_ Nora! _[She looks at him questioningly.]_ Nora!\xe2\x80\x94No, I\r\nmust read it once again\xe2\x80\x94. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am\r\nsaved!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd I?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou too, of course; we are both saved, both you and I. Look, he sends\r\nyou your bond back. He says he regrets and repents\xe2\x80\x94that a happy change\r\nin his life\xe2\x80\x94never mind what he says! We are saved, Nora! No one can do\r\nanything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!\xe2\x80\x94no, first I must destroy these hateful\r\nthings. Let me see\xe2\x80\x94. _[Takes a look at the bond.]_ No, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nat it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to me. _[Tears\r\nup the bond and both letters, throws them all into the stove, and\r\nwatches them burn.]_ There\xe2\x80\x94now it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist any longer. He says\r\nthat since Christmas Eve you\xe2\x80\x94. These must have been three dreadful days\r\nfor you, Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI have fought a hard fight these three days.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd suffered agonies, and seen no way out but\xe2\x80\x94. No, we won\xe2\x80\x99t call any\r\nof the horrors to mind. We will only shout with joy, and keep saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over! It\xe2\x80\x99s all over!\xe2\x80\x9d Listen to me, Nora. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\r\nrealise that it is all over. What is this?\xe2\x80\x94such a cold, set face! My\r\npoor little Nora, I quite understand; you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if you could\r\nbelieve that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I swear it; I\r\nhave forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you did out of\r\nlove for me.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat is true.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband. Only you had not\r\nsufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used. But do you suppose\r\nyou are any the less dear to me, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how to\r\nact on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on me; I will advise\r\nyou and direct you. I should not be a man if this womanly helplessness\r\ndid not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes. You must not\r\nthink anymore about the hard things I said in my first moment of\r\nconsternation, when I thought everything was going to overwhelm me. I\r\nhave forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have forgiven you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThank you for your forgiveness. _[She goes out through the door to the\r\nright.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t go\xe2\x80\x94. _[Looks in.]_ What are you doing in there?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[from within]_. Taking off my fancy dress.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[standing at the open door]_. Yes, do. Try and calm yourself, and make\r\nyour mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at rest,\r\nand feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. _[Walks up\r\nand down by the door.]_ How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is\r\nshelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have\r\nsaved from a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating\r\nheart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow\r\nmorning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything\r\nwill be just as it was before. Very soon you won\xe2\x80\x99t need me to assure\r\nyou that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that\r\nI have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as\r\nrepudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet\r\nand satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that\r\nhad made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life,\r\nso to speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So\r\nyou shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling.\r\nHave no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me,\r\nand I will serve as will and conscience both to you\xe2\x80\x94. What is this? Not\r\ngone to bed? Have you changed your things?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[in everyday dress]_. Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things now.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut what for?\xe2\x80\x94so late as this.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI shall not sleep tonight.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut, my dear Nora\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[looking at her watch]_. It is not so very late. Sit down here,\r\nTorvald. You and I have much to say to one another. _[She sits down at\r\none side of the table.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora\xe2\x80\x94what is this?\xe2\x80\x94this cold, set face?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nSit down. It will take some time; I have a lot to talk over with you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[sits down at the opposite side of the table]_. You alarm me,\r\nNora!\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, that is just it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me, and I have never\r\nunderstood you either\xe2\x80\x94before tonight. No, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me. You\r\nmust simply listen to what I say. Torvald, this is a settling of\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[after a short silence]_. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there one thing that strikes you as\r\nstrange in our sitting here like this?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWe have been married now eight years. Does it not occur to you that\r\nthis is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife, have had a\r\nserious conversation?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat do you mean by serious?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIn all these eight years\xe2\x80\x94longer than that\xe2\x80\x94from the very beginning of\r\nour acquaintance, we have never exchanged a word on any serious\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWas it likely that I would be continually and forever telling you about\r\nworries that you could not help me to bear?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am not speaking about business matters. I say that we have never sat\r\ndown in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut, dearest Nora, would it have been any good to you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat is just it; you have never understood me. I have been greatly\r\nwronged, Torvald\xe2\x80\x94first by papa and then by you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat! By us two\xe2\x80\x94by us two, who have loved you better than anyone else\r\nin the world?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[shaking her head]_. You have never loved me. You have only thought it\r\npleasant to be in love with me.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora, what do I hear you saying?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with papa, he told me\r\nhis opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinions; and if I\r\ndiffered from him I concealed the fact, because he would not have liked\r\nit. He called me his doll-child, and he played with me just as I used\r\nto play with my dolls. And when I came to live with you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[undisturbed]_. I mean that I was simply transferred from papa\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\ninto yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste, and so\r\nI got the same tastes as you\xe2\x80\x94or else I pretended to, I am really not\r\nquite sure which\xe2\x80\x94I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other.\r\nWhen I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here\r\nlike a poor woman\xe2\x80\x94just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to\r\nperform tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa\r\nhave committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have\r\nmade nothing of my life.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHow unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you not been\r\nhappy here?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never really\r\nbeen so.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNot\xe2\x80\x94not happy!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our home\r\nhas been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just as at\r\nhome I was papa\xe2\x80\x99s doll-child; and here the children have been my dolls.\r\nI thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they thought it\r\ngreat fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage has been,\r\nTorvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThere is some truth in what you say\xe2\x80\x94exaggerated and strained as your\r\nview of it is. But for the future it shall be different. Playtime shall\r\nbe over, and lesson-time shall begin.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhose lessons? Mine, or the children\xe2\x80\x99s?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBoth yours and the children\xe2\x80\x99s, my darling Nora.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAlas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being a proper\r\nwife for you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd you can say that!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x94how am I fitted to bring up the children?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so yourself a little while ago\xe2\x80\x94that you dare not trust\r\nme to bring them up?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIn a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIndeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task. There is\r\nanother task I must undertake first. I must try and educate myself\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nare not the man to help me in that. I must do that for myself. And that\r\nis why I am going to leave you now.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[springing up]_. What do you say?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and everything\r\nabout me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora, Nora!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am going away from here now, at once. I am sure Christine will take\r\nme in for the night\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou are out of your mind! I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow it! I forbid you!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with me\r\nwhat belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat sort of madness is this!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nTomorrow I shall go home\xe2\x80\x94I mean, to my old home. It will be easiest for\r\nme to find something to do there.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou blind, foolish woman!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI must try and get some sense, Torvald.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nTo desert your home, your husband and your children! And you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconsider what people will say!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI cannot consider that at all. I only know that it is necessary for me.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s shocking. This is how you would neglect your most sacred duties.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat do you consider my most sacred duties?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nDo I need to tell you that? Are they not your duties to your husband\r\nand your children?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI have other duties just as sacred.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat you have not. What duties could those be?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nDuties to myself.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBefore all else, you are a wife and a mother.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that any longer. I believe that before all else I am a\r\nreasonable human being, just as you are\xe2\x80\x94or, at all events, that I must\r\ntry and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people would\r\nthink you right, and that views of that kind are to be found in books;\r\nbut I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or with\r\nwhat is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get to\r\nunderstand them.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nCan you not understand your place in your own home? Have you not a\r\nreliable guide in such matters as that?\xe2\x80\x94have you no religion?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nWhat are you saying?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be\r\nconfirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other.\r\nWhen I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that\r\nmatter too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all\r\nevents if it is true for me.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThis is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion cannot lead\r\nyou aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose you have\r\nsome moral sense? Or\xe2\x80\x94answer me\xe2\x80\x94am I to think you have none?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to answer. I really\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that you and\r\nI look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too, that the\r\nlaw is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it\r\nimpossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it a\r\nwoman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s life. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou talk like a child. You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the conditions of the world\r\nin which you live.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I can make\r\nout who is right, the world or I.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are out of\r\nyour mind.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your husband\r\nand your children?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, it is.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThen there is only one possible explanation.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYou do not love me anymore.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo, that is just it.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora!\xe2\x80\x94and you can say that?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been so kind to\r\nme, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[regaining his composure]_. Is that a clear and certain conviction\r\ntoo?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, absolutely clear and certain. That is the reason why I will not\r\nstay here any longer.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAnd can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYes, indeed I can. It was tonight, when the wonderful thing did not\r\nhappen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you were.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nExplain yourself better. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness knows, I knew\r\nvery well that wonderful things don\xe2\x80\x99t happen every day. Then this\r\nhorrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite certain that\r\nthe wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nwas lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would\r\nconsent to accept this man\xe2\x80\x99s conditions. I was so absolutely certain\r\nthat you would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And\r\nwhen that was done\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nYes, what then?\xe2\x80\x94when I had exposed my wife to shame and disgrace?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nWhen that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would come forward\r\nand take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nYou mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your\r\npart? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been worth\r\nagainst yours? That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and\r\nfeared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to kill myself.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nI would gladly work night and day for you, Nora\xe2\x80\x94bear sorrow and want\r\nfor your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he\r\nloves.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nIt is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nOh, you think and talk like a heedless child.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nMaybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind myself\r\nto. As soon as your fear was over\xe2\x80\x94and it was not fear for what\r\nthreatened me, but for what might happen to you\xe2\x80\x94when the whole thing\r\nwas past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at\r\nall had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your\r\ndoll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care, because\r\nit was so brittle and fragile. _[Getting up.]_ Torvald\xe2\x80\x94it was then it\r\ndawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a\r\nstrange man, and had borne him three children\xe2\x80\x94. Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to\r\nthink of it! I could tear myself into little bits!\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[sadly]_. I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us\xe2\x80\x94there is no\r\ndenying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nAs I am now, I am no wife for you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nI have it in me to become a different man.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94if your doll is taken away from you.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut to part!\xe2\x80\x94to part from you! No, no, Nora, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand that\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[going out to the right]_. That makes it all the more certain that it\r\nmust be done. _[She comes back with her cloak and hat and a small bag\r\nwhich she puts on a chair by the table.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora, Nora, not now! Wait until tomorrow.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[putting on her cloak]_. I cannot spend the night in a strange man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut can\xe2\x80\x99t we live here like brother and sister\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[putting on her hat]_. You know very well that would not last long.\r\n_[Puts the shawl round her.]_ Goodbye, Torvald. I won\xe2\x80\x99t see the little\r\nones. I know they are in better hands than mine. As I am now, I can be\r\nof no use to them.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut some day, Nora\xe2\x80\x94some day?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nHow can I tell? I have no idea what is going to become of me.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut you are my wife, whatever becomes of you.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nListen, Torvald. I have heard that when a wife deserts her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all obligations\r\ntowards her. In any case, I set you free from all your obligations. You\r\nare not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way, any more than I\r\nshall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. See, here is your\r\nring back. Give me mine.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nThat too?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat too.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nHere it is.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. Now it is all over. I have put the keys here. The maids\r\nknow all about everything in the house\xe2\x80\x94better than I do. Tomorrow,\r\nafter I have left her, Christine will come here and pack up my own\r\nthings that I brought with me from home. I will have them sent after\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nAll over! All over!\xe2\x80\x94Nora, shall you never think of me again?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nI know I shall often think of you, the children, and this house.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nMay I write to you, Nora?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94never. You must not do that.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut at least let me send you\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nLet me help you if you are in want.\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nNo. I can receive nothing from a stranger.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nNora\xe2\x80\x94can I never be anything more than a stranger to you?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\n_[taking her bag]_. Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful thing of all would\r\nhave to happen.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nTell me what that would be!\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nBoth you and I would have to be so changed that\xe2\x80\x94. Oh, Torvald, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve any longer in wonderful things happening.\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\nBut I will believe in it. Tell me! So changed that\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\nNORA.\r\nThat our life together would be a real wedlock. Goodbye. _[She goes out\r\nthrough the hall.]_\r\n\r\nHELMER.\r\n_[sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands]_.\r\nNora! Nora! _[Looks round, and rises.]_ Empty. She is gone. _[A hope\r\nflashes across his mind.]_ The most wonderful thing of all\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n_[The sound of a door shutting is heard from below.]_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Doll\xe2\x80\x99s House, by Henrik Ibsen\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A DOLL\xe2\x80\x99S HOUSE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2542-0.txt or 2542-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/4/2542/\r\n\r\nProduced by Martin Adamson, and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.

Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
