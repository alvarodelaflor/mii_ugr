Would you not like to read about your own country, and to know\r\nwhat sort of people lived in it a long while ago, and whether they\r\nwere any thing like us? Indeed, they were not; neither was England,\r\nin ancient times, such as it is now.\r\n\r\n2. There were no great cities, no fine buildings, no pleasant\r\ngardens, parks, or nice roads to go from one place to another; but\r\nthe people lived in caves, or in the woods, in clusters of huts,\r\nwhich they called towns.\r\n\r\n3. The country was not then called England, but Britain; and its\r\ninhabitants were called Britons. They were divided into many tribes;\r\nand each tribe had a king or chief, like the North American Indians;\r\nand these chiefs often went to war with one another.\r\n\r\n4. Some of the tribes lived like savages, for they had no clothes but\r\nskins, and did not know how to cultivate the land: so they had no\r\nbread, but got food to eat by hunting animals in the forests, fishing\r\nin the rivers, and some of them by keeping herds of small hardy\r\ncattle, and gathering wild roots and acorns, which they roasted and\r\neat.\r\n\r\n5. But all the Britons were not equally uncivilized, for those who\r\ndwelt on the south coasts of the island, had learned many useful\r\nthings from the Gauls, a people then living in the country now called\r\nFrance, who used to come over to trade with them, and with many\r\nfamilies of Gauls who had at various times settled amongst them.\r\n\r\n6. They grew corn, brewed ale, made butter and cheese, and a coarse\r\nwoollen cloth for their clothing. And they knew how to dye the wool\r\nof several colors, for they wore plaid trowsers and tunics, and dark\r\ncolored woollen mantles, in shape like a large open shawl.\r\n\r\n7. Perhaps you would like to know what they had to sell to the Gauls;\r\nso I will tell you. Britain was famous for large dogs; and there\r\nwas plenty of tin; and the South Britons sold also corn and cattle,\r\nand the prisoners which had been taken in war, who were bought for\r\nslaves; and you will be sorry to hear that many of the ancient\r\nBritons sold their children into slavery.\r\n\r\n8. They carried these goods in carts, drawn by oxen, to the coast of\r\nHampshire, then crossed over to the Isle of Wight, in light boats,\r\nmade of wicker, and covered with hides or skins, in shape something\r\nlike half a walnut shell.\r\n\r\n9. The merchants from Gaul met them in the Isle of Wight; and as they\r\nbrought different kinds of merchandise to dispose of, they managed\r\ntheir business almost entirely without money, by exchanging one thing\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\n10. The Britons were very clever in making things of wicker work, in\r\nthe form of baskets, shields, coated with hides, boats, and chariots,\r\nwith flat wooden wheels.\r\n\r\n11. These chariots were used in war, and sharp scythes were fixed\r\nto the axles of the wheels, which made terrible havoc when driven\r\nthrough a body of enemies.\r\n\r\n12. But I shall not say much about the wars of the ancient Britons,\r\nor their mode of fighting; as there are many things far more pleasant\r\nto read of, and more useful to know.\r\n\r\n13. At that time, which is about one thousand nine hundred years ago,\r\nthe country was almost covered with forests; and when the people\r\nwanted to build a town, they cleared a space for it by cutting down\r\nthe trees, and then built a number of round huts of branches and\r\nclay, with high pointed roofs, like an extinguisher, covered with\r\nrushes or reeds.\r\n\r\n14. This was called a town; and around it they made a bank of earth,\r\nand a fence of the trees they had felled; outside the fence, they\r\nalso dug a ditch, to protect themselves and their cattle from the\r\nsudden attacks of hostile tribes.\r\n\r\n15. As to furniture, a few stools or blocks of wood to sit upon,\r\nsome wooden bowls and wicker baskets to hold their food, with a few\r\njars and pans of coarse earthenware, were all the things they used;\r\nfor they slept on the ground on skins, spread upon dried leaves, and\r\nfern, or heath. Their bows and arrows, shields, spears, and other\r\nweapons, were hung round the insides of their huts.\r\n\r\n16. The Britons were not quite ignorant of the art of working in\r\nmetals; for there was a class of men living among them who understood\r\nmany useful arts, and were learned, too, for those times, although\r\nthey did not communicate their learning to the rest of the people.\r\n\r\n17. These men were the Druids, or priests, who had much more\r\nauthority than the chiefs, because they were so much cleverer;\r\ntherefore the people minded what they said.\r\n\r\n18. They made all the laws, and held courts of justice in the open\r\nair, when they must have made a very venerable appearance, seated in\r\na circle on stones, dressed in long white woollen robes, with wands\r\nin their hands, and long beards descending below their girdles.\r\n\r\n19. The ignorant people believed they were magicians, for they knew\r\nsomething of astronomy, and of the medicinal qualities of plants and\r\nherbs, with which they made medicines to give the sick, who always\r\nthought they were cured by magic.\r\n\r\n20. Some of the Druids were bards, that is poets, and musicians;\r\nothers taught young men to become Druids; and some of them made a\r\ngreat many useful things out of the metals that were found in the\r\nmines.\r\n\r\n21. You will perhaps wonder where the Druids gained all their\r\nknowledge. I cannot tell you; but many learned men think that the\r\nfirst Druids came from India or Persia, as the religion they taught\r\nwas very similar to that of the Persians and Hindoos.\r\n\r\n22. They did not believe in the true God, but told the people there\r\nwere many gods, and that they were in trees and rivers, and fire,\r\nwhich they worshipped for that reason.\r\n\r\n23. They had no churches, but made temples, by forming circles of\r\nlarge stones, of such immense size that nobody can guess how they\r\nwere carried to the places where they stood, for there are some of\r\nthem still remaining.\r\n\r\n24. They used to hold several religious festivals in the course of\r\nthe year, when all the people made holiday, and the bards played on\r\ntheir harps and sang, and there was plenty of feasting, and merry\r\nmaking; and they used to light bonfires, and make an illumination by\r\nrunning about with torches in their hands, for they believed that a\r\ndisplay of fire was pleasing to their gods; and so you see that our\r\ncustom of having fireworks, and illuminations, and bonfires, on days\r\nof public rejoicing, is as old as the time of the ancient Britons.\r\n\r\n25. The Druids had a great deal to do on those days; for they used\r\nto go to their temples and say prayers, and sacrifice animals for\r\nofferings to their false gods; and on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, they walked in\r\nprocession to some old oak tree to cut the mistletoe that grew upon\r\nit, for this was one of their religious ceremonies; and the oldest\r\nDruid went up into the tree to cut the plant, while the rest stood\r\nbelow singing sacred songs, and holding their robes to catch the\r\nboughs as they fell; and crowds of men and women stood round to see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n26. But I must make an end of this chapter about the ancient Britons,\r\nand tell you how the Romans came and conquered the country, and made\r\nquite a different place of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  3.

The Romans, about the time of the birth of Christ, were the\r\nrichest, the most powerful, and the cleverest people in the world.\r\nRome was a grand city, and there were many other fine cities in Italy\r\nbelonging to the Romans, who knew how to build handsome houses, and\r\nmake beautiful gardens, besides being excellent farmers.\r\n\r\n2. They had elegant furniture, and pictures, and marble statues; and\r\nthey were well educated, and wrote a great number of books in Latin,\r\nfor that was their language, and many of those books are used in our\r\nschools to this day.\r\n\r\n3. They had large armies, and had conquered a great many countries,\r\nwhen Julius C\xc3\xa6sar, a great Roman General, brought an army to Britain,\r\nabout fifty years before the birth of our Saviour, to try to conquer\r\nthe Britons also; but thousands of British warriors went down to\r\nthe sea shore, by Dover cliffs, to fight the Romans as soon as they\r\nlanded; and they took a great many war chariots with them, and fought\r\nso bravely, that after two or three battles, C\xc3\xa6sar offered to make\r\npeace with them, and go away, if their princes would pay tribute to\r\nthe Roman government; which they consented to do.\r\n\r\n4. However, the Romans thought no more about Britain for nearly a\r\nhundred years, when they came again, and went to war in earnest\r\nwith the natives, who at length were obliged to submit to them; and\r\nBritain became a part of the Roman Empire, just as India is at this\r\ntime a part of the British Empire.\r\n\r\n5. Now this was a good thing for the Britons, although they did not\r\nthen think so; for as soon as they left off fighting, the Romans\r\nbegan to teach them all they knew, and to make a much better place\r\nof Britain than it had ever been before.\r\n\r\n6. As soon as a part of the country was conquered, some great man was\r\nsent from Rome to govern it, and to make the people obey the Roman\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n7. Then other great men came to live here, and brought their families\r\nand furniture and plate from Rome; and built fine houses, and planted\r\ngardens, with flowers and fruit trees, and vegetables, that were\r\nnever seen here before, for they brought the roots and seeds and\r\nyoung trees with them.\r\n\r\n8. At first, the Roman governors made the Britons pay very heavy\r\ntaxes; not in money, for they had none; but they were obliged to give\r\na part of their cattle, and corn, and metals, or any thing else they\r\nhad; and to work with the Roman soldiers at building, making roads,\r\ndraining the watery lands, and cutting down trees, to make room for\r\nhouses and gardens.\r\n\r\n9. They did not like this, and one of the tribes, named the Iceni,\r\nwho lived in that part of Britain which is now called Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk, determined to make another effort to drive the Romans out of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n10. You will be surprised to hear that they were headed by a woman;\r\nbut there were queens among the Britons as well as kings; and the\r\nking of the Iceni being dead, his widow Boadicea governed in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n11. She encouraged her people to rebel against their new rulers, and\r\nled them to battle herself, mounted in a chariot, and armed like a\r\nwarrior; but the Romans won the battle, and the brave but unfortunate\r\nqueen put an end to her own life.\r\n\r\n12. After this, there was another long war, which lasted till all\r\nthe South British tribes were subdued, and the Roman government\r\nestablished all over the country, except the north part of Scotland.\r\n\r\n13. It was lucky for the Britons that a very good Roman, named\r\nAgricola, was made governor about this time, for he behaved so kindly\r\nthat they began to like the Romans, and to wish to live as they did,\r\nand to know how to do all the clever things they could do.\r\n\r\n14. I should tell you that all the Roman soldiers were educated as\r\nengineers and builders, surveyors, and cultivators of land, and when\r\nnot actually engaged in fighting, they were employed daily for four\r\nhours in some such out-of-door labour or occupation; so, when the\r\nwar was over, they were set to work to improve the country, and the\r\nBritons had to help them.\r\n\r\n15. They made good hard broad roads, paved with stones firmly\r\ncemented together, and set up mile stones upon them.\r\n\r\n16. The Romans had built London during the war, and given it the name\r\nof Augusta, but the houses were almost all barracks for the soldiers\r\nand their families, so that it was not nearly so handsome as York\r\nand Bath, and many other cities that they built in place of the old\r\nBritish towns.\r\n\r\n17. The Britons, who had never seen any thing better than their\r\nown clay huts, must have been quite astonished at the fine houses\r\nconstructed by the Romans; who also built, in every city, temples,\r\ntheatres, and public baths, with large rooms for people to meet in,\r\nlike a coffee house.\r\n\r\n18. Then, in each town, was a market place for people to buy and sell\r\ngoods, and the Romans taught the Britons generally to use money,\r\nwhich was more convenient than taking things in exchange.\r\n\r\n19. The Romans were excellent farmers, as I said before; so they\r\nshewed the natives how to manage their land better than they had\r\ndone, and how to make many useful implements of husbandry.\r\n\r\n20. By cutting down the forest trees, which they used in building,\r\nthey obtained more land for cultivation, and grew so much corn that\r\nthere was more than enough for the people in Britain, so that a great\r\ndeal was sent every year to the Roman colonies in Germany.\r\n\r\n21. By degrees, the Britons left off their old habits, and those\r\nabove the lowest rank wore the Roman dress, spoke the Roman language,\r\nand adopted the manners and customs of their conquerors, who treated\r\nthem as friends and equals.\r\n\r\n22. There were schools opened in all the towns, where British and\r\nRoman boys were instructed together, and the former were all brought\r\nup to serve in the Roman armies; for there were no more wars among\r\nthe British princes; who held the same rank as before, but paid\r\ntribute to the Roman governor, and were under his authority, as many\r\nof the princes of India are now under the authority of the English\r\nGovernor General in India.\r\n\r\n23. The Britons had to pay a great many taxes, but they likewise\r\nenjoyed many rights, for the Roman laws were much better laws than\r\nthose of the Druids, which were made for barbarians, and not for\r\ncivilized people, such as the Britons had now become.\r\n\r\n24. You will, perhaps, wonder what the Druids were about all this\r\ntime. The Romans did not approve of their religion, so they put an\r\nend to it very soon, after they came here; but what became of the\r\nDruids, is not exactly known.\r\n\r\n25. It is supposed that many of them were killed by the Romans in the\r\nisle of Anglesea, where the chief Druid always resided; and that all\r\nthe rest fled to Scotland, or the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n26. The Romans, however, were themselves heathens, when they first\r\nsettled in Britain, and worshipped a number of false gods; but their\r\ngods were different from those of the Druids, and the rites and\r\nceremonies of their religion were different too.\r\n\r\n27. But, in course of time, many of the Romans became Christians, and\r\nChristianity was taught in Britain, where the heathen temples were\r\nconverted into Christian churches, and the Britons, as well as the\r\nRomans, at length learned to worship the one true God.\r\n\r\n28. The Romans had kept possession of Britain for more than three\r\nhundred years, when it happened that great armies of barbarians went\r\nto fight against Rome, and all the soldiers were sent for, to try to\r\ndrive them away again; so that this country was left unprotected, for\r\nit was the Roman soldiers who had kept enemies from coming here.\r\n\r\n29. The Britons hoped they would come back again, as they did more\r\nthan once; but affairs got worse and worse at Rome, so the rulers\r\nthere sent word to the British princes, that they did not wish to\r\nkeep the island any longer, therefore the Britons might consider\r\nthemselves a free people. But was freedom a blessing to them? I think\r\nwe shall find it was not.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  3. By whom was Britain first invaded?\r\n\r\n  4. When did the Romans again appear?\r\n\r\n  5. Was this conquest a good or bad thing for the Britons, and why?\r\n\r\n  8. What occasioned the revolt of the Iceni?\r\n\r\n  10. Who headed the insurrection, and what were its consequences?\r\n\r\n  13. Who was Agricola?\r\n\r\n  14. How were the Roman soldiers employed in time of peace?\r\n\r\n  15. Tell me of the improvements made in Britain by the Romans.\r\n\r\n  25. What became of the Druids?\r\n\r\n  28. When and why did the Romans leave Britain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE SAXON HEPTARCHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SAXON SHIP.]\r\n\r\n1. It is now time to tell you something about the Picts and Scots.\r\nThey were the people of Scotland, and were called by the Romans\r\nCaledonians, which meant men of the woods, because they were very\r\nrude and fierce, and lived among woods and wilds.\r\n\r\n2. They had always been sad enemies to the Britons; but the Romans\r\nhad kept them away, and the good governor Agricola built a row of\r\nstrong forts, all across their country, and placed soldiers in them,\r\nto make the Caledonians keep on the other side.\r\n\r\n3. However, they sometimes managed to break through; so the Emperor\r\nSeverus, who was here from the year 207 to 211, had a stone wall\r\nbuilt across that narrow part, where Northumberland joins Cumberland,\r\nand it was so strong, that parts of the banks and forts are still\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\n4. But when all the Roman soldiers were gone, the Picts and Scots\r\nbegan to come again, and robbed the people of their corn and cattle,\r\nand stole their children for slaves, and did a great deal of mischief.\r\n\r\n5. Now, if the British princes had agreed among themselves, and\r\njoined together to drive out these terrible foes, things might have\r\ngone on very well; but they were foolish enough to quarrel, and go to\r\nwar with one another; while some of the captains, who wanted to be\r\nprinces, got a number of soldiers to help them, and took possession\r\nof different places, where they called themselves kings, and made the\r\npeople obey them.\r\n\r\n6. They did not continue the good Roman laws; nor elect magistrates\r\nto keep order in the cities, as used to be done while the Romans were\r\nhere; and tillage was neglected, because the farmers were afraid\r\ntheir crops would be destroyed, so that numbers of people died of\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\n7. There were still many Romans in Britain, who were not soldiers but\r\nwere settled here, most of them having married into British families;\r\nand there were a great number of people who were Britons by birth,\r\nbut whose ancestors had been Romans; and all these were desirous that\r\nthe country should still be governed by the Roman laws, and formed\r\nwhat was called the Roman party.\r\n\r\n8. But there was a British party also, that wanted to do away with\r\nthe Roman laws altogether, and not to let the Romans have any thing\r\nto do with ruling the country; so each of these parties elected a\r\nking.\r\n\r\n9. The Britons chose a prince named Vortigern; and the Romans chose\r\none called Aurelius Ambrosius; and there was war between them.\r\n\r\n10. Then Vortigern, the British king, thought it would be a good\r\nthing to get some other brave people to join his party, that he might\r\nbe able to overcome his rival, as well as to drive away the Picts and\r\nScots; so he proposed to some of the British chiefs that they should\r\nask the Saxons to come and help them, and they thought it would be\r\na good plan.\r\n\r\n11. The Saxons inhabited the north of Germany, and parts of Holland\r\nand Denmark, which were then poor and barren countries.\r\n\r\n12. Many of their chiefs were pirates, that is, they lived by going\r\nout on the seas to fight and plunder; nor did they think it wicked so\r\nto do; but, on the contrary, imagined it was brave and noble.\r\n\r\n13. Two of them, Hengist and Horsa, happened to be cruising near\r\nthe British coast, when they received a message from Vortigern; who\r\nmade a bargain with them, and offered to give them the little island\r\nof Thanet, if they would come with all their men, to assist him in\r\ndriving out the Picts and Scots.\r\n\r\n14. Thanet is that part of Kent where Margate is now situated, but\r\nwas then separated by an arm of the sea, so that it was a small\r\nisland, standing alone, nearly a mile from the coast.\r\n\r\n15. The Saxons were very ready to come, for they knew that Britain\r\nwas a pleasant, fertile country, and hoped to get some of it for\r\nthemselves; but they did not let the Britons know they thought of\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n16. Hengist and Horsa were very brave, and their men were well armed,\r\nso they soon forced the Picts and Scots to retreat to their own\r\ncountry; and shortly afterwards they went to the Isle of Thanet,\r\nwhich they fortified, and many more Saxons came there to them.\r\n\r\n17. I cannot tell you how the affairs of the Britons went on, or what\r\nbecame of Vortigern; but this I can tell you, that the Saxons soon\r\nbegan to quarrel with the people of Kent, and fought with them, and\r\nhaving driven most of them away, took the land for themselves, and\r\nbegan to live there.\r\n\r\n18. The chief who made this conquest, was Esca, the son of Hengist,\r\nwho called himself king of Kent, which, from that time, was a small\r\nSaxon kingdom, for the Britons never won it back again.\r\n\r\n13. Then other chiefs, hearing how Esca had succeeded, got together\r\nbands of soldiers, and landed in different parts of the country, to\r\ntry to gain kingdoms also; but they did not all come at once, and\r\ntheir conquests were made by such slow degrees, that the wars lasted\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty years; so you may guess how hard the\r\nBritons fought in defence of their liberty.\r\n\r\n20. We can learn but very little about those unhappy times, for the\r\nfew histories that were then written were mostly destroyed in these\r\nlong wars; and though songs were composed by the bards or poets,\r\nwhich the people used to learn and teach to their children, these\r\nsongs were not all true.\r\n\r\n21. They were mostly about the wars, and the brave British chiefs who\r\ndefended the country against the Saxons; and if you should ever hear\r\nanybody speak of king Arthur, and the knights of the Round Table, you\r\nmay remember that he is said to have been one of those chiefs; and,\r\nif we may believe the tale, killed four hundred Saxons with his own\r\nhand in one battle.\r\n\r\n22. Those who made the story about him, say that the nobles of his\r\ncourt were all so equal in bravery and goodness, that he had a large\r\nround table made for them to feast at, that no one might sit above\r\nanother; so they were called knights of the Round Table. But let us\r\nreturn to our history.\r\n\r\n23. The Saxons went on making one conquest after another, till, at\r\nlast, they were in possession of the whole country; where very few\r\nof the natives were left, for most of those who had not been killed\r\nin the wars, had fled into Gaul, or taken refuge among the Welsh\r\nmountains; so from this time we shall hear no more of the Britons,\r\nbut must look upon the Saxons as the people of England.\r\n\r\n24. I told you how Esca had established the little kingdom of Kent.\r\nWell, in the course of the wars, six more kingdoms had been formed\r\nin the same manner, by different Saxon chiefs, so that, by the time\r\nthe conquest was completed, there were seven kingdoms in Britain,\r\nnamely, Kent, Sussex, Essex, and East Anglia, Northumbria, Wessex,\r\nand Mercia; and this division of the country among seven kings, was\r\ncalled the Saxon Heptarchy.\r\n\r\n25. The Saxons were not clever people, like the Romans, but were\r\nrough and ignorant, and cared for nothing but fighting; so while the\r\nwars were going on, they ruined and destroyed all the beautiful and\r\nuseful works that had been done in the Roman times; for they did\r\nnot understand their value, and only thought it was a fine thing to\r\ndestroy all that belonged to their enemies.\r\n\r\n26. But the works of the Romans were very strong; for even now, when\r\nworkmen are digging in London, and different parts of the country,\r\nthey sometimes find Roman walls, and pavements, and foundations of\r\nhouses, that show what good architects the Romans were.\r\n\r\n27. When the Saxons had got possession of the whole country, you\r\nmay perhaps suppose they would be quiet and contented, but this\r\nwas not the case; for as long as there were separate kingdoms, they\r\nwere continually at war with each other, and the principal cause of\r\ndisagreement was, that, among the kings, there was always one called\r\nthe Bretwalda, or ruler of Britain, who had some degree of authority\r\nover the rest; but as any one of them might be raised to this\r\ndignity, it was a constant source of quarrels and warfare, until, at\r\nlength, the weaker kingdoms were overcome by the more powerful ones,\r\nand there was but one king over the whole country, which then took\r\nthe name of Angleland or England, from a particular tribe of people\r\ncalled the Angles, who came here in great numbers with the Saxons.\r\n\r\n28. I dare say you did not know before how Britain came to be called\r\nEngland; and you would be very much amused to hear how many of the\r\nplaces in it, came by their present names.\r\n\r\n29. We will take for example Norfolk and Suffolk, which, with\r\nCambridge, formed the kingdom of East Anglia, and was conquered by\r\nthe Angles. Now these Angles consisted of two tribes, who divided\r\ntheir conquest between them, one tribe settling in the north part,\r\nthe other in the south; so that they were called North folk, and\r\nSouth folk, and thus came the names of the two counties.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

I am now going to tell you what sort of people the Saxons were,\r\nand how they lived after they were quite settled in England; for you\r\nought to know all about them, as they were our own ancestors, and\r\nmade a great many of our laws; and their language was English too,\r\nalthough it has so much altered that you would hardly know it for the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n2. The Saxons were not Christians when they first came here; but\r\ntheir religion was different from that of both the Druids and heathen\r\nRomans; for they worshipped great images of stone or wood, that they\r\nmade themselves, and called gods; and from the names of their gods\r\nand goddesses, our names of the days of the week are derived.\r\n\r\n3. At length, the bishop of Rome, who was called the Pope, sent some\r\ngood men to persuade the Saxons to leave off praying to wooden idols,\r\nand to worship the true God.\r\n\r\n4. These missionaries first went to Ethelbert, king of Kent, who\r\nwas then Bretwalda, and reasoned with him, so that he saw how wrong\r\nhe had been, and not only became a Christian himself, but let the\r\nmissionaries go and preach among the people, who were baptized in\r\ngreat numbers, and taught to believe in God and Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n5. The missionaries were all priests or monks; and some of them lived\r\ntogether in great houses called monasteries, which they built upon\r\nlands given them by the kings and nobles, on which they also raised\r\ncorn, and fed sheep and cattle.\r\n\r\n6. They had brought from Rome the knowledge of many useful arts,\r\nwhich they taught to the people, who thus learned to be smiths and\r\ncarpenters, and to make a variety of things out of metal, wood and\r\nleather, which the Saxons did not know how to make before.\r\n\r\n7. Then the priests could read and write, which was more than the\r\nnobles, or even the kings could do; and they used to write books, and\r\nornament the pages with beautiful borders, and miniature paintings;\r\nand the books, thus adorned, are called illuminated manuscripts.\r\n\r\n8. Still the Saxons, or English, as I shall henceforth call them,\r\nwere very rough and ignorant as compared with the Romans.\r\n\r\n9. Their churches and houses, and even the palaces of the kings, were\r\nrude wooden buildings, and the cottages of the poor people were no\r\nbetter than the huts of the ancient Britons.\r\n\r\n10. The common people were almost all employed in cultivating the\r\nland, and lived in villages on the different estates to which they\r\nbelonged; for the Saxon landlords were not only the owners of the\r\nland, but of the people also; who were not at liberty, as they are\r\nnow, to go where they pleased; neither could they buy land for\r\nthemselves, nor have any property but what their lords chose. I will\r\ntell you how it was.\r\n\r\n11. The Saxon lords had divided all the land amongst themselves, and\r\nhad brought from their own countries thousands of ceorls, or poor\r\npeople, dependent on them, to be their labourers.\r\n\r\n12. Each family of ceorls was allowed to have a cottage, with a few\r\nacres of land, and to let their cattle or sheep graze on the commons,\r\nfor which, instead of paying rent, they worked a certain number of\r\ndays in each year for their lord, and, besides, gave him a stated\r\nportion of those things their little farms produced; so that whenever\r\nthey killed a pig, they carried some of it to the great house; and\r\nthe same with their fowls, eggs, honey, milk and butter; and thus the\r\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s family was well supplied with provisions by his tenants, some\r\nof whom took care of his sheep and herds, cultivated his fields, and\r\ngot in his harvests.\r\n\r\n13. Then there were always some among them who had learned useful\r\ntrades, and thus they did all the kinds of work their masters wanted.\r\n\r\n14. Yet, with all this, the poor ceorls generally had enough for\r\nthemselves, and some to spare, which they sold at the markets, and\r\nthus were able to save a little money.\r\n\r\n15. Their cottages were round huts, made of the rough branches of\r\ntrees, coated with clay, and thatched with straw. They had neither\r\nwindows nor chimneys; but a hole was made in the roof to let out the\r\nsmoke from the wood fire, kindled on a hearth in the middle of the\r\nroom; and they used to bake their barley-cakes, which served them for\r\nbread, on these hearths, without any oven.\r\n\r\n16. They made a coarse kind of cloth for clothing from the wool of\r\ntheir sheep, a part of which was also given to their lord, and was\r\nused to clothe the servants of his household, for the rich people got\r\na finer cloth for themselves, which was brought from other countries.\r\n\r\n17. Great men usually wore white cloth tunics that reached to the\r\nknee, with broad coloured borders, and belts round the waist. They\r\nhad short cloaks, linen drawers and black leather shoes, with\r\ncoloured bands crossed on their legs, instead of stockings. The\r\ncommon people wore tunics of coarse dark cloth, and shoes, but no\r\ncovering on the legs.\r\n\r\n18. But I must tell you something more about these country folks,\r\nwho, at the time, formed the great mass of the English population.\r\nThey were, strictly speaking, in bondage, for they could not leave\r\nthe place where they were born, nor the master they belonged to,\r\nunless he gave them their freedom; they were obliged to serve as\r\nsoldiers in war time, and when the land was transferred to a new\r\nlord, the people were transferred with it.\r\n\r\n19. All they had might at any time be taken from them, and their sons\r\nand daughters could not marry, without consent of their lord.\r\n\r\n20. Yet these people considered themselves free, because they could\r\nnot be sold like the slaves; for I ought to tell you there was a\r\nlower class of bondmen, called thralls, and there were regular slave\r\nmarkets where they were bought and sold.\r\n\r\n21. A landowner could sell a thrall just as he could sell an ox;\r\nbut he could not sell a vassal tenant, or, as they were called in\r\nthe Saxon times, a ceorl, or churl, without the estate to which he\r\nbelonged. The thralls were employed to do the hardest and meanest\r\nwork, and had nothing of their own.\r\n\r\n22. The houses of the great men were very like large barns, and each\r\nhouse stood on an open space of ground, enclosed by a wall of earth\r\nand a ditch, within which there were stacks of corn, sheds for the\r\nhorses and cattle, and huts for the thralls to sleep in.\r\n\r\n23. The principal room was a great hall, strewed with rushes, and\r\nfurnished with long oak tables and benches.\r\n\r\n24. The windows were square holes crossed with thin laths, called\r\nlattices, and the fire-place was a stone hearth in the middle of the\r\nearthen floor, on which they used to burn great logs of wood, and let\r\nthe smoke go out at a hole in the door.\r\n\r\n25. But the great people often had merry doings in these halls,\r\nfor they were fond of feasting, and used to sit at the long wooden\r\ntables, without table cloths, and eat out of wooden platters or\r\ntrenchers with their fingers.\r\n\r\n26. Boiled meats and fish, usually salted, were put on the table in\r\ngreat wooden dishes, but roast meats were brought in on the spits\r\non which they were cooked, and handed round by the thralls, to the\r\ncompany, who helped themselves with knives which they carried at\r\ntheir girdles.\r\n\r\n27. There was plenty of ale, and among the richest, wine also, which\r\nthey drank out of horn cups; and when the meats were taken away, they\r\nused to drink and sing, and play on the harp, and often had tumblers,\r\njugglers, and minstrels to amuse them.\r\n\r\n28. Then the visitors used to lie down on the floor to sleep, covered\r\nwith their cloaks; for very few people had bedsteads, and the only\r\nbeds were a kind of large bags, or bed-ticks, filled with straw, and\r\nblocks of wood for pillows.\r\n\r\n29. Such were the rough manners of our Saxon forefathers, who were,\r\nhowever, in some respects a good sort of people, and you will be\r\nsorry for them by and by, when you read how the Normans came, and\r\ntook away their lands, and made slaves of them. But I must first tell\r\nyou what happened in the Saxon times, after the Heptarchy was broken\r\nup, and there was only one king of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  4. How were the Saxons converted to Christianity?\r\n\r\n  6. By what means did they learn many useful arts?\r\n\r\n  8. What was the condition of the common people?\r\n\r\n  15. Describe the cottages of the poor.\r\n\r\n  16. How did the Saxons dress?\r\n\r\n  21. What were ceorls? and what were thralls?\r\n\r\n  22. Describe the house of a Saxon chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE DANES AND ALFRED THE GREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED THE GREAT.]\r\n\r\n1. It was nearly 380 years after the first Saxons came here with\r\ntheir two pirate chiefs, Hengist and Horsa, that England began to\r\nhave only one king.\r\n\r\n2. There were still some other princes, who bore that title, but they\r\nhad so little power, that they could hardly be called kings; so that\r\na brave prince, named Egbert, who conquered the last kingdom of the\r\nHeptarchy, is usually called the first king of England.\r\n\r\n3. The civil wars were thus, for a time, ended; but it seemed as if\r\nthe English were never to be long at peace, for they now had some\r\nterrible enemies to contend with, who kept the country in constant\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n4. These were the Danes who came from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,\r\nand were almost the same people as the Saxons; for they spoke the\r\nsame language, followed the same customs, and lived by piracy, as the\r\nSaxons did in former times.\r\n\r\n5. I have not room to tell you of half the mischief they did in\r\nEngland. Sometimes they would land suddenly from their boats in the\r\nnight, when the affrighted people were awakened by a cry of, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nDanes! the Danes!\xe2\x80\x9d and, starting up, perhaps, beheld their villages\r\nin flames; and, as they ran in terror from their cottages, were\r\neither killed or dragged away to the pirate vessels, with the cattle\r\nand any thing else that could be found, and made slaves.\r\n\r\n6. Egbert had fought a battle with them in Cornwall, and forced them\r\nto depart; but, during the reign of Ethelwulf, the next king, and\r\nthree of his sons, they not only attacked the towns and villages\r\non the sea-coast, but used to seize the horses and ride about the\r\ncountry in search of plunder.\r\n\r\n7. They broke into the monasteries, where the people often put their\r\nmoney and jewels for safety; and if the inmates made any resistance\r\nthey would set the building on fire.\r\n\r\n8. Then they set up fortified camps, in many places; that is, a\r\nnumber of tents, arranged together, like a town surrounded with\r\na wall and ditch; and thus a great many of the Danes established\r\nthemselves in the country, and conquered all the northern part of it.\r\nThis was the sad state of affairs when Alfred the Great came to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n9. I dare say you have heard of this good prince, who was the\r\nyoungest and favorite son of king Ethelwulf, for he was the cleverest\r\nand best. His mother, being an accomplished lady, tried to teach all\r\nher sons to read; but none of them would learn except Alfred, who\r\nafterwards went to Rome to study Latin, and learn to write, so that\r\nhe was a good scholar for those times.\r\n\r\n10. His three brothers had all reigned in turn, and were all dead\r\nby the time he was twenty-two years old, therefore he was then heir\r\nto the crown; but, instead of being able to think about the best\r\nway of governing the country, he was obliged to get together as many\r\nsoldiers as he could, and go out with them to fight the Danes.\r\n\r\n11. There was no regular army then, as there is now; but, when the\r\nking wanted soldiers, he sent to all the noblemen and landholders\r\nin the kingdom, who were obliged to come themselves and bring so\r\nmany men with them, according to the size of their estates, some on\r\nhorseback, some on foot, and all well armed.\r\n\r\n12. You must remember that people could not buy land then for money,\r\nnor have it for paying rent; but large estates were given to the\r\nthanes and nobles by the king, on condition that they should perform\r\ncertain services for him; and you have already seen how the vassals\r\nof the nobles held their little farms on similar terms.\r\n\r\n13. This was called the feudal system, which means, holding land for\r\nservices instead of rent; and the person holding the land was called\r\nthe vassal of him to whom it belonged, whether rich or poor; so the\r\nnobles were the vassals of the king, and the ceorls were the vassals\r\nof the nobles.\r\n\r\n14. I think you now understand what the feudal system was, therefore\r\nI shall proceed with the history of Alfred the Great.\r\n\r\n15. The war had gone on for several years, and the king was so\r\nunfortunate that, at last, he was obliged to hide himself in a woody\r\nmarsh in Somersetshire, called the Isle of Athelney, because it was\r\nsurrounded by bogs and rivers.\r\n\r\n16. The Danes were then in pursuit of him; and, one time, fearing to\r\nbe taken prisoner, he got some man to let him keep his cows, or pigs,\r\nI do not know which; so that, if the Danes happened to see him, they\r\nmight not guess who he was.\r\n\r\n17. I dare say, you have heard the story of this peasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nscolding Alfred one day, for letting some cakes burn, which she had\r\nleft to bake on the hearth, whilst she was out; but she did not know\r\nthat he was the king, or, of course, she would not have taken that\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n18. At last, Alfred heard there were many chiefs and noblemen, with\r\ntheir vassals, ready to join him again; so he determined to try\r\nanother battle, but thought it would be prudent first to learn what\r\nwas the real strength of the enemy.\r\n\r\n19. Now the Danes, like the Saxons, were fond of good cheer, and\r\nliked to have songs and music to make them merry while they were\r\nfeasting; and this put it into Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s head to go into their camp\r\ndisguised as a harper, for he could play the harp and sing very well.\r\n\r\n20. So away he went, with his harp at his back, and, when he came\r\nthere, the Danish chiefs had him called into their tents, and made\r\nhim sit down and play to them, and gave him plenty to eat and drink.\r\n\r\n21. Then he heard them talking about king Alfred, and saying, they\r\nsupposed he was dead, as he did not come to fight them, so they need\r\nthink of nothing but enjoying themselves; and thus he discovered they\r\nwere not prepared for a battle, and were almost sure to be defeated,\r\nif taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n22. He, therefore, left the camp as soon as he could, and sent\r\na message to his friends to meet him in Selwood Forest, also in\r\nSomersetshire, with all the men they could muster; and, when they\r\nwere all come, he put himself at their head, and, marching suddenly\r\ndown upon the Danes, fought and won a great battle at Ethandune, a\r\nplace in Gloucestershire, now called Woeful Danes\xe2\x80\x99 Bottom, from the\r\nterrible slaughter of the Danes there.\r\n\r\n23. But there were a great many Danes in England who had not been\r\nengaged in this battle, and who had possession of almost all the\r\nnorthern part of the country; so the king wisely considered that\r\nit would be much better to induce them to settle peaceably in the\r\ncountry as friends, rather than prolong those dreadful wars, which\r\nhad already caused so much misery.\r\n\r\n24. He therefore proposed to the Danish chief that, if he would\r\npromise to keep at peace, he should have a wide tract of country,\r\nwhich had been desolated by these wars, all along the east coast,\r\nfrom the river Tweed to the river Thames, for himself and his people,\r\nto be called the Dane land; so Guthrun, the Danish chief, accepted\r\nthe offer, and parcelled the land out amongst his followers, who\r\nsettled there with their vassals, and lived the same manner as the\r\nSaxons.\r\n\r\n25. You may think how glad the people were that the wars were over,\r\nand the king was very glad too, for he now had time to do what was\r\nmore pleasant to him than fighting, which was, to do all the good he\r\ncould for the country. He thought the best way to defend it against\r\nits enemies was to have good ships to keep them from landing; but,\r\nas the English did not know much about ship-building, he sent for\r\nmen from Italy to teach them, and also had models of ships brought\r\nthat they might see how they were constructed, and men were taught to\r\nmanage them, so that England, for the first time, had a navy.\r\n\r\n26. These ships were called galleys, and were worked both with oars\r\nand sails; they were twice as long as those of the Danes, and stood\r\nhigher out of the water.\r\n\r\n27. While some workmen were making ships, others were employed in\r\nrebuilding of the towns and villages that had been burned down by\r\nthe Danes; and the king ordained that there should be schools in\r\ndifferent parts of the kingdom, where noblemen\xe2\x80\x99s sons might be\r\neducated, for he had found the benefit of learning himself, and\r\nthought it a sad thing that all the great men should be so ignorant\r\nas they were.\r\n\r\n28. You may, perhaps, wonder why so good a man as Alfred should only\r\nthink of having the great people taught to read; but reading would\r\nhave been of no use to the common people, as the art of printing was\r\nunknown, and there were no books but those written by the monks or\r\nnuns, which were so expensive that none but very rich people could\r\nafford to have even two or three of them.\r\n\r\n29. The principal school founded by king Alfred was at Oxford, which\r\nwas then a small, poor place, with a monastery, and a few mean wooden\r\nhouses for the scholars to live in, very different from the present\r\ngrand university, and the masters, who were all churchmen, and called\r\nlearned clerks, resided in the monastery.\r\n\r\n30. Alfred, with the help of some good and clever men, whom he\r\nconsulted in every thing, made some very wise laws, and obliged\r\nthe people to obey them, by having courts of justice held in the\r\nprincipal cities, regularly once a month; for nobody had thought much\r\nabout law or justice either, while the wars were going on, so that\r\nthere was need of some very strict regulations to restore good order,\r\nwithout which there can be neither happiness nor comfort any where.\r\n\r\n31. Under the good government of Alfred the Great, England enjoyed\r\nmore peace and prosperity than it had known since the days of the\r\nRomans; and as his son and grandson both endeavoured to follow his\r\nexample, the influence of his wisdom was felt long after his death,\r\nwhich happened when he was about fifty years old, in the year 900.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  2.

Alfred was succeeded by his son Edward, who was a very good king,\r\nthough not so clever as his father. He built walls round a great\r\nmany of the towns, to defend them in case the Danes should come\r\nagain; for, although so many of them were living quietly in the\r\ncountry, those who did not live here were still enemies, and the\r\nresident Danes were always ready to join their countrymen.\r\n\r\n2. But they could not do much mischief while Edward was king, or\r\nin the reign of his brave son Athelstan, who was almost as great a\r\nprince as Alfred himself.\r\n\r\n3. He knew that commerce was one of the best things in the world for\r\nany country, so he had more ships built, and sent them to trade with\r\nforeign countries; and he said that, when any man had made three\r\nvoyages in a vessel of his own, he should be made a Thane; which was\r\nthe same as knighting a gentleman in these days.\r\n\r\n4. There were no stores in England at this time, but the people\r\nbought every thing they wanted at markets and fairs; and they used to\r\nsalt a great deal of their meat and fish, that it might keep a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n5. In buying and selling, they sometimes used slaves and cattle,\r\ninstead of money, a man slave being worth a pound of silver, and an\r\nox worth a quarter of a pound, which was called five shillings, as a\r\nshilling was the twentieth part of a pound in weight.\r\n\r\n6. If a nobleman, therefore, wanted to buy any thing of two pounds\r\nvalue, he could pay for it with two of his thralls, or eight oxen,\r\nand the seller was obliged to take them; but he could sell them again\r\ndirectly; for I am sorry to say there were slave markets in England\r\ntill some time after the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\n7. Athelstan had a good deal of fighting to do, for the people of\r\nthe Daneland revolted, and he was obliged to lead his soldiers into\r\ntheir territory, to bring them to order; and then he had to march\r\nagainst Howel, the Prince of Wales, who was defeated in battle, when\r\nAthelstan nobly gave him back his dominions, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was more\r\nglory in making a king than in dethroning one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n8. I shall not mention all the kings that reigned after Athelstan,\r\nbecause there were many of them who did nothing that is worth telling\r\nabout; but I must speak of a great churchman, named Dunstan, who was\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, and, for several reigns, ruled the whole\r\ncountry, for the kings and nobles were obliged to do just as he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n9. He was a very clever man, and so good a worker in metals that he\r\nmade jewellery and bells, and gave them to some of the churches,\r\nwhich was considered an act of piety; for it was about this time\r\nthat bells began to be used in England, and they were highly valued.\r\n\r\n10. Dunstan persuaded the kings and rich noblemen, to rebuild the\r\nmonasteries that had been plundered and destroyed by the Danes, and\r\nendow them with lands; so that, at last, nearly one-third of all the\r\nlanded property in the kingdom belonged to the clergy.\r\n\r\n11. There was a king named Edgar, the fourth after Athelstan, who did\r\nmany useful things for the country; and, among others, he thought\r\nof a plan to destroy the wolves, which were so numerous in all the\r\nforests, that the people were in constant alarm for the safety of\r\ntheir sheep, and even of their little children.\r\n\r\n12. Edgar, therefore, ordered that each of the princes of Wales, who\r\nhad to pay tribute to the kings of England, should send, instead of\r\nmoney, three hundred wolves\xe2\x80\x99 heads every year; so they were obliged\r\nto employ huntsmen to go into the woods to kill those dangerous\r\nanimals, which were so generally destroyed in a few years that they\r\nhave seldom been found in England ever since.\r\n\r\n13. Then Edgar kept the Danes away by having as many as three hundred\r\nand sixty vessels always ready for service; but, when he and Dunstan\r\nwere dead the navy was neglected; and the country was again overrun\r\nwith those terrible enemies, who fought with the English every where,\r\nrobbed them of their property, took their houses for themselves, and\r\nacted just as if they were the conquerors and lords of the land.\r\n\r\n14. At last, the Danish king, Sweyn, landed with a great army, and\r\nbegan a dreadful war with Ethelred, who was then king of England,\r\nthat lasted about four years, in the course of which he and Ethelred\r\nboth died; but the war was continued by Canute, the son of Sweyn, and\r\nwith such success, that, in the end, he was crowned king of England.\r\n\r\n15. It was lucky for the English that Canute happened to be a wise\r\nand good prince; for he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAs I am now king of these\r\npeople, I will behave kindly to them, that they may love me, and\r\nthen we shall go on comfortably together.\xe2\x80\x9d So he began to repair the\r\nmischief that had been done in the late wars, by setting people to\r\nwork to rebuild the towns that had been destroyed; which was soon\r\ndone in those days, when the houses were so roughly built, and only\r\nof wood.\r\n\r\n16. He also made a law that the Danes should not rob and insult the\r\nEnglish, as they had been in the habit of doing; and ordered that\r\nthey should obey the other laws of the country; which he did not\r\nalter in the least; neither did he interfere with the estates of the\r\nnobles, nor with their rights over their vassals; and he consulted\r\nwith the Witanagemote, or Parliament, in all affairs of importance.\r\n\r\n17. This Parliament was composed of the great nobles and the bishops,\r\nso that it was like our House of Lords; and, when the king made a\r\nnew law, the people were not obliged to obey it, until it had been\r\napproved by the Witanagemote.\r\n\r\n18. As long as Canute reigned, which was nineteen years, there were\r\npeace and plenty, and the poor people were much happier than they\r\nhad been for a long time, for they could stay at home and mind their\r\nfarms, or work at their trades, without being called away continually\r\nto fight the Danes.\r\n\r\n19. The king, it is true, kept a large army of Danish soldiers, and\r\nthe people had to pay heavy taxes to support them; but this was\r\nbetter than seeing them come as enemies into the towns and villages\r\nto destroy or take every thing.\r\n\r\n20. After the death of Canute, his two sons reigned in succession,\r\nbut they were neither very good nor very clever, and both died\r\nwithin six years.\r\n\r\n21. All this while there was a Saxon prince, named Edward, son of\r\nking Ethelred, living at the court of the Duke of Normandy, who was\r\nhis uncle, and had afforded him shelter and protection whilst his\r\nenemies were ruling in England.\r\n\r\n22. He was now restored to the throne, and the English people thought\r\nthemselves happy in having again a king of their own nation; but they\r\nlittle foresaw the terrible consequences of placing over them one who\r\nhad formed so close a connection with the Normans.\r\n\r\n23. Edward was attached to the Normans, for they had been kind to\r\nhim in his misfortunes; but it was neither wise nor just to bring\r\na great number of them to his court, and set them up above his\r\nown countrymen, by giving them the highest appointments in the\r\ngovernment, which, of course, gave offence to the English noblemen.\r\n\r\n24. Edward was called the Confessor, because he spent much of his\r\ntime in devotion. He rebuilt Westminster Abbey, which was founded\r\nduring the Heptarchy; but this building was pulled down about 160\r\nyears afterwards, by Henry the Third, who erected the present edifice\r\nin its place.\r\n\r\n25. But I was going to tell you what happened in consequence of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s attachment to the Normans. His uncle was dead, and his cousin\r\nWilliam, a bold spirited prince, who was now Duke of Normandy, came\r\nover to England to visit the king, and see what sort of a place it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n26. He brought a great many noblemen with him, and it seems they all\r\nliked the country so much that the Duke thought he should like to\r\nbe its king, and his friends thought they should like to get good\r\nestates here; so king Edward was persuaded to make a will, or give\r\nhis promise, that, when he died, his cousin William, who was more\r\nthan twenty years younger than himself, should be his successor.\r\nThe English lords knew nothing about this at the time, but they had\r\nreason enough to know it afterwards, as you will presently find.\r\n\r\n27. Edward the Confessor died at the beginning of the year 1066,\r\nwhen Harold, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother, a brave and popular nobleman, took\r\npossession of the throne, with the consent of the chief nobles and\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1. Who succeeded Alfred?\r\n\r\n  2. Who was the next king?\r\n\r\n  3. How was trade encouraged by him?\r\n\r\n  5. Tell me the way of making purchases at this period.\r\n\r\n  7.

When did Edward die, and who succeeded him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAN CONQUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF HAROLD.]\r\n\r\n1. As soon as the Duke of Normandy knew that Edward the Confessor\r\nwas dead, and Harold made king, he called his friends together, and\r\npromised to bestow lands and honors in England on all who would\r\nassist him to win the crown; which, he said, was his by right, and\r\nthat Harold was an usurper.\r\n\r\n2. Now this is a doubtful question; for, although the king could\r\nappoint a successor, if he thought proper; yet it was necessary\r\nthat his choice should have the approval of the Witenagemote,\r\nwhich had not been given in this case; so the English said that,\r\nnotwithstanding king Edward\xe2\x80\x99s will, the Duke of Normandy had no right\r\nto the throne.\r\n\r\n3. I cannot pretend to say which was right; but, as it is of more\r\nconsequence to know how the dispute ended, we will proceed to the\r\nhistory of the conquest.\r\n\r\n4. The Normans were great warriors; so that even many of the clergy\r\nwould sometimes put on armour under their robes, and lead their own\r\nvassals to battle; and they had as much interest in the dispute as\r\nthe nobles, for they expected to come into possession of some of the\r\nBishops\xe2\x80\x99 sees and rich abbey lands, provided Duke William should\r\nsucceed in his enterprise.\r\n\r\n5. While all this was going on in Normandy, Harold\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Tosti,\r\nhad raised a rebellion in the north of England, and was joined by the\r\nking of Norway, who landed with an army in Yorkshire: so Harold had\r\nto go and fight with them, and there was a great battle at Stamford\r\nBridge, where the king gained a complete victory.\r\n\r\n6. Two or three days after this he was enjoying himself at a great\r\nfeast, at York, when news was brought to him that the Normans had\r\nlanded in Sussex, where they were doing all manner of mischief,\r\ndriving the people away from the towns and villages, and taking every\r\nthing they could lay their hands on.\r\n\r\n7. The king made all the haste he could to get his soldiers together,\r\nand began his march to oppose the invaders, but it took nearly a\r\nfortnight to get to where they were; and all that time the invaders\r\nwere making dreadful havoc for miles round their camp, so that the\r\nterrified people fled to the woods, or shut themselves up in the\r\nchurches, for fear of being killed.\r\n\r\n8. At last, Harold came, and a battle was fought near Hastings, on\r\nthe 14th of October, 1066, where the king and two of his brothers,\r\nwith a great many of the English nobles, were slain, and the\r\nconqueror from that day looked upon himself as the master of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n9. But the English had seen enough of the Normans to know that\r\nthey should be very badly treated if they once suffered a Norman\r\ngovernment to be established, so they resolved to do their utmost to\r\nprevent it, and thus the Normans had to fight for every town, and\r\ncastle, before it was given up to them.\r\n\r\n10. William had marched to London, and laid siege to it, soon after\r\nthe battle of Hastings, and the people having submitted to him, he\r\nwas crowned in Westminster Abbey, on Christmas day.\r\n\r\n11. A few of the English nobles went to offer their submission, that\r\nis, they agreed to obey him as their king, since he had promised that\r\nall who did so should be permitted to enjoy their rank and property\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\n12. But it was only a few who trusted to these promises, and they\r\nwere deceived in the end, for it is almost certain that the Conqueror\r\nintended, from the first, to take every thing from the English to\r\ngive to the Normans.\r\n\r\n13. I mean the English lords; for he meant to make the common people\r\nremain on the estates to which they belonged, that the new masters\r\nmight have vassals and slaves to cultivate their lands.\r\n\r\n14. Now the poor people did not like this any more than the nobles\r\nthemselves, so they fought bravely for their masters in many places;\r\nbut it was all to no purpose; for, at the end of seven years, the\r\nNormans were in possession of all the land in the country, and most\r\nof its former lords had either been killed, or were reduced to such\r\na state of poverty and wretchedness that it is melancholy to think of.\r\n\r\n15. I will not attempt to describe the sufferings of the people\r\nduring that long period, but you may imagine how very miserable they\r\nmust have been, for the Normans got the better of them all over the\r\ncountry, and took delight in robbing and insulting their unhappy\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\n16. I told you that the design of the Conqueror was to take all the\r\nland, and divide it among his followers, except what he chose to keep\r\nfor himself, as crown lands.\r\n\r\n17. Now there were many Saxon ladies who possessed estates, in\r\nconsequence of their fathers or brothers having been killed at the\r\nbattle of Hastings; and most of these heiresses were compelled,\r\nagainst their will, to marry Norman lords, who thus gained lands as\r\nwell as brides.\r\n\r\n18. Then the estates of all those who had not submitted to the king\r\nwere declared to be forfeited, and William gave them to the Normans,\r\nor, more properly speaking, he gave the Barons leave to take them by\r\nforce; so the English lords had to fight for their houses and lands,\r\nand many were killed, and many fled to other countries.\r\n\r\n19. The rustics, on these forfeited estates, would fight for their\r\nlord to the last; but, when he was forced to yield, they had no\r\nchoice but to submit to the new lord, or to see their cottages set\r\non fire, and their wives and children perhaps murdered before their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n20. Some of the English nobles hid in the forests with their\r\nfamilies, and as many of their vassals as would go with them, where\r\nthey made habitations, and supported themselves by robbery and\r\nhunting; and this was the origin of the numerous bands of robbers\r\nthat, in after times, were the terror of the country.\r\n\r\n21. The famous Robin Hood, who lived in the reign of Richard the\r\nFirst, is supposed to have been a descendant of one of these\r\nunfortunate English nobles.\r\n\r\n22. The Bishops\xe2\x80\x99 sees and abbey lands were seized in the same violent\r\nmanner, as the estates of the nobles, and given to the Norman clergy;\r\nand many of the monasteries, after being broken open and plundered,\r\nwere taken for the abode of monks who came over from Normandy in\r\ngreat numbers.\r\n\r\n23. The Normans built a great many castles in different parts of\r\nthe country; and, if they wanted to build one on a spot where there\r\nhappened to be houses, they thought nothing of turning out the\r\ninhabitants, and pulling down the houses, to make room: and they\r\npressed the poor people, both men and women, to do all the labour,\r\nwithout pay, and treated them very cruelly besides; for, if they did\r\nnot work hard enough, these unfeeling taskmasters would urge them on\r\nwith blows.\r\n\r\n24. Then wherever the Norman soldiers stayed, they went and lived in\r\nthe houses of the people, took what they pleased, and made the family\r\nwait upon them.\r\n\r\n25. The king, himself, cruelly laid waste different parts of the\r\ncountry in revenge for the opposition made to his progress by some of\r\nthe English earls, especially in the north, where, about three years\r\nafter the battle of Hastings, such a scene of desolation was made by\r\nfire and sword, that, from York to Durham, the houses, the people,\r\nand all signs of cultivation, were utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n26. The last stand made against the Normans was in a little island,\r\nformed by bogs and lakes, in Cambridgeshire, and still called the\r\nIsle of Ely. There, a brave chief, named Hereward, set up a fortified\r\ncamp, and was joined by other noblemen, and many of their dependents,\r\nwho, with the ceorls, or tenants, belonging to the Abbey of Ely, made\r\nquite an army.\r\n\r\n27. It was a secure place of refuge, because the only safe paths into\r\nthe island were unknown to the Normans, who would most likely have\r\nbeen lost in the bogs, if they had ventured to approach.\r\n\r\n28. But they had built a castle close by, at Cam Bridge, and they\r\nbrought boats and tried to make causeways by which they might get\r\ninto the camp of refuge; but the English would go out in bands\r\nat night and destroy all that their enemies had done, and kept\r\nconstantly on the watch for straggling parties, who were often\r\nattacked unawares, and many of them killed, while the English could\r\nalways retreat to their camp, where they were safe from pursuit.\r\n\r\n29. At last the Normans established a blockade of boats round the\r\nisland, and provisions began to get scarce within it; so two or three\r\nbad selfish men, who lived in the abbey, went to the Normans at Cam\r\nBridge, and said, they would show them the way into the island, if\r\nthey would promise not to meddle with the abbey.\r\n\r\n30. These men led the Normans secretly into the island, and a\r\nterrible battle was fought, in which almost all the English were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n31. When Hereward saw it was useless to fight any longer, he made his\r\nescape, and went to his own castle of Bourn, in Lincolnshire; where I\r\nbelieve, he afterwards made peace with the king, and was allowed to\r\nkeep his estate.\r\n\r\n32. I have given you a long history of the Conquest, because it\r\nwas the most important event that ever occurred in the history of\r\nEngland, and was the last sudden and violent change made in this\r\ncountry by foreign invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1. Explain the cause of the Norman invasion.\r\n\r\n  8. What was the battle of Hastings, and where was it fought?\r\n\r\n  9. Did the English make any further resistance?\r\n\r\n  14. How long was it before the conquest was completed?\r\n\r\n  18. How did many of the Norman lords obtain their estates?\r\n\r\n  20. What became of the English nobles?\r\n\r\n  23. How were the English treated by the Norman soldiers?\r\n\r\n  26. What was the Camp of Refuge, and by whom established?\r\n\r\n  31. What became of Hereward?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAN PERIOD.--1087 TO 1154.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF WILLIAM RUFUS.]\r\n\r\n1. The Normans were a cleverer people than the English, and lived\r\nin a superior manner. They were better acquainted with the arts of\r\nagriculture and architecture, and they knew a great deal more about\r\nuseful gardening; for all the convents in Normandy had good gardens,\r\nplanted with vegetables and herbs; and the monks brought over plenty\r\nof seeds and roots to sow or plant in gardens here.\r\n\r\n2. The Normans built stone castles, and strong houses of timber,\r\nwith upper stories, so that their dwellings, in general, were\r\nhigher and more substantial than those of the Saxons; and one great\r\nimprovement was that they had chimneys; but their furniture was as\r\nrough and clumsy as the furniture used in the Saxon times, and their\r\nway of living was almost the same, except that they did not care so\r\nmuch about feasting, but preferred spending their time in hunting,\r\nhawking, and fighting in sport, for pastime.\r\n\r\n3. I should here tell you that William the Conqueror made the first\r\ngame laws, and very severe they were, and very hard upon the poor\r\npeople, who used to be at liberty to kill game in the forests; but,\r\nafter these new laws, they dared not so much as take even a hare or\r\npartridge in their own fields.\r\n\r\n4. It was not only the English, who were forbidden to hunt on the\r\nroyal domains, but the Normans also, unless they had special leave to\r\ndo so; and, if any one was bold enough to kill a deer in the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforests, he was punished in the most cruel manner, by having his eyes\r\nput out, or his hands cut off.\r\n\r\n5. The king\xe2\x80\x99s palace was at Winchester, and he wanted to have a\r\nforest close by for hunting, so he ordered that all the towns and\r\nvillages should be pulled down for about thirty miles, and the land\r\nplanted with trees; and, what was worse, he gave nothing to the poor\r\npeople for turning them out of their homes; and this is still called\r\nthe New Forest.\r\n\r\n6. In imitation of this bad example, many of the nobles began to make\r\nlarge parks, enclosed with walls to keep deer, and they cared no more\r\nthan William had done about taking away the fields and pasture lands\r\nof the poor cottagers, who dared not complain, and were even obliged\r\nto run to their doors with refreshments to offer to the Norman lords\r\nand their followers when they were out hunting, although they often\r\nsaw them riding over their corn, and breaking through their hedges.\r\n\r\n7. It was not till after several reigns that the descendants of the\r\nNorman Conquerors began to consider themselves Englishmen, and to\r\ntreat their vassals more like fellow countrymen.\r\n\r\n8. The first hundred years after the conquest is therefore usually\r\ncalled the Norman period, and includes the reigns of William the\r\nConqueror, William Rufus, Henry the First, and Stephen.\r\n\r\n9. I have already told you that the Feudal system was brought into\r\nEngland by the Saxons, and I explained what it was; but I must now\r\nmention that this system was carried much farther by the Normans,\r\nthat is, their feudal laws were stricter, and the nobles themselves\r\nwere bound by them as well as the common people.\r\n\r\n10. I should wish you to understand this as clearly as possible,\r\nbecause the manners and customs of the age were governed entirely by\r\nthose laws.\r\n\r\n11. First, then, the king was lord of the land, and kept a great\r\nportion of it for himself, which made what were called crown lands;\r\nand all the people, who lived on the crown lands, whether in burgh,\r\ntown, or country, were his tenants, and paid him rent, or taxes,\r\nboth in money and produce, besides being obliged to furnish him with\r\nsoldiers at their own expense.\r\n\r\n12. For example, if a town had to find two or more horse-soldiers,\r\nthe inhabitants were, besides, obliged to pay the expenses of their\r\narms, horses and maintenance, for the time they were on service.\r\n\r\n13. The Manors and Abbey lands were held of the king on the same\r\nconditions; and every man, who had a certain quantity of land, was\r\nbound either to serve as a soldier himself, or send a substitute.\r\n\r\n14. The rest of the country was divided by the king amongst the great\r\nbarons, who agreed, in return, that whenever he went to war they\r\nwould go with him, and take with them so many men, properly armed\r\nand trained for warfare, perhaps fifty or a hundred, or even more,\r\naccording to the extent of lands they held.\r\n\r\n15. These great Baronies were called Feods, and the king was the\r\nfeodal or feudal lord of the barons, who were called crowned vassals;\r\nand, when any one of them died, the king took the lands again until\r\nthe heir paid him a large sum of money to redeem them.\r\n\r\n16. Some of the kings behaved very ill in this, in making the heirs\r\npay a great deal more than was just; and, if a baron died, and left\r\na daughter only, she was obliged to marry any one the king chose, or\r\nhe would not let her have her inheritance at all.\r\n\r\n17. The feudal laws were therefore very bad, because they gave men\r\nthe power of being tyrants to each other; for the nobles had the same\r\npower of oppressing their vassals that the king had of oppressing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n18. You must understand that the great Barons, who held very\r\nextensive domains, gave small estates out of them to men who were\r\nnot so high in rank as themselves, on the same conditions as the king\r\nhad given the large baronies to them, so that the lesser nobles were\r\nthe vassals of the great ones, and were bound to aid them with men\r\nand money when required.\r\n\r\n19. Then all the nobles, from the highest to the lowest degree, were\r\nthe absolute lords of all the common people that dwelt on their\r\nlands, and could make them do just whatever they pleased, as I told\r\nyou they could in the Saxon times; but then the Norman lords treated\r\nthem, at first, a great deal more harshly than the Saxon lords did,\r\nand took a great deal more from them.\r\n\r\n20. After the Norman conquest they were called villeins, which meant\r\nvillagers, and they lived in the same manner, and had the same kind\r\nof duties to perform for their lords, as in the Saxon times; but\r\nthere were many new feudal customs brought here by the Normans; as\r\nfor example, a mill was set up on every estate, to which all the\r\npoor people were obliged to take their corn to be ground, instead of\r\ngrinding it at home with hand-mills, as they used to do; and, out of\r\neach measure, a part was taken for the baron, which was a very hard\r\ntax upon them, especially if they had large families.\r\n\r\n21. Another feudal custom was this; a duty was laid on every thing\r\nsold at the fairs and markets; that is, if a man went to the market\r\nto buy a sheep, he must pay so much for the sheep, and so much for\r\nduty, the duty being for the baron, or lord of the manor.\r\n\r\n22. There were a great many other customs which I have not room to\r\nmention, but I think I have said enough to show you what the feudal\r\nsystem was in the first ages after the Norman conquest; so now I will\r\ntell you something about the first Norman sovereigns.\r\n\r\n23. William the Conqueror died in 1087, and was succeeded by his\r\neldest son, Robert, in Normandy, and by his second son, William\r\nRufus, in England; but after a time Duke Robert wanted money to\r\ngo to the Holy Wars, which I will tell you about presently, so he\r\nmortgaged his duchy of Normandy to his brother William, who thus\r\nbecame sovereign of both countries, as his father had been. He was a\r\nsad tyrant, and so rude in his manners that nobody liked him.\r\n\r\n24. I told you what strict game laws were made by the Conqueror,\r\nbut William Rufus made them more severe still, and so displeased\r\nthe noblemen, by forbidding them to hunt without his leave, that\r\nsome of them formed a conspiracy to dethrone him; but the plot was\r\ndiscovered, and the Earl of Northumberland, who was at the head of\r\nit, was taken prisoner, and confined in Windsor Castle all the rest\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\n25. There was another great lord, the Count d\xe2\x80\x99Eu, who was accused\r\nof being engaged in this plot, by a knight called Geoffrey Bainard,\r\nso the king had him arrested. The Count, however, denied having any\r\nthing to do with it, and said he defied his accuser, and was ready to\r\nfight with him, and that God would give the victory to whichever of\r\nthem was in the right.\r\n\r\n26. So they fought with swords, in the presence of the king and\r\ncourt, when Bainard was victorious, and the Count being thus\r\nconvicted, was condemned to have his eyes torn out.\r\n\r\n27. This was a strange way for a man to prove his innocence of any\r\ncrime, but it became a common custom in England, and was called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWager of battle.\xe2\x80\x9d Even law-suits, respecting right of property, were\r\noften thus decided; and, if a lady had a quarrel or a lawsuit, she\r\nmight get a man to do battle for her, and he was called her champion.\r\n\r\n28. It was the fashion for many ages, not only in England, but all\r\nover Europe, for young men of noble birth to roam about the world in\r\nsearch of adventures; and, as they were generally poor and depended\r\nchiefly on their swords for subsistence, they would engage in\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s quarrels; fight in the cause of women or children who were\r\neither injured or oppressed, and enlist in the service of princes and\r\nbarons who were at war.\r\n\r\n29. This was called chivalry, and these knights errant, or wandering\r\nknights, were made welcome wherever they went, and treated with\r\nhospitality at the castles of the great.\r\n\r\n30. Numbers of them went to the Holy Wars, but, as I suppose you do\r\nnot know what the Holy Wars were, I will tell you about them.\r\n\r\n31. Many pious Christians in those days thought it a duty to make a\r\njourney, or pilgrimage as it was called, to Jerusalem, once in their\r\nlives, to say their prayers at our Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s tomb; but Jerusalem\r\nhad been conquered by the Mahomedans, who hated the Christians, and\r\nbehaved very cruelly to the pilgrims; so the Pope, who you know is\r\nthe great Bishop of Rome, and at that time had more authority over\r\nall the countries of Europe than the kings had, said that it was the\r\nduty of all Christian warriors to go to Palestine, or the Holy Land,\r\nto fight against the Saracens, and try to drive them from Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n32. Then a religious man, called Peter the Hermit, went about\r\npreaching a crusade, that is, exhorting the princes and nobles in\r\nFrance, Germany, and Italy, to undertake this war, which was called\r\na crusade, or _croisade_, because the ensign on their banners was to\r\nbe the Cross.\r\n\r\n33. Robert, Duke of Normandy, was among the first crusaders, and, as\r\nhe wanted money to keep himself and all the fighting men he took with\r\nhim, he pledged his duchy to his brother, William Rufus, for a very\r\nlarge sum.\r\n\r\n34. The English did not join in these wars, at first, but after a\r\ntime there was scarcely a knight or noble in the land that did not\r\ngo to the Crusades, for they were continued, in all, more than two\r\nhundred years; and, during two hundred years; and, during that time,\r\ngreat numbers of the lower order of people in England were freed from\r\nbondage, in consequence of being allowed to purchase their liberty to\r\nsupply their lords with money for these wars.\r\n\r\n35. William Rufus, who was killed by accident as he was hunting\r\nin the New Forest, was succeeded by his brother, Henry the First,\r\nsurnamed Beauclerk, because he was a learned man, who behaved much\r\nbetter to the Saxon English than the two former kings had done,\r\nand restored to some of the old families a part of their ancient\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\n36. He likewise altered the forest laws, which had given so much\r\ndiscontent, and gave the citizens of London leave to hunt in Epping\r\nForest, which then reached very nearly to the walls of the city.\r\n\r\n37. Winchester was then the capital of England, but London was one\r\nof the best cities and the richest, as many of its inhabitants were\r\nmerchants who traded with foreign countries; yet the houses were only\r\nmean wooden buildings, with no glass in the windows, and thatched\r\nwith straw.\r\n\r\n38. Westminster was quite a separate city, and divided from London\r\nby country houses, fields and a village. The king had a palace at\r\nWestminster, and William Rufus built Westminster hall adjoining it,\r\nfor his Christmas feasts.\r\n\r\n39. A curious privilege was granted by Henry the First to the\r\ncitizens of London, which will serve to show you what grievances the\r\npeople were subject to in those times.\r\n\r\n40. There were a great number of persons who were employed in various\r\nways about the court, and who followed the king wherever he went; for\r\ngreat men, when they travelled, were obliged to take every thing they\r\nwanted with them, there being no public accommodation to be had any\r\nwhere; so they carried with them waggon loads of furniture, plate,\r\nwine, cooking utensils, and I do not know what besides; with their\r\ndomestics and retainers of all descriptions, who formed a numerous\r\nretinue.\r\n\r\n41. Now, the inhabitants of any city, where the king happened to be\r\nholding his court, were obliged to give board and lodging, at free\r\ncost, to all these people, who generally behaved very ill; for they\r\nwould insist upon having the best rooms, order whatever they chose,\r\nand treat the family just as if they were their servants.\r\n\r\n42. It was, therefore, a very good thing for the Londoners when king\r\nHenry released them from this heavy burthen, but all other towns had\r\nto bear it for a very long period.\r\n\r\n43. In this reign the first manufactory for woollen cloth was\r\nestablished in this country, by some weavers from Flanders, where the\r\nbest cloth was made from English wool, which was the staple commodity\r\nof England at that period; I mean, the thing of which they had most\r\nto sell; for quantities of sheep were reared on every estate.\r\n\r\n44. England had no manufactures then, so there were no employments\r\nfor the lower classes but agriculture, and the few useful arts, that\r\nwere but very imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\n45. Henry the First died in the year 1135. He left the crown to his\r\ndaughter Matilda, who had been twice married; first, to the Emperor\r\nof Germany, and again to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Earl of Anjou, who was\r\ndead also, therefore she was again a widow.\r\n\r\n46. But there was a nephew of the late king, named Stephen, who was\r\nrather a favorite among the Barons, and was quite willing to take\r\nadvantage of their good will; so, before Matilda could reach England,\r\nher cousin Stephen had mounted the throne.\r\n\r\n47. Then there was a civil war in this country, which was carried on,\r\nat times, for fifteen years, for a great many French noblemen came\r\nhere with Matilda to fight for her; and some of the English Barons,\r\nwho had become dissatisfied with Stephen, because he had not done\r\nall they expected he would do, joined the other party, and there was\r\nfighting all over the country.\r\n\r\n48. Wherever there is civil war, there is sure to be famine and\r\nmisery of all kinds, and there never was more misery in England than\r\nduring the reign of king Stephen; for, in order to keep as many of\r\nthe Barons on his side as he could, he let them do just as they\r\npleased; and he gave titles and estates to a great many bold and bad\r\nmen, who built castles and kept bands of ruffians, who went at night\r\nto rob and plunder the towns and villages; so that the people, when\r\nthey shut up their houses at night, used to kneel down and pray that\r\nGod would protect them from robbers and murderers.\r\n\r\n49. At last, it was settled that Stephen should keep the crown as\r\nlong as he lived; but that Matilda\xe2\x80\x99s son, Henry Plantagenet, should\r\nsucceed him; and, soon after this arrangement, he died, having\r\nreigned nineteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

As soon as Henry the Second came to the throne, he began to set\r\nthings to rights again. He had all the new castles pulled down, and\r\nmade the bad men who had lived in them, leave the country; then\r\nhe set people to work to rebuild the towns that had been burned\r\ndown in the late wars; and ordered that the judges should go on\r\ncircuits; that is, travel to all the cities, and hold assizes, two or\r\nthree times a year, as they do now, to see that justice is done to\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\n2. But it was not quite so easy to do justice then; for, as long as\r\nthe feudal laws lasted, the rich could always oppress the poor, and\r\nevery great man had an army of his own vassals, who would do any\r\nthing he bade them, whether it was lawful or not.\r\n\r\n3. Now the king wisely thought that the best thing in the world for\r\nthe country would be to give more freedom to the people, so that the\r\nBarons might not have quite so much power.\r\n\r\n4. He, therefore, granted charters to some of the cities, which made\r\nthem a little more independent; but it was by very slow degrees that\r\nthe people of England became free, although this happy change was\r\nbeginning to take place.\r\n\r\n5. Another thing the king wanted to do, was to make the clergy\r\nanswerable to the judges for any bad acts they might commit, instead\r\nof having particular laws and judges for themselves; and, I am sorry\r\nto say, they sometimes did very wicked things, for which they were\r\nnot punished half so severely as other people would have been for\r\nsimilar offences, which certainly was unjust.\r\n\r\n6. But the bishops were unwilling to let the king have any thing to\r\ndo with church affairs, and the Pope encouraged them to oppose him,\r\nin this respect; for the Pope, in those days, had more power over all\r\nEurope than the kings themselves, who seldom dared to disobey him.\r\n\r\n7. The person who quarrelled most with Henry about these things was\r\nThomas \xc3\xa0 Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, a very proud man, who\r\nwanted to rule both king and state his own way.\r\n\r\n8. The king was so much annoyed at the opposition he constantly met\r\nwith from the archbishop, that one day, in a fit of passion, he said\r\nhe wished that troublesome priest was dead; on which some persons,\r\nwho heard these incautious words thinking to get into favor, rode off\r\nto Canterbury, and killed the archbishop in his Cathedral.\r\n\r\n9. But they gained nothing by this wicked deed; for the king was\r\nshocked when he heard of it, and sorry for what he had said; which\r\nshows how wrong it is for people to use violent expressions when they\r\nfeel angry.\r\n\r\n10. One very remarkable event which occurred in this reign, was the\r\nconquest of Ireland. That country had been, for many years, divided\r\ninto several small kingdoms, and the disputes of the chiefs had often\r\ngiven rise to warfare among themselves; but it now happened that the\r\nking of Leinster, having been deposed by another prince, went direct\r\nto the king of England, to beg his assistance, which Henry readily\r\npromised, on condition that, if he were restored, he should hold his\r\nkingdom as a vassal of the English crown.\r\n\r\n11. Dermot, that was the name of the Irish prince, agreed to these\r\nterms, and several English knights and noblemen undertook the\r\nenterprise. After a great many interesting adventures, which are told\r\nin the history of Ireland, Dermot was replaced on his throne; but\r\nother quarrels arising among the chiefs, the English continued the\r\nwar, and, after some time, the Irish chiefs acknowledged the king of\r\nEngland as a lord and master of Ireland, which has been under the\r\nauthority of the English government ever since.\r\n\r\n12. Henry the Second died in 1189, and was succeeded by his son\r\nRichard, who was called C\xc5\x93ur-de-lion, because he was very brave, so\r\nthat everybody said he had the heart of a lion.\r\n\r\n13. Now it is a very good thing for men to be brave, for I do not\r\nknow what we should do without brave men for soldiers and sailors,\r\nto fight for us; but it is not the most useful quality a king can\r\npossess; and I think you will agree with me, when I tell you that\r\nRichard the First, instead of staying at home to make good laws, and\r\ntake care of his subjects, went away to fight, or gain glory, as\r\nfighting was then called, in the Holy Land, while all things were\r\ngoing wrong in England, for the want of somebody to keep order.\r\n\r\n14. But there was some excuse for him, as everybody in those days\r\nthought that the most praiseworthy act princes and nobles could do,\r\nwas to fight for their religion against all persons who believed\r\ndifferently from themselves; so Richard was very much admired by his\r\npeople, although he did nothing for their real benefit; but, on the\r\ncontrary, caused them very much misery, and great distress.\r\n\r\n15. Another evil was that the Barons, who went with him to the\r\nCrusades, took all their own money as well as all they could get from\r\ntheir tenants, to support themselves and their fighting men abroad,\r\nso that the generality of the people were left very poor.\r\n\r\n16. A great number, indeed, obtained their freedom, by giving up\r\nall they had to their lords; but then they were left without money\r\nor employment, and many turned robbers, to save themselves from\r\nstarving; therefore, you see, it was not always a good thing, at\r\nfirst, for the bondmen to be set at liberty; but it was good in the\r\nend, for their children were born free, and, as times got better, the\r\nfree middle classes began to be of some consequence, and have gone\r\non gradually increasing in wealth and importance, till they have now\r\nbecome the best safeguard and support of the country.\r\n\r\n17. While Richard was gone to the wars, his brother John, who was a\r\nvery bad man, wanted to make himself king in England, and there were\r\nsome of the nobles who encouraged him, while others defended the\r\nrights of the absent monarch; so that there was great confusion, and\r\nthe laws were sadly disregarded.\r\n\r\n18. At last, Richard heard of all these bad doings, and left the Holy\r\nLand, intending to come home as fast as he could; but, unfortunately,\r\nhe was made prisoner, on his way, by the Duke of Austria, and\r\nconfined in a castle in Germany for some time before the English\r\npeople knew what had become of him.\r\n\r\n19. Richard knew this duke was his enemy, because he had affronted\r\nhim when in the Holy Land, so he had taken the precaution of\r\ndisguising himself in passing through his dominions, and took with\r\nhim only a single page; but, one day, being tired and hungry, he\r\nstopped to rest at a village near Vienna, and sent his page into that\r\ncity to buy some provisions.\r\n\r\n20. The youth, foolishly, hung a pair of handsome gloves in his\r\nbelt, and as gloves were, in those days, only worn by persons of\r\nthe highest rank, this circumstance excited suspicion, and he was\r\narrested, and obliged to confess the truth.\r\n\r\n21. The duke immediately sent a band of soldiers to seize the king,\r\nwhom they found busy turning some meat that was roasting at the fire.\r\n\r\n22. He started up, drew his sword, and fought valiantly, but was\r\ncaptured, and sent to a strong fortress, where he had remained a\r\nprisoner some months, when he was discovered, it has been stated, by\r\na wandering minstrel, who heard him singing in his prison, and knew\r\nhis voice. But this is a fabulous tale.\r\n\r\n23. A large sum was raised in England, by taxes, for his ransom,\r\nand he came back; but he did not stay long at home; for he had\r\nquarrelled, while in the Holy Land, with the king of France, and went\r\nover to Normandy for the purpose of going to war with him, where he\r\nwas killed by a poisoned arrow, aimed at him from the walls of a\r\ncastle he was besieging, in the year 1199, having reigned ten years.\r\n\r\n24. Prince John was now made king of England, but he had no lawful\r\nright to the throne, as prince Arthur, the orphan son of an elder\r\nbrother, was living, and was the true heir, according to the rules of\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n25. But this unfortunate prince was made prisoner, in Normandy, by\r\nhis wicked uncle, and most people believe he met with a violent death.\r\n\r\n26. It was a very serious misfortune for the country when the king\r\nhappened to be a bad man, because the government was, at that time,\r\ndespotic; that is, the king made the laws himself, and had the power\r\nof doing whatever he pleased; whereas, now, the laws are made by the\r\nparliament; so that, before any new act can be passed, a great many\r\ngood and clever men must agree to it, which is a great protection to\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n27. However, king John was compelled much against his will, to make\r\nsome very good laws, and the reason of this was, that his tyranny\r\nwas felt by the nobles even more than the common people, for their\r\nestates were often unjustly seized, and they were obliged to give\r\nhim large sums of money to get them back again; then he would not\r\nlet them marry unless they paid him for leave to do so; and if any\r\nperson wanted to go out of the country, they were obliged to buy\r\nhis permission. In short, no one was free to do any thing till the\r\nconsent of the king was obtained by a handsome present.\r\n\r\n28. At length, his tyranny was carried to such a height that the\r\nchief nobles resolved to make him act more justly, or dethrone him;\r\nso they wrote down, on parchment, all the things they wished to have\r\ndone, or altered, and agreed with each other that, if he refused to\r\nsign it, they would go to war with him, and they took care to have\r\nall their vassals armed, and in readiness.\r\n\r\n29. John was very much frightened when he found the barons were in\r\nearnest, and agreed to meet them at a place called Runnymede, between\r\nStaines and Windsor, where, after a great deal of disputing, he was\r\nobliged to sign his name to what they had written, which thus became\r\nthe law of the land. An ancient copy of this parchment is now in the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n30. It is called Magna Charta, which is the Latin name for \xe2\x80\x98the Great\r\nCharter;\xe2\x80\x99 and it was framed with a view to take from the king the\r\npower of doing unjust things, and to make him govern according to the\r\nlaws, and not to be able to make new laws, or impose new taxes, at\r\nhis pleasure.\r\n\r\n31. This famous act is generally regarded as the beginning of the\r\nliberty which all Englishmen are so justly proud of; but the laws it\r\ncontained were, in many respects often broken by the sovereigns of\r\nEngland, for a very long period.\r\n\r\n32. The Barons of England still lived in their castles, on their own\r\nestates, in the midst of their vassals and serfs. Their castle-halls\r\nwere crowded with knights, squires, pages, and military dependents,\r\nfor it was their pride to have as many of such retainers as they\r\ncould possibly maintain. The pages were boys of high rank, generally\r\nthe younger sons of noblemen, whose profession was to be knight\r\nerrantry.\r\n\r\n33. Now, in order to obtain the honour of knighthood, they were\r\nobliged to serve some great baron, first as pages, then as esquires,\r\nfor several years, and to be very obedient and respectful in their\r\nconduct, and do all that was required of them readily and cheerfully.\r\n\r\n34. While pages, they had to wait upon their lords and his guests at\r\ndinner and supper, to carry messages, and perform little services for\r\nthe ladies of the family; but they were themselves waited upon by the\r\ndomestic slaves, and, when they had finished their day\xe2\x80\x99s duties,\r\nwere allowed to mix with the company.\r\n\r\n35. They were taught to use the sword and lance, and to manage a\r\nhorse skilfully, and were instructed in religious duties by the\r\npriests of their lord\xe2\x80\x99s household.\r\n\r\n36. When old enough, they were made esquires, and then their duties\r\nwere to take care of the horses and armour, and to attend their lords\r\non all occasions; which services he usually rewarded by making them\r\nknights, when they were free to go wherever they pleased; and you\r\nhave already been told what their mode of life was afterwards.\r\n\r\n37. The great people were very fond of hunting and hawking, and\r\nfighting at tournaments; but, perhaps, you do not know what a\r\ntournament was, so I will tell you.\r\n\r\n38. There was a place built up, something like a large theatre,\r\nwith galleries for the ladies and gentlemen, to sit and see the\r\ncombats in the open space below, and this was called the lists.\r\nThen the gentlemen, who wished to exhibit their valour, used to\r\ncome in armour, and fight with each other on horseback till one was\r\nconquered, when the victor received a prize from the greatest lady\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n39. When only two knights fought, it was called a tilt; but if there\r\nwere several on each side, it was a tournament; and, although these\r\ncombats were held for sport, the combatants were often dangerously\r\nwounded, and sometimes killed.\r\n\r\n40. When John had signed Magna Charta, the Barons went home to\r\ntheir castles, to enjoy their usual pleasures; but the king had no\r\nintention of behaving any better than before, and secretly sent\r\nagents to Flanders, to raise troops of foreigners, promising that\r\nthey should be allowed to plunder the estates of the Barons, if they\r\nwould enlist in his service.\r\n\r\n41. Thus he soon appeared at the head of an army, and went to war\r\nwith the nobles, who, in revenge, did a very wrong and foolish thing,\r\nwhich was, to offer the crown to Louis, the son of the king of France.\r\n\r\n42. Louis soon came over with a French army, and, after having in\r\nvain tried to take Dover Castle, he entered London in triumph, whilst\r\nJohn was obliged to retreat; but the Barons began to think they\r\nhad done wrong, and, as John died suddenly, in the midst of this\r\nconfusion, they turned their arms against Louis, and forced him to\r\nleave the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

The reign of Henry the Third, who was only nine years of age when\r\nhe succeeded his father, was a very long and a very unhappy one.\r\n\r\n2. At first, things went on very well, because the king had a good\r\nguardian, the Earl of Pembroke, who managed the government wisely;\r\nbut he, in a few years, died, and others came into power who did\r\nnot act so well, and the king was too young to know what was right\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n3. It was a pity the good earl died, for, if Henry had been fortunate\r\nenough to have had a wise instructer, he might have been a better\r\nsovereign, but, as it was, he was a very bad one.\r\n\r\n4. The great mischief was this. He married a French princess, who had\r\nno more wisdom than himself; and they were both so extravagant that\r\nthey spent a great deal more money than they could afford; and, then,\r\nto get fresh supplies, the king ordered the people to pay more taxes,\r\nand began to do all the unjust things that had caused so much misery\r\nin the time of his father.\r\n\r\n5. Sometimes the Barons assembled and obliged him to promise he would\r\nabide by the terms of Magna Charta; but he soon forgot his promises,\r\nand went on the same as before, so that the people were worse and\r\nworse off every year, and many men became robbers on the highways,\r\nbecause they could not support their families by honest industry.\r\n\r\n6. This was the state of affairs for many years, till at last, there\r\nwas a civil war again, and, after a great deal of fighting and\r\nbloodshed, the king and his eldest son, Edward, were made prisoners\r\nin a battle, fought at Lewes, in Sussex, in 1264, and the Earl of\r\nLeicester, the king\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law, took the government upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n7. This was an important event, because the earl summoned a\r\nparliament to consult as to what it would be best to do under these\r\ncircumstances; and he desired that, besides the nobles and bishops,\r\nthere should come to this parliament knights, or gentlemen from\r\nevery county, and citizens and burghers, from every city and burgh\r\nto state what the condition of the people really was, and to help\r\nto advise what could be done for them; so that the commoners were\r\nnow, probably, for the first time, admitted to some share in the\r\ngovernment of the country, which was a great step gained by the\r\npeople, who, before this, had no representatives in the national\r\ncouncil, or parliament, to take their part; and this was the\r\nbeginning of our House of Commons, so it is worth remembering.\r\n\r\n8. Prince Edward, after this, escaped from Hereford, where he had\r\nbeen kept a prisoner, and gained a great victory over the Barons, and\r\nreplaced his father Henry on the throne; after which, he went on a\r\ncrusade to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n9. He had married a Spanish princess, named Eleanor, who was the\r\nfirst person, in England, that had a carpet, which she brought from\r\nSpain, for the floors of the best apartments in the palace were\r\nstrewed with rushes; and, in houses, where they could not get rushes,\r\nthey used straw.\r\n\r\n10. Henry the Third died about seven years after his restoration,\r\nin the year 1272, having reigned fifty-seven years; and, although\r\nthe news was sent to his son as soon as possible, it was nearly two\r\nyears before he returned to England; such was the difference between\r\ntravelling then and now; for the journey to and from the Holy Land\r\nmay now be accomplished in a few weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Edward the First was a much wiser and better prince than his\r\nfather, but he was too fond of war, and too anxious to be renowned as\r\na conqueror, which was the cause of the long wars in Scotland, for\r\nhis great ambition was to conquer that country.\r\n\r\n12. But, the first thing he thought of, when he came home, was to\r\nmake such regulations as were most likely to protect the people from\r\nrobbery; so he had watchmen and patrols appointed in all the cities,\r\nand ordered that nobody should be abroad in the streets of London,\r\nnor any taverns kept open, after the curfew bell had tolled.\r\n\r\n13. The curfew was instituted by William the Conqueror, to prevent\r\nfires, which were very frequent, when houses were in general built\r\nof wood, and thatched; so, when this bell tolled at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nthe people, for a long time after the conquest, were obliged to put\r\nout their fires and candles; but the custom of tolling the bell was\r\ncontinued after that of putting out fire and candle was done away\r\nwith, and even to this day, in many places.\r\n\r\n14. Edward the First took care that the magistrates should do their\r\nduty, and punished those who broke the laws, which the kings had been\r\nafraid to do in the last two reigns, because their lives would have\r\nbeen in danger if they had.\r\n\r\n15. I must also tell you that this wise monarch did not alter what\r\nthe Earl of Leicester had done about the parliament; but he made it\r\na rule that the people should continue to send their members, and\r\nevery freeholder of land in the counties, and, in general, all men,\r\nin the cities and burghs, who paid taxes, had a right to vote at the\r\nelection of members of parliament.\r\n\r\n16. I should be glad to have nothing to say about warfare in this\r\nreign; but the Scottish wars form so large a portion of the history\r\nof the times, that you ought to know something about them.\r\n\r\n17. First, however, the king invaded the northern part of Wales,\r\nwhich had never been conquered by the English, and was then governed\r\nby a prince, named Llewellyn.\r\n\r\n18. This chief made a gallant resistance, but he was killed, and the\r\nwhole country was then united to England, and afterwards, in the\r\nreign of Henry the Eighth, divided into shires.\r\n\r\n19. The queen, Eleanor, of Castile, Edward\xe2\x80\x99s first wife, went to\r\nvisit Wales soon afterwards, and her son Edward was born there, so\r\nthe king said he should be called prince of Wales, and that is the\r\nreason why the eldest son of the English sovereign has since had that\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n20. After this, there were a few years of peace, before the wars with\r\nScotland were begun; so I will fill up the time by saying a little\r\nabout the manners and customs of the English at this period.\r\n\r\n21. The nobles lived in, what we should think, a very rough way\r\nindeed. Their large comfortless rooms, and floors without carpets,\r\nunglazed windows, and clumsy furniture, would not suit our modern\r\nnotions, either of comfort or convenience.\r\n\r\n22. They had their dinner at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, in the\r\ngreat hall of the castle; lords, ladies, knights, esquires, priests,\r\ndependents, and strangers, all together; for, when there were\r\nno inns, it was usual for travellers to stop at any castle, or\r\nmonastery, on the road, where they were never refused lodging and\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n23. There were no table cloths, and the dishes and cups were mostly\r\nof wood, but they were well filled with meat, game, fish, or poultry,\r\nwhich, with bread and ale, constituted the rude, but substantial fare.\r\n\r\n24. The Baron, with his friends, sat at an upper table, which was\r\nserved with wine; and, sometimes he would have his hounds lying at\r\nhis feet, and his favorite hawk, upon a perch, beside him.\r\n\r\n25. The supper, at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, was just like the dinner, and these\r\nwere the only regular meals at that period.\r\n\r\n26. I said there were no inns in those days, which reminds me to\r\nspeak of the difficulty and danger of travelling. The roads were very\r\nbad and lonely, often running through forests and across wide heaths,\r\ninfested with robbers.\r\n\r\n27. Then there were no public conveyances of any kind, nor any way of\r\nmaking a journey, but on horseback, or on foot; and, as to stopping\r\nat the country towns, there was very little accommodation to be had\r\nthere, for they were poor places, the houses in them being very\r\nlittle better than wooden sheds.\r\n\r\n28. There were no shops, so that every thing was bought, as formerly,\r\nat the markets and fairs.\r\n\r\n29. A great many merchants, from London, France, and Flanders, used\r\nto bring goods to the fairs for sale, and they were obliged to pay\r\ntolls and duties to the lord of the manor, which came to a great deal\r\nof money, because they brought a quantity of valuable merchandise,\r\nas the nobles themselves purchased their wearing apparel, jewellery,\r\nspices, and many other commodities, at the fairs, which sometimes\r\nlasted fifteen days.\r\n\r\n30. The dress of the great nobility, in the fourteenth century, was\r\nvery handsome, for they wore mantles of satin or velvet, with borders\r\nworked in gold, over jackets highly embroidered; and their velvet\r\ncaps were often adorned with jewels.\r\n\r\n31. The middle classes wore close coats of cloth, with leather belts\r\nround the waist, such as the Blue-Coat Boys now wear, and they had\r\ntight pantaloons, short boots, and cloth caps.\r\n\r\n32. The clothing of the working people was made of very coarse wool,\r\nsometimes undyed, and all spun and woven at home by the women, who\r\nhad nothing else for their own wearing, as there were no cottons or\r\nstuffs made in England then, nor any of the nice comfortable things\r\nthat the poor people can get so cheap now.\r\n\r\n33. The country towns were at this period inhabited chiefly by free\r\nartisans, such as blacksmiths, carpenters, and others, of different\r\ntrades; but there were still a great many villeins and serfs, on all\r\nthe cultivated lands, for slavery was never abolished in England by\r\nany act of parliament, but gradually died away with the feudal laws.\r\n\r\n34. The armies were not raised then as they were at an earlier\r\nperiod, by feudal service, but soldiers were hired and paid by the\r\nday; but there was no standing army, as there is at present; for, as\r\nsoon as the wars were over, the men were all discharged, which was a\r\nbad thing, as it often happened they had no homes or employment to\r\nreturn to, and so formed themselves into bands of robbers.\r\n\r\n35. However, fighting men had plenty of occupation during the reign\r\nof Edward the First, of whose wars in Scotland I am now about to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n36. The king of Scotland died about this time, and as he left no\r\nson, and his grand-daughter and heiress, Margaret, died soon after,\r\nunmarried, there were two princes, who each thought he had a right\r\nto succeed to the throne; so they agreed to let the king of England\r\ndecide the dispute, which he readily took upon himself to do. One\r\nprince was named Robert Bruce, the other, John Baliol.\r\n\r\n37. Edward said Baliol ought to be king, and he was crowned\r\naccordingly; but the English monarch soon began to find fault with\r\nhim, and at last went to war, for he made up his mind to try to unite\r\nEngland and Scotland into one kingdom, and to be the king of both\r\ncountries himself; but he did not succeed, although he dethroned\r\nBaliol, and was at war with Scotland for nearly eleven years.\r\n\r\n38. I dare say you have heard of a renowned Scottish chief, called\r\nSir William Wallace. He fought bravely for his country in these wars,\r\nbut he was taken prisoner at the battle of Falkirk; and, I am sorry\r\nto say, king Edward was so cruel and unjust as to have his head cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\n39. But this did not put an end to the war, for another chief, Robert\r\nBruce, grandson of him before-mentioned, took the place of Wallace,\r\ngained several victories, and was crowned king.\r\n\r\n40. The two sovereigns then prepared for a long war, and Edward was\r\non his way to Scotland, with his army, when he was taken ill, and\r\ndied in the year 1307, having reigned thirty-four years.\r\n\r\n41. His son, Edward the Second, was so careless of every thing but\r\nhis own pleasure, that he neglected the affairs of both England and\r\nScotland, so that the Scots recovered all they had lost; and when,\r\nat last, the king was persuaded to renew the war, he met with such\r\na terrible defeat at the battle of Bannockburn, that the Scots are\r\nproud of it to this very day.\r\n\r\n42. There is nothing more worth telling about the reign of Edward\r\nthe Second, whose misconduct caused many of the barons to rebel, and\r\nhe was, at last, made prisoner by them, and cruelly murdered, in\r\nBerkeley castle, in 1327, having reigned about twenty years.\r\n\r\n43. His son, Edward the Third, was scarcely fifteen, at the time of\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s death; but he was a very clever prince, and soon began\r\nto manage the affairs of the country himself.\r\n\r\n44. He married a Flemish princess, named Philippa, who was much\r\nbeloved by the English people, as, indeed, she deserved to be, for\r\nshe was both good and beautiful, as well as one of the cleverest\r\nladies of her time, and she employed her talents in doing all the\r\ngood she could for England.\r\n\r\n45. She knew that the people of her own country, which was Flanders,\r\nhad grown rich by their trade and manufactures, so she did all in\r\nher power to increase the trade of England, and paid a number of\r\nFlemish weavers to come over here and settle at Norwich, that they\r\nmight improve the people there, in the art of making woollen cloth\r\nand stuffs, for which a manufactory had been established by Edward\r\nthe First.\r\n\r\n46. She also founded several schools, and was a friend to those who\r\ndistinguished themselves by their learning.\r\n\r\n47. I must not forget to tell you that Chaucer, the first great poet\r\nthat wrote in English, lived at this time, and received much kindness\r\nfrom the king and queen.\r\n\r\n48. The English language was now beginning to be spoken by the higher\r\nclasses, instead of French, and was not very unlike the English\r\nspoken now, as you might see, if you were to look at the poems\r\nwritten by Chaucer.\r\n\r\n49. Edward the Third was, unfortunately, as fond of war as his\r\ngrandfather. He renewed the war with Scotland, but his great wars\r\nwere in France, for his ambition was to be king of that country, and\r\nhe pretended he had a right to the throne, because his mother was\r\nthe sister of the late king.\r\n\r\n50. But the French thought otherwise, and chose another prince for\r\ntheir king, so Edward invaded France, where he commenced a long and\r\ndestructive war, which lasted nearly forty years, and was carried on,\r\nfor a great part of that time, by his eldest son, who was called the\r\nBlack Prince, because he wore black armour.\r\n\r\n51. He made great conquests in the south of France, and, at the\r\ncelebrated battle of Poictiers, took the French king prisoner, and\r\nbrought him to England, where he remained a captive for the rest of\r\nhis life, but was treated with so much kindness and respect, that he\r\nhad little to complain of but the loss of his liberty.\r\n\r\n52. The Black Prince was not only a brave warrior, but was a good and\r\nclever man; therefore, his death, which happened a few months before\r\nthat of his father, was a great grief to the English people.\r\n\r\n53. Edward the Third died in 1377, after a long reign of fifty years.\r\nHe had been a pretty good king, had made the people obey the laws,\r\nand, in general, observed them himself.\r\n\r\n54. When he wanted money for the French wars, he had allowed the\r\nvilleins and serfs, on his manors, or crown lands, to buy their\r\nfreedom, so that there were now, comparatively, but few of the lower\r\norders remaining in bondage; and the agricultural labourers were paid\r\nfor their labour, as well as the artisans and mechanics.\r\n\r\n55. Their wages were, in general, from twopence to threepence a\r\nday, but you must remember that twopence, at that time, was equal,\r\nin purchasing the necessaries of life, to about one shilling and\r\neightpence of our money, and would buy much more than sufficient food\r\nfor a whole family.\r\n\r\n56. They lived chiefly on meat, brown bread, and ale; for there were\r\nno vegetables for the table, cultivated by the people in England,\r\ntill the time of Henry the Eighth; nor any potatoes, till that of\r\nqueen Elizabeth; and then they were considered a dainty dish, and\r\nonly seen at the tables of very rich people.\r\n\r\n57. However, there were gardens, orchards, and vineyards, belonging\r\nto the monasteries, and to persons of high rank and fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1. Who succeeded king John?\r\n\r\n  2.

Richard the Second, the son of Edward, the Black Prince, was\r\nbut eleven years old when, by the death of his grandfather, he\r\nbecame king of England. His uncles governed the country till he was\r\nold enough to act for himself; but they did not teach him to be a\r\nwise, nor a just man, and this injustice was the cause of all his\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\n2. One of the first things he did on his own account, was to break a\r\npromise he made to the people; and this was how it happened. A new\r\ntax had caused great discontent among the labouring classes, and\r\ntheir unwillingness to pay it was increased by the insolence of the\r\ncollectors, who, one day, in the house of a man called Walter, or\r\nWat Tiler, behaved so ill to his daughter, that he gave one of them\r\na blow on the head with his hammer, which unluckily killed him.\r\n\r\n3. Now the neighbours knew that if Walter should be taken, he\r\nwould be put to death for the offence, and as they all had cause\r\nto complain of the tax-gatherers, they assembled in front of his\r\ncottage, and declared they would protect him.\r\n\r\n4. This was at Deptford, and they all proceeded to London, being\r\njoined by thousands of men from different towns, and a dreadful riot\r\nthere was; so that it was thought necessary for the king to take some\r\nmeans of pacifying the rebels.\r\n\r\n5. Accordingly he went, with the lord mayor and some nobles and\r\ngentlemen, to meet them in Smithfield, and whilst Tiler, their\r\nleader, was talking with the king, the mayor came behind him, and\r\nstruck him on the head with his mace, and stunned him, and he was\r\nkilled by Richard\xe2\x80\x99s party; and then the king, fearing the rioters\r\nwould kill him in return, asked them what they wanted, saying, he was\r\nready to do any thing that was right and just.\r\n\r\n6. They said they desired that the poll tax should be taken off;\r\nslavery and villeinage abolished by law; so that all who were still\r\nin bondage should be made free; and that the old feudal custom of\r\npaying duties on goods, at all the markets and fairs, should be done\r\naway with.\r\n\r\n7. All this Richard promised to do; but no sooner had the men\r\ndispersed and gone back to their homes, than he sent out a military\r\nforce to seize all who had been concerned in the rebellion; and I\r\ngrieve to say that, although he had given his word that they should\r\nall be pardoned, he ordered the judges to have every one of them\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\n8. After such conduct as this, you will not expect to hear much good\r\nof Richard the Second, whose selfish extravagance led him to do all\r\nkinds of unjust things, for the purpose of raising money to spend\r\non his own pleasures; so that it might truly be said that he was\r\nconstantly robbing his subjects; as, for instance, he once wanted\r\nto borrow a large sum of the citizens of London, which they would\r\nnot lend him, because they knew very well he would never return it;\r\nso he took away their charter, that is, the grant which gives them\r\nthe right to elect a lord mayor, and to manage the affairs of the\r\ncity independently of the king; and they were obliged to give him ten\r\ntimes as much to get it back again, as they had refused to lend.\r\n\r\n9. The citizens of London were very rich at this period, many of\r\nthem being great merchants, and it was in this reign that the famous\r\nWhittington was Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\n10. He had made a large fortune in the coal trade, which was then a\r\nnew branch of commerce, for coals were very little used for firing\r\ntill the time of Edward the Third.\r\n\r\n11. King Richard had unjustly banished his cousin Henry, Earl of\r\nHereford, and on the death of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father, the Duke of Lancaster,\r\nhad taken possession of his estates.\r\n\r\n12. This nobleman was a grandson of Edward the Third, and was much\r\nliked by the English, who would rather have had him for their king\r\nthan the unworthy sovereign they had got, although he would have had\r\nno right to the throne, even if Richard had been dead.\r\n\r\n13. However, he came back to England, and finding most of the nobles\r\nas well as the people willing to make him king, Richard was obliged\r\nto resign the crown, and was imprisoned in Pomfret castle, where\r\nit is supposed he died by unfair means; but as this is not quite\r\ncertain, we will hope it was not so. He had reigned twenty-two years,\r\nwhen he was deposed, in 1399.\r\n\r\n14. This usurpation of Henry the Fourth was the cause of the long\r\ncivil wars in England, called the Wars of the Roses, which began in\r\nthe time of Henry the Sixth, whose right to the throne was disputed,\r\nalthough his father and grandfather had been suffered to reign\r\nwithout opposition.\r\n\r\n15. Henry the Fourth was, on the whole, a popular monarch, and under\r\nhis government things went on pretty well with the generality of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n16. There was an insurrection in Wales, headed by a gentleman, named\r\nOwen Glendower, who wished to restore the Welsh to their former\r\nindependence, and to be their prince, as he was of the ancient royal\r\nfamily; and he was joined by the powerful Earl of Northumberland, and\r\nhis son Henry Percy, better known by the name of Hotspur, who was\r\none of the bravest knights of the age.\r\n\r\n17. These noblemen had a quarrel with the king, and wanted to depose\r\nhim; but he gained a victory over them in a battle fought near\r\nShrewsbury, where Hotspur was killed. These events are not of much\r\nimportance, but I tell them because when you hear any celebrated\r\ncharacters spoken of, you ought to know who they were, and when they\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n18. The prince of Wales, afterwards Henry the Fifth, was also\r\ncelebrated for his valour, but not for his good behaviour in his\r\nyouth; for his conduct was sometimes so disgraceful that his father\r\nwas quite ashamed of him, and nobody would have supposed he was the\r\nson of a king.\r\n\r\n19. One thing he used to do was to go out at night, with some idle\r\ncompanions, and rob people on the highway, for amusement; yet he had\r\nnot a bad disposition, for once one of the judges sent him to prison\r\nfor trying to rescue one of his wicked companions; and he not only\r\nsubmitted to the punishment, but when he came to be king, he treated\r\nthat judge with great respect and attention, because he knew he was a\r\njust man, and would punish the rich as well as the poor, if they did\r\nwrong. King Henry the Fourth died in 1413, in the fourteenth year of\r\nhis reign.\r\n\r\n20. Henry the Fifth is famed as the conqueror of France. He went to\r\nwar with that country, on the same pretext that Edward the Third did\r\nbefore; and with better success, for the French king was at last glad\r\nto make peace by agreeing that Henry should be king of France after\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\n21. The greatest victory gained by the English, was at the battle of\r\nAgincourt. King Henry married the French king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, but he died\r\nsoon afterwards, in 1422, having reigned nine years; and leaving an\r\ninfant son; and in a little while the king of France died too, and he\r\nalso left a son.\r\n\r\n22. Then there was a dispute which of these princes should be king of\r\nFrance, and a new war was begun which lasted many years, during which\r\nthe English lost all that the armies of Henry the Fifth had won.\r\n\r\n23. In the mean time the young king, Henry the Sixth, grew up so\r\nweak in mind and sickly in body, that he was not able to govern the\r\ncountry; therefore, his ministers and the queen, a French princess,\r\nnamed Margaret of Anjou, had to manage every thing for him.\r\n\r\n24. But many people did not like the queen, and began to say that\r\nher husband had no right to the throne as his grandfather was a\r\nusurper; but that Richard, Duke of York, ought to be king of England;\r\nwhile others said that, as the Parliament had consented to let the\r\nfamily of the Duke of Lancaster reign, it was lawful for them to keep\r\nthe crown; and that although king Henry was not fit for a ruler, the\r\nrights of his son, prince Edward, ought to be protected.\r\n\r\n25. The Duke of York was then governor of Ireland, but when he heard\r\nof these disputes, he came back, and was placed at the head of the\r\ngovernment here, instead of the queen.\r\n\r\n26. I think you will now quite understand why there was a civil war\r\nin England. Every nobleman in the country took one side or the other,\r\nand the friends of the Duke of York wore a white rose or ribbon\r\nrosette; while those who supported the king, or House of Lancaster,\r\nwore a crimson one; as people now wear different colored ribbons at\r\nan election, to show which party they belong to; and this is why\r\nthese wars are called the Wars of the Roses.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

The civil wars may be said to have lasted thirty years, from the\r\nfirst battle at St. Alban\xe2\x80\x99s, in 1455, to the battle of Bosworth,\r\nin 1485; for although there were intervals of peace, the quarrel\r\nbetween the house of York and Lancaster was not finally settled\r\ntill the two families were united by the marriage of Henry the\r\nSeventh, who was heir of the House of Lancaster, with Elizabeth, the\r\ngrand-daughter of Richard, Duke of York, and heiress of that family.\r\n\r\n2. During that thirty years, the country was, as you may suppose, in\r\na very unhappy condition. Every Baron wanted to collect as many men\r\naround him as he could, to defend his castle in case of siege; so the\r\ncountrymen left their rural labors and went to enlist in the service\r\nof this or that nobleman, because they were sure of getting plenty to\r\neat and drink.\r\n\r\n3. Thus the castle halls were crowded, but the fields were left\r\nwithout sufficient laborers to plough and sow them, consequently the\r\ncrops were generally bad, and bread was at times, so dear, that many\r\npoor families could get none at all, but were obliged to eat herbs\r\nand berries that they found in the woods, which did not nourish them,\r\nso that numbers died of want.\r\n\r\n4. Many battles were fought in different parts of England, and the\r\nqueen was present at some of them, for it was she who conducted the\r\nwar, as the king was incapable of so much exertion, and Margaret\r\ncould not bear to see her young son Edward deprived of his birthright.\r\n\r\n5. Three victories had been gained by the Duke of York, when he was\r\nkilled at the battle of Wakefield; but this event did not put an\r\nend to the contest, for his son Edward, who succeeded to his title,\r\ncontinued the war and, in the end, became king of England, while poor\r\nking Henry was kept a prisoner in the Tower, where he died in 1471.\r\n\r\n6. Edward owed his success chiefly to the Earl of Warwick, the\r\nrichest and most powerful nobleman in England, and considered as the\r\nlast of the great feudal Barons, for it is said that he maintained no\r\nless than thirty thousand people at his own expense, who were ready\r\nto devote their lives to his service.\r\n\r\n7. He had a great many castles in different parts of England, and a\r\nnoble mansion in Warwick lane, London, which still bears that name,\r\nalthough it presents a very different appearance from what it did\r\nwhen this mighty Earl lived there like a sovereign prince, and the\r\nplace was crowded with his armed retainers.\r\n\r\n8. Edward had been very well received by the citizens of London, and\r\ncrowned, with their consent, long before the death of king Henry.\r\n\r\n9. Two battles were fought soon after his accession to the throne,\r\none at Towton the other at Hexham; and it was after the latter,\r\nthat a story is told how queen Margaret wandered about in a forest\r\nwith her little boy, till they were both half dead with hunger and\r\nfatigue, when she met with a robber, and instead of trying to avoid\r\nhim, told him who she was, and begged he would protect her child.\r\n\r\n10. The man took them to a cave, and gave them food and shelter,\r\nuntil he found an opportunity of getting them on board a vessel that\r\nwas going to Scotland.\r\n\r\n11. People were now in hopes there would be peace; but the new\r\nsovereign was so unwise as to quarrel with the Earl of Warwick, who\r\nbecame his enemy, and resolved to deprive him of the crown he had\r\nhelped him to win.\r\n\r\n12. Then the war was begun again, and went on for several years\r\nlonger, till Warwick was killed at the battle of Barnet, on Easter\r\nSunday, 1471, just ten years after the battle of Towton.\r\n\r\n13. On the day of this battle, queen Margaret, and her son, prince\r\nEdward, then a youth of eighteen, landed in England, for they had\r\nlived in France some years, and were sadly grieved at the news of\r\nWarwick\xe2\x80\x99s defeat and death; but as they had a great many friends,\r\nthe queen determined upon trying another battle, which was a great\r\npity, for both herself and her son were made prisoners, and the young\r\nprince was killed in king Edward\xe2\x80\x99s tent, for making a spirited answer\r\nto some insulting question put to him by the haughty monarch.\r\n\r\n14. The miserable mother was sent to the Tower, where her husband\r\nhad just died; but she was afterwards released, and ransomed by her\r\nfather; and she returned to live with him in France, her native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n15. And now, that we have done with the wars, we may begin to think\r\nof something more pleasant. Have you ever heard it was in the reign\r\nof Edward the Fourth that books were first printed in England?\r\n\r\n16. The art of printing, which enables us to have so many nice books\r\nto instruct and amuse us, had lately been invented in Germany, and\r\nwas brought here by an English merchant, named William Caxton, who\r\nwent to Cologne, on purpose to learn how to print, and when he came\r\nback, he set up a printing-press in Westminster Abbey, which, at that\r\ntime, was a monastery.\r\n\r\n17. We ought to be very much obliged to the clever person that\r\ninvented printing; for only think how very ignorant we should be,\r\nand how much pleasure we should lose, if there were no books to tell\r\nus any thing.\r\n\r\n18. There were books, certainly, before that time; but they were\r\nall written, and it took so long to copy them, that they were very\r\nexpensive, so that none but very rich people could have even a few\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n19. Printed books were also, for a long time, much too dear to be in\r\ngeneral use, but people of rank soon began to be much better educated\r\nthan in former times, and their habits and manners became much\r\nimproved in consequence.\r\n\r\n20. Then a great many of the old Norman castles had been destroyed\r\nin the wars, which put an end, after a time, to the customs of\r\nchivalry; and the nobles, instead of sending their sons to be brought\r\nup for warlike knights, sent them to Oxford, or Cambridge, to become\r\nscholars; or to Eton College, which had been founded by Henry the\r\nSixth.\r\n\r\n21. King Edward died in 1483, when his eldest son, who is called\r\nEdward the Fifth, although he never was really king, was only\r\nthirteen years old; and he, and his younger brother, the Duke of\r\nYork, were under the guardianship of their uncle Richard, Duke of\r\nGloucester, who was a very bad man.\r\n\r\n22. Instead of protecting the fatherless children entrusted to his\r\ncare, he only thought how he might take advantage of their youth to\r\nobtain the crown himself; so he sent them both to the Tower, but not\r\nas prisoners, for it was then used occasionally as a royal residence,\r\nespecially in times of public disturbances; so Richard told the\r\npeople the boys would be safe there; but in a little while it was\r\nreported that they were dead, and it was thought he had caused them\r\nto be murdered, which was most likely the truth, although some people\r\nthink they were not put to death, but were kept there as prisoners\r\nfor some years.\r\n\r\n23. Richard the Third was not a very bad king, for he made some\r\nlaws that were very useful to the merchants who traded with foreign\r\ncountries, and he was the first who thought of having postmen, or\r\ncouriers, to carry letters, so that, wicked as he was, we cannot say\r\nhe did no good as a sovereign.\r\n\r\n24. The post was, at first, only for government letters, and it was\r\na long time before any arrangements were made for private persons to\r\ncorrespond by the same means; but this was done by degrees, and in\r\nthe time of Oliver Cromwell, the General Post Office was established,\r\nwhen everybody had the benefit of this excellent institution, which\r\nadds so much to people\xe2\x80\x99s happiness; for who could possibly be happy\r\nnow, if they could not hear from their absent friends?\r\n\r\n25. Richard the Third reigned only two years, for he was disliked by\r\nthe nobility, and a conspiracy was formed against him by the friends\r\nof the House of Lancaster, who were desirous of placing on the throne\r\nthe heir of that family, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond.\r\n\r\n26. This young nobleman was living in exile, at the time, in France.\r\nBut he was soon informed of what was going on, and told the French\r\nking, who lent him forty ships, and about five thousand soldiers,\r\nwith which he sailed directly for England, where he found friends\r\nready to join him with more troops.\r\n\r\n27. The battle of Bosworth was fought on the 22nd of August, 1485,\r\nwhen Richard was killed, and the conqueror proclaimed king on the\r\nfield; and thus ended the Wars of the Roses.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

Henry the Seventh was not an amiable man, but he had many\r\nqualities that were good and useful in a sovereign, and the country\r\nprospered greatly under his government.\r\n\r\n2. One of the conditions on which he succeeded to the throne, was\r\nthat he should marry the princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward\r\nthe Fourth, and thus secure peace by uniting the families of York\r\nand Lancaster:--the princess Elizabeth was a lady much beloved by\r\nevery body, and her many acts of benevolence were long remembered in\r\nEngland, so that she was generally called the good queen Bess.\r\n\r\n3. The king wished to increase the wealth and prosperity of the\r\nnation, and he took the best means of doing so by promoting commerce.\r\nHe made commercial treaties, that is, agreements about trade, with\r\nforeign princes, by which he obtained many advantages for the English\r\nmerchants, just as our government has lately made a treaty with the\r\nemperor of China, about our trade in his country.\r\n\r\n4. No English ship had ever been to China then, nor even to India;\r\nand America had not yet been discovered; but in the time of Henry\r\nthe Seventh, the Spaniards and Portuguese made longer voyages than\r\nhad ever been made before, and the celebrated Christopher Columbus,\r\nwhom I dare say you have often heard of, found out by study, that\r\nthere was an unknown land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nand although people laughed at him, he at last persuaded the king\r\nand queen of Spain to let him have ships, and sailors, and money, to\r\ngo in search of it, so he was the first that found out the way to\r\nAmerica, which, for a long time, was called the New World.\r\n\r\n5. Soon after this, the Portuguese found out the way to India by sea;\r\nand then the English began to make voyages of discovery also, and\r\nto find that the world had more countries in it than they had ever\r\ndreamed of before.\r\n\r\n6. Maps and charts, which had been known to the Greeks and Romans,\r\nnow began to be much improved, though they were still incorrect, as\r\nyou may suppose.\r\n\r\n7. However, all these new discoveries, together with the invention\r\nof printing, made people think more about learning, and less about\r\nfighting than they used to do; especially as the nobility were\r\nbeginning to live more in the way they do now, and to have handsome\r\nhouses in London, instead of living always in their gloomy old\r\ncastles.\r\n\r\n8. Their domestics were no longer slaves, but hired servants; their\r\ntenants were not villeins, but free farmers, who paid rent for their\r\nland; and the poor peasantry, no longer in bondage, were at liberty\r\nto go where they pleased, and were paid for their daily labour.\r\n\r\n9. You remember that in the feudal times all the land in the country\r\nbelonged to the king, the nobles, the knights, and the bishops, and\r\nabbots.\r\n\r\n10. But Edward the First made a law in favour of the sale and\r\npurchase of all lands except those held immediately of the king; and\r\nEdward the Third gave his own vassals leave to sell their estates.\r\n\r\n11. Other laws were afterwards made, by which landed property was\r\nmade liable to seizure for debt, and might be given by will, or sold\r\nat the pleasure of the owner. And Henry the Seventh, by another law,\r\nfurther encouraged the sale of land, and the consequent division of\r\nlarge estates.\r\n\r\n12. Then many of the nobles, who had more land than they wanted, sold\r\nsome of it to wealthy merchants and others, who built large mansions,\r\nto which they often gave their own family name, as for instance, if\r\nthe name of the proprietor happened to be Burton, he would probably\r\ncall his residence Burton Hall.\r\n\r\n13. These country gentlemen formed quite a new class of people in\r\nEngland, and they have ever since that time continued to increase in\r\nwealth, rank, and importance.\r\n\r\n14. A strange thing happened in the reign of Henry the Seventh, which\r\nhas made some people think the sons of Edward the Fourth were not\r\nput to death in the Tower, as is generally believed, but you shall\r\nhear the story.\r\n\r\n15. A young man, called Perkin Warbeck, came to Ireland from\r\nFlanders, and declared he was the younger of those two princes, and\r\nthe lawful heir to the throne, as his brother was dead.\r\n\r\n16. He told a wonderful tale, how he had escaped from the Tower,\r\nand related many adventures which he said had befallen him; so the\r\nIrish people said they would fight for him, and try to take the crown\r\nfrom king Henry; but as they could not raise a sufficient force by\r\nthemselves, Warbeck applied to the king of France, who also promised\r\nto help him, and then he went to the Duchess of Burgundy, who was\r\nEdward the Fourth\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and, strange to say, that lady declared\r\nshe believed the young man was her brother\xe2\x80\x99s son, and persuaded the\r\nFlemings to lend him their aid.\r\n\r\n17. But the king of France changed his mind; and made a treaty of\r\npeace with king Henry, who ordered the English merchants not to carry\r\non any trade with Flanders while the Flemings continued to favour the\r\ncause of Perkin Warbeck, so they deserted him too.\r\n\r\n18. I have not the room to tell you the rest of his adventures, but\r\nthey ended in his being taken prisoner by the king, who had him put\r\nto death as a traitor. Henry the Seventh reigned twenty-four years,\r\nand was succeeded in 1509 by his son, Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\n19. The young king was married to Catharine of Arragon, the daughter\r\nof the king of Spain, a beautiful and talented woman, who deserved a\r\nbetter husband, for Henry was a sad tyrant in his family, as well as\r\nover the nation.\r\n\r\n20. The greatest man in the kingdom next to the king, was his\r\nminister, Cardinal Wolsey, who governed the country for many years,\r\nand was so rich, that he not only lived in as much splendour as the\r\nking, but he built the palaces of Hampton-court and Whitehall, and\r\nfounded the College of Christ Church at Oxford.\r\n\r\n21. A Cardinal is a priest of high dignity in the Catholic Church,\r\nbeing next in rank to the Pope.\r\n\r\n22. Wolsey was clever and learned; but he was very proud, so he had\r\nmany enemies, and at last fell into disgrace with the king, and died\r\nof grief.\r\n\r\n23. Soon after this Henry chose to be separated from his good wife,\r\nCatharine, because he had seen a young lady named Anna Boleyn, whom\r\nhe thought he should like to marry; so he sent the queen and his\r\ndaughter Mary, away from court, and made Anna Boleyn queen; but he\r\nsoon began to dislike her, and said she had done some very wicked\r\nthings, as an excuse for sending her to the Tower, where he had her\r\nhead cut off; and then he married another young lady, named Jane\r\nSeymour, who soon died. She left a little baby, who was king Edward\r\nthe Sixth; and Anna Boleyn also had a baby, who was queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n24. I must now tell you of a great change made by Henry the Eighth,\r\nwith regard to religion, and called the Reformation.\r\n\r\n25. The church of England had, till this period, been the same as\r\nthat of Rome, and the people were Roman Catholics; but there were a\r\ngood many people in Germany, and in England also, who thought that\r\nsome of the forms of the Catholic religion were not right, and ought\r\nto be altered, and these persons were called reformers, and all who\r\nadopted their opinions took the name of Protestants, because they\r\nprotested against certain things.\r\n\r\n26. Now Henry the Eighth had a disagreement with the Pope, about his\r\nsecond marriage; so he determined to abolish the Catholic religion,\r\nto seize on and destroy the monasteries and nunneries, and to have\r\nProtestant clergymen to preach and read the prayers in the churches.\r\n\r\n27. It would be too long a story to tell you how he accomplished all\r\nthis; but it was done. There were nearly a thousand religious houses,\r\nthat is, convents, abbeys, and priories, in England, inhabited by\r\nmonks and nuns, clerks and friars, of different orders, who had no\r\nother homes, nor any means of living, but on the property of the\r\nestablishments to which they belonged; and these were all suppressed,\r\ntogether with many colleges and hospitals, which also supported a\r\ngreat many poor people.\r\n\r\n28. The poor were very sorry the convents were broken up, for they\r\nhad been accustomed to go there when they were in distress, for food,\r\nclothing, or medicine; and now they did not know where to get relief,\r\nas there were no workhouses; the hospitals, and all other charitable\r\ninstitutions, except some alms-houses, having been destroyed; nor was\r\nit till almost the middle of the reign of queen Elizabeth that any\r\nprovision was made by law for the destitute poor.\r\n\r\n29. The manufactures of England were now fast increasing.\r\nManchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield, were beginning to be known\r\nas manufacturing towns; the first, for woollens and cottons; the\r\nothers, for cutlery and hardware.\r\n\r\n30. Pewter plates and dishes were made in large quantities, for they\r\nwere now used in the most respectable families instead of wood; hats\r\nwere also made in England in this reign; and a clock, the first ever\r\nmanufactured in this country.\r\n\r\n31. But nothing was more useful than the improvements made in\r\ngardening, for which we are indebted to the Flemings and Dutch, who\r\nwere the best gardeners in Europe, and who brought here many kinds of\r\nvegetables for the table, such as cabbages, lettuces, &c., and many\r\nfruits that had not been cultivated in England since the time of the\r\nRomans, particularly cherries and currants.\r\n\r\n32. Potatoes were not known until the reign of queen Elizabeth, when\r\nSir Walter Raleigh brought some from America, and planted them, first\r\nin Ireland, little thinking, perhaps, that this root would, at a\r\nfuture time, be almost the only food of the Irish people.\r\n\r\n33. Henry the Eighth had three more wives, Anne of Cleves, whom he\r\ndivorced; Catherine Howard, whom he had beheaded, like poor Anna\r\nBoleyn; and Catherine Parr, who outlived him.\r\n\r\n34. He reigned thirty-eight years, and was succeeded by his son,\r\nEdward the Sixth, who was only nine years old, and died before he\r\nwas sixteen; so that he can scarcely be reckoned among the kings of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n35. He was a pious and amiable prince, fond of learning, and\r\nextremely charitable. He founded St. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, for the sick\r\npoor; and Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital and School, for the education of boys who\r\nhad lost their fathers.\r\n\r\n36. He had a cousin, Lady Jane Grey, whom he was very fond of, for\r\nshe was about his own age, gentle and beautiful, and being fond of\r\nstudy, was educated with him; so that it was no wonder he liked her.\r\n\r\n37. They were both Protestants; but Edward\xe2\x80\x99s eldest sister, Mary, was\r\na Catholic; and as some of the great noblemen were Protestants, they\r\ndid not like to have a Catholic queen; so when the young king was\r\ndying, they persuaded him to make a will, leaving the crown to Lady\r\nJane Grey, which was not right, because his father had ordered, and\r\nthe parliament confirmed his will, that, if he died, Mary was to be\r\nqueen. Edward the Sixth died in the seventh year of his reign.\r\n\r\n38. Lady Jane was married to young Lord Guildford Dudley, and knew\r\nnothing about king Edward\xe2\x80\x99s will till after he was dead, when her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s father told her she was to be queen.\r\n\r\n39. At first she refused, but was, at length, persuaded or compelled\r\nto allow herself to be proclaimed; and very unhappy it made her, so\r\nthat she was very glad, at the end of ten days, to give up the title\r\nof queen to her who had a better right to it.\r\n\r\n40. Now Mary was a woman of a morose temper; and, unfortunately, at\r\nthat time, and long afterwards, people who differed in religious\r\nopinions were very cruel to each other; so she would not forgive poor\r\nLady Jane Grey, but sent her and her husband to the Tower, where they\r\nwere both beheaded.\r\n\r\n41. The reign of queen Mary lasted only five years, and there is\r\nlittle to tell about it, except that she did all she could to\r\nrestore the Roman Catholic religion, and re-established some of the\r\nmonasteries; but they were suppressed again, after her death, by her\r\nsister Elizabeth, who had been brought up in the Protestant faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  2.

Elizabeth is one of the most celebrated of our sovereigns, for she\r\nwas a remarkably clever woman, although, like her father, she was\r\nharsh and tyrannical.\r\n\r\n2. It was a merry day in England when she was crowned, for great\r\nnumbers of the people had not liked queen Mary. The citizens of\r\nLondon testified their joy by decorating the outsides of their houses\r\nwith draperies of silk and satin; and by having shows and pageants in\r\nthe streets, as was customary, at that time, on all joyful occasions.\r\n\r\n3. In one place, a fountain ran with wine; in another, a boy, dressed\r\nto represent an angel with wings, descended from the top of an arch,\r\nas the queen\xe2\x80\x99s chariot was passing under, and presented her with a\r\nbible; then was drawn up again by a cord, to look as if he flew away;\r\nand there were many other things of the same kind, which I have not\r\nroom to tell of.\r\n\r\n4. The ladies and gentlemen who attended the queeen rode on\r\nhorseback, for coaches were not used in England till some years\r\nafterwards, when a gentleman, from Holland, brought a carriage over\r\nhere, and then the English soon began to build coaches, and ladies\r\nof rank left off riding on horses, as they used to do, seated on a\r\npillion, behind their husbands.\r\n\r\n5. Elizabeth was a good queen in many respects, for she was a friend\r\nto learning, commerce, and all useful arts; and she chose able\r\nministers, who ruled the country with wisdom and prudence; but she\r\nbehaved very cruelly about religion, for although numbers of the\r\npeople were still Catholics, she made a law that everybody should go\r\nto Protestant churches; and those who did not were put in prison, or\r\nmade to pay such large sums of money, that they were quite ruined.\r\n\r\n6. In other countries, particularly the Netherlands, the Protestants\r\nwere as ill-treated as the Catholics were here, so that a great many\r\nof them came to England, and were very useful in teaching the English\r\nseveral arts and manufactures they did not know before.\r\n\r\n7. Pins, needles, and paper, were now first made in England, and the\r\ncotton and other factories were greatly improved, so that there was\r\nmore employment for the working classes.\r\n\r\n8. Then workhouses were established for the destitute, and all\r\nhouseholders, for the first time, were obliged to pay a tax, called\r\nthe poor rate, to support and find the poor in food and clothes, so\r\nthat they might not be driven, by want, to beg or steal.\r\n\r\n9. The middle classes became more wealthy, and lived in better style\r\nthan at any former period, especially the citizens of London, many\r\nof whom were rich merchants, living like noblemen, and among these\r\nwas Sir Thomas Gresham, who built the first Royal Exchange, at his\r\nown expense, and gave a grand dinner there to the queen, in the year\r\n1570.\r\n\r\n10. English merchants now began to think of trading to the East\r\nIndies: but as it required a great deal of money to fit out ships,\r\nto make so long a voyage, for it took about four times as long then\r\nas it does now, a number of rich merchants joined together, and for\r\na sum of money, obtained a charter from the queen, which made it\r\nunlawful for any other persons to carry on any trade with that part\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n11. It is very interesting to read how this East India Company first\r\nwere only permitted just to land in India, and buy and sell a few\r\ngoods; then, how they obtained permission of the emperor, for there\r\nwas an emperor of India then, to build some warehouses on the sea\r\ncoast, and form a little settlement, called a factory; then how they\r\ngradually established more factories, and took soldiers to protect\r\nthem, and gained possession of lands, where they built towns, so that\r\nmany English families went to live there.\r\n\r\n12. Such was the beginning of the British empire in India; and, I\r\ndare say, that if the emperor could have foreseen the consequences,\r\nhe would not have consented to have an English factory built on his\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n13. In the reign of Elizabeth, Captain Francis Drake made a voyage\r\nall round the world, though he was not the first navigator who did\r\nso, but he was the first English one.\r\n\r\n14. This was a grand exploit, as few people had believed, then, that\r\nit was possible, or that the world was really a round body; so you\r\nsee how these voyages tended to increase knowledge, as well as to\r\nimprove commerce.\r\n\r\n15. When Drake returned, the queen went to dine with him on board his\r\nship, and made him a knight, after which he was called Sir Francis\r\nDrake, and he soon became an admiral.\r\n\r\n16. In the mean time, several voyages had been made to America, and\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, who was one of the great men of the time, had\r\ntaken possession of a tract of land for the queen of England, which\r\nhe called Virginia, and it still bears that name.\r\n\r\n17. The Europeans behaved very unjustly about America, for although\r\nthe natives were savages, they had no right to take away their lands.\r\n\r\n18. But they did so in every place they went to; and if they were\r\nSpaniards, they set up the Spanish flag, and the commander of the\r\nship said, \xe2\x80\x9cI take this country for the king of Spain;\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nwould fight with the poor natives, and kill them or drive them away;\r\nand, I am sorry to say, the English used to act much in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n19. The Spaniards who had taken some of the West India Islands, and\r\nsettled colonies in South America, wanted slaves to work in the gold\r\nmines, and their sugar plantations; so an English captain took out\r\nsome ships to Africa, and carried off a great many negroes, whom\r\nhe sold in the West Indies, for a large price; and from that time\r\nthis trade was carried on to a great extent, and was permitted, by\r\ngovernment, until the beginning of the present century.\r\n\r\n20. But we must now think of what was going on in England. Elizabeth\r\nhad a cousin, named Mary, who was queen of Scotland, and was next\r\nheir to the English crown.\r\n\r\n21. She was young and beautiful, and had been married to the king of\r\nFrance, who was now dead; so she had returned to Scotland, and, after\r\na time, married lord Darnley, and had a son, who was our king James\r\nthe First.\r\n\r\n22. Lord Darnley was murdered, and Mary married another lord, who was\r\ndisliked by the Scots, so that there was a civil war, and she was\r\nobliged to resign the crown, and after much ill-treatment, escaped to\r\nEngland, and begged the protection of queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n23. Now the queen had always been jealous of her, and she was now\r\ncruel enough to shut her up in a castle, and, after keeping her a\r\nprisoner for eighteen years, in different places, gave orders for\r\nher execution, and the unfortunate queen of Scots was beheaded in\r\nFotheringay castle.\r\n\r\n24. Soon after this event, news arrived that a large fleet was\r\ncoming to invade England. The king of Spain, Philip the Second, had\r\nbeen married to our queen Mary; and had offered his hand to queen\r\nElizabeth, but she had resolved not to marry at all, and at any rate,\r\nshe would not have had Philip, for she did not like him.\r\n\r\n25. He was, therefore, offended; and was also angry because the queen\r\nhad been kind to the Protestants who had fled to England from the\r\nNetherlands, for he was king of those countries as well as of Spain;\r\nand her admirals having attacked some of his settlements in America,\r\nhe determined to invade England, and make himself king there too, if\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\n26. He got ready the largest fleet that was ever known, and called\r\nit the Invincible Armada; but it did not prove to be invincible,\r\nalthough the English had but a very small navy at that time, not more\r\nthan fifteen ships of war; but the merchants lent their ships, and\r\nmanned them at their own expense; and people of all classes gave\r\nmoney to pay soldiers, to defend the country, in case the Spaniards\r\nshould effect a landing.\r\n\r\n27. But they never did land; for the English vessels, though so much\r\nsmaller than Spanish ships, were lighter, and more manageable, and\r\nkept them from coming near the shore; and when they anchored off\r\nCalais, the English admiral sent fire ships among them, and burnt\r\nsome of them, which created such terror, that they sailed away as\r\nfast as they could, some one way and some another, and the English\r\nships chased them and disabled a great many; while others were\r\nwrecked by a violent storm; and thus the Armada was nearly destroyed.\r\n\r\n28. Small handbills were printed and sent about the country, to let\r\nthe people know that the danger was over.\r\n\r\n29. Many more books were now published, and there were many clever\r\nauthors in this reign, especially Shakespeare, who wrote a number of\r\nbeautiful plays.\r\n\r\n30. The queen was a great admirer of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s plays, and used\r\nto go to see them acted; but the theatres were then not much better\r\nthan the shows at a country fair, and the performance was in the day\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n31. People of fashion, in those days, dined at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock; the\r\nmerchants and tradespeople, at twelve; and laborers, at one; and all\r\npublic amusements were between dinner and supper, which was taken\r\nabout six.\r\n\r\n32. These amusements did not show very good taste, for gentlemen and\r\nladies of rank used to go and see cock fighting, and bull and bear\r\nbaiting, which are cruel disgusting exhibitions, and I only mention\r\nthem to show you the difference between the manners at that time and\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n33. I will now give you an idea what kind of dress people used to\r\nwear in the time of queen Elizabeth. The gowns were open before,\r\nwith a stiff bodice, just like a pair of stays, laced in front, and\r\na large ruff round the neck.\r\n\r\n34. In the street, most ladies used to wear a little black velvet\r\nmask, and shoes with such high heels they could scarcely walk in\r\nthem. Gentlemen wore short jackets, reaching a little below the\r\nwaist, with a belt and sword, a cloak, and a high-crowned hat.\r\n\r\n35. One great improvement was made in dress in this reign, by the\r\ninvention of stockings, which, for a long time, were all knitted;\r\nbut they were found much more convenient than the cloth hose, that\r\neverybody used to wear, till then.\r\n\r\n36. Queen Elizabeth died, after a long, prosperous and peaceful\r\nreign, of forty-five years, in 1603, having named for her successor,\r\nher cousin, James Stuart, king of Scotland: and thus the two kingdoms\r\nof England and Scotland came to be united, and took the name of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

FROM THE UNION TO THE REVOLUTION.--1603 TO 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROMWELL EXPELLING THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.]\r\n\r\n1. The people of Scotland did not like the union of the two kingdoms,\r\nat first, because the king and many of the nobility went away to\r\nlive in London, which, as there was little trade, left Scotland in\r\na very poor condition; and it was a long time, indeed, not before\r\nthe people had experienced the great benefits of British trade and\r\ncommerce, that they began to feel as a part of the English nation;\r\nbut now that the English and Scots have become like one people, it is\r\ncertainly much happier and better for both.\r\n\r\n2. James had not been king two years, when a conspiracy was formed\r\nagainst the government, called the Gunpowder Plot. I cannot tell you\r\nfor certain by whom it was contrived, but it was a wicked scheme\r\nto blow up the houses of parliament, when the king, and most of\r\nthe lords and commons were there assembled; but, happily, it was\r\ndiscovered a short time before the meeting of parliament, and all the\r\ngreatest men in the country were saved from a dreadful death.\r\n\r\n3. James the First was not a good king, for he had a mistaken\r\nnotion that a king ought to do whatever he liked; and that, if he\r\nwanted money he had a right to make new taxes, without the consent\r\nof parliament, and, in fact, he thought it unnecessary to have any\r\nparliament at all, and he taught his son Charles to be of the same\r\nopinion, which was the cause of that monarch\xe2\x80\x99s untimely fate, and\r\nthe civil wars that you will presently read about.\r\n\r\n4. In the reign of James the First, there were such severe laws\r\nagainst those who did not conform to the church of England, that\r\nhundreds of people emigrated to America, and settled themselves\r\nin colonies in a wild country, where at first they suffered many\r\nhardships and privations; but these colonies, and others, afterwards\r\nformed, gradually improved, till they became large flourishing\r\nstates, now called the United States of America.\r\n\r\n5. James the First reigned twenty-two years, and was succeeded, in\r\nthe year 1625, by his son Charles, whose bad education led to all the\r\nmiseries of a long civil war, and to misfortunes that fell upon his\r\nown head.\r\n\r\n6. The quarrels between Charles and the parliament, arose from his\r\ntaking upon himself the power of raising money by taxes, without the\r\nconsent of the House of Commons; and in other things he chose to act\r\nby his own will, although it might be quite contrary to the laws of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n7. Many people were put in prison because they would not lend him\r\nmoney when he desired it; and, at last, he dissolved the parliament\r\naltogether, and said he would govern without one, and then the\r\npeople had no protection from his tyranny.\r\n\r\n8. Those who were treated the worst were the Puritans, a religious\r\nsect, whose form of worship was very similar to that of the present\r\nScottish Church, which is different from the English, as they have\r\nno bishops, do not use prayer books, and have particular rules about\r\nchoosing their own clergymen.\r\n\r\n9. The Scots who hold these opinions are called Presbyterians. The\r\nPuritans dressed very plainly, like quakers, and had their hair cut\r\nclose, and on that account they obtained the name of Roundheads; and\r\nthose who took part against the king in the civil war, generally\r\nadopted that fashion, and were distinguished by that name.\r\n\r\n10. After a time, the king began to find that, if he continued to\r\ngovern by himself, there would certainly be a serious rebellion; so\r\nhe consented to have a new parliament, and there was an election\r\ndirectly, and as many of the new members were Puritans, they perhaps\r\nwanted the king to yield too much, and thus provoked him not to give\r\nup so much as he ought.\r\n\r\n11. I cannot tell how this might be; but a great many people at\r\nlength began to think it would be better to have a Republic, that is,\r\na government without a king, and many of the Puritans were of that\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n12. Charles had undoubtedly brought all his troubles upon himself,\r\nbut it was now evident he must either give up his authority as\r\na sovereign, or fight to maintain it; so he chose the latter\r\nalternative, and a war was commenced between the king and the\r\nparliament. Each party raised a large army.\r\n\r\n13. The queen, who was sister to the French king, went to France, to\r\nraise money to pay soldiers to fight for her husband, and to bring\r\narms for them. He was supported by most of the English nobility,\r\nwhile the principal commoners sided with the parliament.\r\n\r\n14. The first general for the parliament was the Earl of Essex, who\r\nresigned in favor of general Fairfax, but the greatest general of the\r\nparliamentary army was a country gentleman named Oliver Cromwell, who\r\nwas very clever, both as a military officer and a statesman; and,\r\nafter the death of Charles, he became the ruler of England.\r\n\r\n15. The war caused a great deal of unhappiness in private families;\r\nfor, although it was principally the soldiers who fought, everybody\r\nwas interested in the question whether there should be a king, or\r\nnot; and such violent quarrels arose, that the nearest relatives,\r\neven fathers and sons, and brothers often became enemies, and many\r\nyoung men went to join one army, or the other; so that sometimes two\r\nbrothers might be on different sides; and then think how dreadful it\r\nwas, when a battle took place, that they should be fighting against\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n16. The Royalists, who were called Cavaliers, were known from the\r\nRoundheads by their handsome style of dress, for they wore colored\r\ndoublets made of silk or satin, with lace collars falling over them,\r\nand a short cloak over one shoulder. Their hair was curled in long\r\nringlets, and their broad hats adorned with long feathers.\r\n\r\n17. There was as much difference in dress between the ladies as the\r\ngentlemen, for the female Roundheads were very plain and prim in\r\ntheir attire, while the Royalists were dressed in the gayest fashion.\r\n\r\n18. I shall not enter into the particulars of the war. It is enough\r\nto say that after it had gone on three years, the king was totally\r\ndefeated, at the battle of Naseby, in Northamptonshire, and soon\r\nafterwards was made prisoner.\r\n\r\n19. The Republicans then had it all their own way. The king was\r\nbrought to trial on a charge of having broken the laws of the\r\ncountry; was condemned to death, and beheaded at Whitehall, January\r\n30th, 1649.\r\n\r\n20. But the civil war did not end with the death of Charles the\r\nFirst, for his son, prince Charles, who was in Holland at the time,\r\nwent to Scotland, where the generality of the people were not\r\ndisposed to have a republican government, so they made the prince\r\npromise not to interfere with their religion, but to join the\r\nPresbyterians, and then they proclaimed him king, and soon raising an\r\narmy, he marched into England.\r\n\r\n21. A battle was fought at Worcester, where Cromwell gained a great\r\nvictory, and the young king had to make his escape, in disguise,\r\nwith a few friends, who were anxious to get him safely out of the\r\ncountry; and many curious adventures they met with, for parties of\r\nthe republican soldiers were sent off in all directions in pursuit of\r\nthe fugitive prince, who was several times very nearly caught.\r\n\r\n22. His escape was chiefly owing to the fidelity of five brothers,\r\nnamed Penderel, farmers and woodmen, who were tenants of a gentleman\r\nthat was warmly attached to the Royal family. They lent him a\r\nwoodman\xe2\x80\x99s dress, called him Will Jones; and rode about with him,\r\nto show him what houses he might safely go to for shelter and\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n23. On the third day after the battle, he was obliged to hide in a\r\nwood, in Boscobel, on the borders of Staffordshire, where he met with\r\na friend, Major Carlis, who was hiding himself.\r\n\r\n24. They heard soldiers about the wood, so they both got up into an\r\nold oak tree, with some bread and cheese and beer, that one of the\r\nPenderels had brought to Charles, and while they were there, they\r\nheard the soldiers talking close under the tree, and saying how glad\r\nthey should be to find the king, and that they were sure he must be\r\nsomewhere thereabouts.\r\n\r\n25. The tree was afterwards called the Royal Oak; and there is a tree\r\nnow on the same spot, raised from an acorn of the original one, which\r\nis still distinguished by that name.\r\n\r\n26. One time he travelled with a lady, as her groom, and when they\r\nstopped at an inn, he went into the kitchen, where the cook told him\r\nto wind up the jack, which he did so awkwardly, that she scolded him.\r\n\r\n27. He made an excuse, saying that where he came from, they did not\r\nhave roast meat very often, and never used a jack; but I dare say, he\r\nlaughed heartily afterwards, for he was always merry in the midst of\r\nhis troubles.\r\n\r\n28. At last, after being at hide and seek for nearly two months, he\r\nembarked at Shoreham, and reached the continent in safety.\r\n\r\n29. Great Britain was now not a kingdom, for there was no king, but\r\nit was a Republic, or Commonwealth, which is a government managed by\r\nthe people, or their representatives in parliament.\r\n\r\n30. But Oliver Cromwell was an ambitious man, and wanted to have all\r\nthe power in his own hands; so he got the soldiers on his side, and\r\nthen told the members of parliament that it was time for them to\r\ngo out of office, that there might be a new election; and on their\r\nrefusal, he went to the House of Commons with a regiment of soldiers,\r\nturned out the members, locked the doors, and took away the keys.\r\n\r\n31. He soon formed a new Parliament of men who were devoted to his\r\ninterest, and he was made chief ruler of the state, under the name of\r\nProtector of the Commonwealth; but he might as well have been called\r\nking, for he was almost as absolute a sovereign as any that had yet\r\nreigned.\r\n\r\n32. However, he made a good use of his power by promoting trade, and\r\nforeign commerce, besides which, he had an excellent army, and a good\r\nnavy, so that England was considered of more importance, by other\r\nnations, than it had ever been before.\r\n\r\n33. The English Admiral, Blake, gained some great victories over\r\nthe Dutch at sea; and some conquests were made both in the East and\r\nWest Indies, particularly that of Jamaica, which was taken from the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\n34. The English people obeyed Cromwell more from fear than love,\r\nyet he had so many great qualities that he was respected, as well\r\nas feared. Milton, the poet, was one of his secretaries, and was\r\nmuch attached to him, as I believe most people were, who belonged to\r\nhis domestic circle, for Cromwell was kind and mild in his family,\r\nalthough severe and determined in his public character.\r\n\r\n35. There was not much merriment in England, while he was its ruler,\r\nfor the Puritans thought it sinful to dance, or feast, or sing, or\r\nplay at any games; so all the theatres and other places of public\r\namusement were ordered to be shut up, even at Christmas, which had\r\npreviously been a very gay time, when everybody, rich or poor, used\r\nto make holiday for twelve days; and in every country mansion, there\r\nwas a good Christmas dinner, and plenty of fun afterwards, old and\r\nyoung playing at forfeits, blindman\xe2\x80\x99s buff, and other Christmas\r\ngambols, in the great hall.\r\n\r\n36. But these frolics were forbidden in Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s time, and if any\r\nmerry-hearted folks indulged in such doings, it was by stealth, and\r\nthey kept it secret.\r\n\r\n37. The prim dress, and hats with high crowns, were worn by both\r\nsexes; for if any persons had dressed in a gayer fashion, they would\r\nhave been taken for Royalists. Cromwell died six years after he was\r\nmade Protector, and ten from the death of Charles the First.\r\n\r\n38. A great many improvements were made during the Commonwealth; for\r\ninstance, coffee, sugar, and India muslins, were first brought to\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n39. When Oliver Cromwell was dead, his son Richard was made\r\nProtector; but he liked a quiet life, and soon gave up the\r\ntroublesome task of ruling the country; and as most people were now\r\nof opinion it was better to have a king than not, the parliament\r\nresolved to recall Charles, who was residing in Holland, and\r\nmessengers were sent to tell him that he would be restored to the\r\nthrone, on condition that all persons should have liberty to follow\r\ntheir religious belief, and that no one should be punished for\r\nhaving taken part against him, or his father, before.\r\n\r\n40. He returned to England, and entered London in great state, on the\r\n29th of May, 1660, on which day, every year, you may always hear the\r\nbells ringing, to commemorate the restoration of Charles the Second.\r\n\r\n41. But the rejoicing is because the old form of government was\r\nrestored; for Charles was not, by any means, a good sovereign, nor\r\nhad he one quality to be admired, except that he was good natured to\r\nthose about him, and liked to make fun of every thing. However, I\r\nmust not forget to say that he rewarded the Penderels, who had been\r\nso kind to him in his misfortunes.\r\n\r\n42. England was now quite a different place from what it had been.\r\nEvery body might be as merry as they chose; the theatres were\r\nre-opened; holidays kept; the villagers danced round their may-poles\r\nas they used to do, and were not afraid to laugh and sing; while\r\nthe towns-people had their pleasant social meetings, and the London\r\ncitizens their grand feasts, and fine shows, as in the days of\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n43. During the Commonwealth, there were no bishops, nor any music\r\nallowed in the churches; but now, the bishops were restored to their\r\nformer dignity, and beautiful church music was again heard.\r\n\r\n43. But, I am sorry to say, the king did not keep his promise to let\r\nall persons enjoy their own religion, which caused a great deal of\r\nunhappiness, for numbers of families, to escape being put in prison,\r\nor having their property taken from them, left their comfortable\r\nhomes, and went to settle in the new American colonies, where they\r\nhad to endure many hardships, for it is a long time before the people\r\nin new settlements can obtain the means of living in any degree of\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n44. About five years after the return of king Charles, the plague\r\nbroke out in London, and continued to rage for many months with\r\nfearful violence.\r\n\r\n45. The streets were, at that time, narrow and dirty; the houses\r\nmostly of wood, and not airy; nor was the city so well paved\r\nor cleansed, nor so well supplied with water, as at present,\r\nconsequently it was not so healthy; and then, the doctors were not\r\nso clever as they are now, so that many died, who perhaps might have\r\nbeen saved.\r\n\r\n46. It was a melancholy time. The houses were all shut up; no\r\nbusiness was transacted, and scarcely anybody was to be seen in the\r\nstreets, which were sad and silent, for death was in almost every\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n47. The king and queen, and most of the great people, went out of\r\ntown, but some of the clergymen and other benevolent persons, stayed\r\nto do what good they could, and some of them caught the infection,\r\nand died.\r\n\r\n48. At last, when the heat of the summer was over, the plague began\r\nto abate, and those who had survived it, returned to their usual\r\noccupations; but with sorrowful hearts, for most of them had to mourn\r\nthe loss of their dearest friends.\r\n\r\n49. The plague had often raged in London before, but had never been\r\nso bad; and perhaps the great fire that followed it, tended greatly\r\nto remove the cause of this dreadful distemper.\r\n\r\n50. The memorable fire of London happened September, 1666. It began\r\nat a baker\xe2\x80\x99s shop, near London-bridge, and spread rapidly from street\r\nto street, till almost all the town was in flames.\r\n\r\n51. It continued to burn for three days, and destroyed nearly the\r\nwhole city, with most of the churches and public buildings; but there\r\nwere very few lives lost, as the people fled from their houses when\r\nthey saw the fire approaching the street in which they lived.\r\n\r\n52. Many, however, were ruined by the loss of their property, and all\r\nwere left houseless, so that they had to set up tents in the fields,\r\nto shelter themselves till they could find some place to go to; and\r\nsubscriptions were made for the relief of those who were most in\r\nneed, for generally the respectable citizens had saved their plate,\r\njewels, and money.\r\n\r\n53. The fire put an end to the pestilence, and so far proved a\r\nbenefit, in the end; for the city was rebuilt with wider streets; the\r\nhouses were built of brick or stone, and altogether it was handsomer\r\nand more healthy; one proof of which is, that the plague has not been\r\nknown in London since.\r\n\r\n54. The visitation of the cholera, in 1829-30, although partaking\r\nsomewhat of the character of a plague, was a different disease, and\r\nyielded to cleanliness and medical treatment.\r\n\r\n55. It was about this time, that tea was first brought to England,\r\nfrom China, by the East India Company; but it was so very dear, that\r\na pound of tea was thought a handsome present, and it was a very long\r\nwhile before people drank it as they do now.\r\n\r\n56. Except in London, Liverpool, and some of the principal towns,\r\nnobody had ever heard of such a thing as tea; for there was but\r\nlittle intercourse between London and the country towns at that\r\ntime, as the roads were still bad, and there were no stage coaches\r\ntill a few years after the death of Charles the Second, and then only\r\non three or four of the principal roads.\r\n\r\n57. The rich country gentlefolks lived in a plain homely way, and\r\ntheir daughters were brought up to assist in domestic duties, such as\r\nwashing, ironing, cooking, knitting, and many other useful things;\r\nbut they seldom had any other accomplishments, and very few could\r\nread or write.\r\n\r\n58. Charles the Second died in 1685, twenty-five years after his\r\nrestoration, and was succeeded by his brother James, who was a\r\nCatholic, and tried to restore the Catholic religion, although he had\r\npromised not to do so.\r\n\r\n59. The people soon began to feel that he did not mind breaking the\r\nlaws to accomplish this object; so a great many Protestant noblemen\r\nand gentlemen agreed that it would be better to take the crown from\r\nhim, and to place on the throne a prince of another family, for\r\nthey said, the laws would never be rightly observed so long as the\r\nStuarts, or a Catholic king, reigned; so they sent to William, prince\r\nof Orange, who was married to the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Mary, and asked\r\nhim to become king of England, and he consented.\r\n\r\n60. He came, with a large army, to Torbay, in Devonshire; but there\r\nwas no fighting, for king James, with his wife and infant son, fled\r\nto France, where he was kindly received by the French king, Louis the\r\nFourteenth, who promised to try and replace him on the throne; but\r\nthe attempt was unsuccessful, as you will presently see.\r\n\r\n61. James the Second had only reigned in England three years, and\r\nduring that time the Protestants were so cruelly treated in France,\r\nthat thousands of industrious artisans came over here, chiefly silk\r\nweavers, but also watchmakers, cutlers, and manufacturers of glass,\r\nwriting paper and many other things; from whom the English learned to\r\nmake all these things as well as the French.\r\n\r\n62. The middle classes were much better off than at any former time,\r\non account of the increase of trade; but the lower orders were not so\r\nwell off, for wages were less, in proportion to the prices of bread\r\nand meat, than they were at earlier periods of our history.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  2.

The changes made in the government by taking the crown from James\r\nthe Second, and giving it to William the Third, was called the\r\nRevolution, and was a good thing for England, as it was then settled\r\nthat no sovereign, in the future, should follow his own will, or act\r\ncontrary to the laws of the country; that all new laws should be\r\nproposed by the parliament, and not by the king; who was only to\r\nhave the power of giving or refusing his consent to them; which is\r\nvery different from being able to make laws without asking any one,\r\nas the kings and queens of England had hitherto often done.\r\n\r\n2. The way, now, is this:--when a gentleman of the House of Commons,\r\nor a nobleman of the House of Lords, thinks of any thing that will be\r\ngood for the nation, he mentions it to the rest and they all consult\r\nabout it, every one giving his opinion whether he thinks it good or\r\nnot; and if the greater number think it will be good, it is settled\r\nthat it shall be done, if both Houses of Parliament and the sovereign\r\nagree to it; for whichever House of Parliament begins and agrees to a\r\nmeasure, it is sent to the other House for approval:--this is called\r\npassing the bill.\r\n\r\n3. When both Houses have done what they consider good and necessary,\r\nit is submitted to the queen or king, who generally approves of it\r\nalso; and then it becomes a law.\r\n\r\n4. Another rule made at the Revolution was, that the parliament\r\nshould meet every year, and that there should be a new election at\r\nleast once in three years, to give the people an opportunity of\r\nchoosing other members, if they had not approved the votes of the old\r\nones; but, in the reign of George the First, this arrangement was\r\naltered to seven years, and so it has continued ever since.\r\n\r\n5. It was also agreed that none but a Protestant should ever be king\r\nor queen of England; and all these, with many other regulations, were\r\nwritten down, and signed by king William, and this is called the Bill\r\nof Rights.\r\n\r\n6. No one was to be persecuted on account of his or her religion;\r\nbut the Catholics were not allowed to hold landed property, or to\r\nbe members of parliament; and it was not till the reign of George\r\nthe Fourth that people of the Catholic faith were restored to their\r\nancient rights and privileges.\r\n\r\n7. Soon after William was made king, he had to go to Ireland, to\r\nfight against James the Second, who had landed there with a French\r\narmy, thinking the Irish would assist him to recover the throne. But\r\nhe was defeated in a battle fought on the banks of the river Boyne,\r\nand obliged to go back to France, where he lived in retirement for\r\nthe rest of his life.\r\n\r\n8. His daughter, Mary, the wife of king William, was a very amiable\r\nwoman, and much beloved by the English. It was she who induced the\r\ngovernment to convert the palace at Greenwich into an asylum for\r\npoor old sailors; and the king gave money for the purpose.\r\n\r\n9. The East Indian trade was very much increased during this reign,\r\nso that all things that came from China and India, such as tea, silk,\r\ncotton, spices, porcelain or china ware, and many other beautiful and\r\nuseful things, became more easy to be procured in this country.\r\n\r\n10. I must also tell you that the Bank of England was now first\r\nestablished, for the purpose of raising money for the government to\r\ncarry on war against Louis the Fourteenth, of France; and this was\r\nthe beginning of what you will sometimes hear called the National\r\nDebt; for when people put money into the bank, it is the same as\r\nlending it to the king or the government; and as long as they choose\r\nto lend it, they are paid so much a year for doing so, and this is\r\ncalled their dividend, which they go to the Bank twice a year to\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n11. The war in which king William was engaged, had nothing whatever\r\nto do with the English, but was only for the sake of helping the\r\nArchduke of Austria, to fight out his quarrels with the king of\r\nFrance; yet, after William\xe2\x80\x99s death, these wars were carried on during\r\nthe whole reign of queen Anne, who succeeded William the Third, in\r\nthe year 1702, after he had reigned thirteen years.\r\n\r\n12. These wars caused great distress in England, where the taxes were\r\nincreased, to pay the expenses of the soldiers, and trade was much\r\ninjured, as we were at war with both France and Spain.\r\n\r\n13. There was a duty, for the first time, laid upon many things that\r\npeople have to use every day, such as soap, starch, and paper, so\r\nthat all these articles became much dearer.\r\n\r\n14. The meaning of a duty is this:--The parliament says, no person\r\nmay make any paper, unless he give to the government so much money\r\nfor every ream he makes; so the paper-makers pay the money, and\r\ncharge more for their paper to the shopkeepers, who buy it of them;\r\nthen you and I, and everybody who uses paper, must pay more for it\r\nthan if there was no duty; and the same with all things on which\r\nthere are duties. So you see the expenses of war fall upon every one,\r\nin some way or other.\r\n\r\n15. Queen Anne was a daughter of James the Second, but as she was\r\na Protestant, no objection was made to her accession, although her\r\nbrother was excluded from the throne, as being a Catholic.\r\n\r\n16. The most important event that took place in the reign of queen\r\nAnne, was the complete union of England and Scotland, for although\r\nthey had been governed by one king, since the time of James the\r\nFirst, they had separate parliaments, and different laws; but it was\r\nnow settled that a certain number of the Scottish lords and commons\r\nshould sit in the English houses of parliament, and that all the laws\r\nabout trade, and every thing that did not interfere with the habits\r\nor religion of Scotland, should be the same.\r\n\r\n17. This union of the parliaments took place in 1707, from which time\r\nEngland and Scotland have been one country, called Great Britain.\r\n\r\n18. There was a celebrated General, the Duke of Marlborough, who\r\nwon some famous battles in Germany in the reign of queen Anne; and\r\nthere was a brave Admiral, Sir George Rooke, who took the fortress\r\nof Gibraltar, which was a conquest of some importance to England,\r\nbecause it stands at the entrance of the Mediterranean sea, and may\r\nbe said to command the passage taken by ships trading to the Grecian\r\nislands, Egypt, Turkey, &c. Queen Anne died in the year 1714, having\r\nreigned twelve years.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1. What was meant by the Revolution?\r\n\r\n  2.

When queen Anne died, the crown of England went to a German\r\nprince, named George, the elector or sovereign of Hanover, whose\r\nmother was grand-daughter of James the First.\r\n\r\n2. He was rather advanced in age, and being a stranger to the manners\r\nof the people, and to the language and laws of the country, was not\r\nlikely to become a popular monarch; yet it was thought better that he\r\nshould succeed to the throne, than to let the son of James II., who\r\nwas now about six-and-twenty, be king of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n3. But there were a great many people in Scotland who wished to see\r\nthe family of their ancient kings restored, and some of the great\r\nmen, there, raised an army, and invited prince James Stuart, who is\r\nusually called the Pretender, to place himself at the head of it, and\r\ngo to war with George the First.\r\n\r\n4. The Pretender went to Scotland, and two battles were fought, one\r\nnear Dumblane, and the other near Preston, in Lancashire; but the\r\nEnglish troops gained the victory at both places, and the prince was\r\nglad to get back to France again.\r\n\r\n5. A great many English had joined in this rebellion, for, as I said\r\nbefore, the new king was not very generally liked; and it was mostly\r\nthe English party that fought for the Pretender at Preston, and, I am\r\nsorry to say, all who were made prisoners were very cruelly treated.\r\nThe leaders were put to death, and those who had fought under their\r\ncommand, were mostly sent to America, and sold for slaves.\r\n\r\n6. You remember how the American colonies were first settled. Well,\r\nthey had now become large populous places, and cities had been built\r\nthere; but the people were cultivators, and had no manufactures\r\nof any kind, for they were obliged to have all they wanted of\r\nmanufactured goods, either for clothing, or any other purpose, from\r\nEngland, which was a great advantage to this country, by furnishing\r\nemployment for English manufactures.\r\n\r\n7. Perhaps you will say, why could they not have things from other\r\ncountries, as well as from England?--but you must bear in mind that\r\nthe American states were then under British government, and remained\r\nso till the reign of George the Third, when the Americans established\r\na government of their own, and went to war with Great Britain, as\r\nyou will presently read, and with the assistance of France, made\r\nthemselves independent of this country.\r\n\r\n8. George the First died in 1727, having reigned nearly thirteen\r\nyears, and he was succeeded by his son, George the Second.\r\n\r\n9. There had been a great change in the mode of dress since the\r\ntime of the Stuarts, for queen Anne had introduced a fashion of\r\nsetting out the gowns with hoops; and gentlemen wore coats with broad\r\nsquare-cut tails, waistcoats with long flaps, colored stockings\r\ndrawn up over the knee, lace ruffles, large shoe buckles, wigs with\r\nrows of stiff curls, three-cornered hats bound with gold-lace, and\r\nswords.\r\n\r\n10. Towards the close of the eighteenth century this formal\r\ninconvenient style of dress was altered gradually; swords were left\r\noff; the hair which, in the early part of the reign of George the\r\nThird, was frizzed out, pomatumed and powdered, was dressed in a more\r\nnatural manner; round hats came into fashion, and people began to\r\nlook something like what they do now.\r\n\r\n11. The reign of George the Second, which lasted thirty-three years,\r\nwas on the whole rather a prosperous one, the greater part of it\r\nbeing spent in peace. There was no war for about twelve years, and\r\nduring that time improvements were going on all over the country.\r\n\r\n12. Most of the great towns were made larger, and new manufactories\r\nbuilt, for the trade of England was increasing every year, and great\r\nquantities of manufactured goods were sent out to foreign countries;\r\nbesides which, new roads were opened, waste lands cultivated, canals\r\nformed, and new harbors made for shipping, so that there was plenty\r\nof employment for the laboring people.\r\n\r\n13. We had a good navy at this time, and the first war that broke\r\nout was carried on entirely at sea. It was with the Spaniards, who\r\nhad taken possession of a great part of South America, and, as they\r\nchose to keep all the trade to themselves, they had ships constantly\r\nsailing about, to prevent the ships of other nations coming there,\r\nwhich was all very fair; but not content with guarding their own\r\npossessions, they interfered with British merchants, who were going\r\nto or from other places, plundered some of their vessels, and behaved\r\nso ill, that the British government was obliged to declare war, and\r\nsent out a great many ships to fight the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n14. I dare say you have heard stories about press-gangs taking away\r\npoor men against their will, to make sailors of them. This cruel\r\nexpedient for getting plenty of sailors, was resorted to in all the\r\nwars during the reigns of George the Second and George the Third,\r\nwhen many a poor fellow, in going to or returning from his daily\r\nlabor, was met by a party of armed men, called a press-gang, and\r\ncarried off, by force, to a ship, without being allowed to go home,\r\nor take leave of his family. Such things ought not to be done in a\r\nfree country, and I hope they never will be done again, even if we\r\nshould have the misfortune to be at war.\r\n\r\n15. At this time, the French had large possessions in India, as well\r\nas the English, and it seemed doubtful which of the two nations\r\nwould, in the end, be masters of the country; but this question was\r\ndecided in the reign of George the Second, for, while the war with\r\nSpain was going on, a war broke out between France and England, about\r\nthe affairs of Germany, where our king himself commanded the army,\r\nand fought at the battle of Dettingen; but the fighting between the\r\nFrench and English in India, was of more consequence, as several\r\ngreat victories were gained by a brave commander, named Clive, by\r\nwhich the superiority of the English in India was quite established,\r\nand ever since that time, we have gained one place after another, in\r\nthat extensive and rich country, until a large portion of India has\r\nbecome a province of the British empire.\r\n\r\n16. While these wars were going on abroad, there was another great\r\nrebellion in Scotland; for prince Charles Edward Stuart, the son of\r\nthe old Pretender, being now a man, had come there to make another\r\nattempt to recover the throne for his father; and being joined by\r\nsome of the Highland chiefs, and numbers of Scotch people, as well as\r\nby many English who were discontented with the government, he went\r\nto Holyrood house, the old palace of his ancestors, at Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he held a court, and behaved as if he had been sovereign of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n17. Of course, an army was sent from England, to put down this\r\nrebellion, which caused a great deal of misery; for, besides the\r\nnumbers of brave men that were killed in the several battles which\r\ntook place, many were afterwards executed as traitors, which must\r\nhave been more dreadful for their families than if they had fallen in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n18. If Charles Edward had any good feeling, I think he must have been\r\nvery sorry for the mischief he caused. He was finally defeated at the\r\nbattle of Culloden, and obliged to escape, like Charles the Second,\r\nafter the battle of Worcester, and his adventures are very similar,\r\nbut more full of suffering, than those of the merry monarch. This is\r\nusually called the Rebellion of \xe2\x80\x9945, because it was in the year 1745.\r\n\r\n19. There is only one thing more of importance to mention in the\r\nreign of George the Second, and that is the conquest of the large\r\ncountry of Canada, in North America, which had belonged to the\r\nFrench, who had settled there as the English had in the United\r\nStates, and built several good towns, one of which was Quebec.\r\n\r\n20. There had frequently been quarrels between the French and\r\nEnglish in America, respecting their possessions, which, at length,\r\noccasioned a war there, and soldiers were sent out both from France\r\nand England, the French wanting to conquer the British states, the\r\nEnglish to gain possession of Canada.\r\n\r\n21. This war had lasted about five years, when the renowned General\r\nWolfe gained a great victory at the battle of Quebec; after which,\r\nthe French gave up Canada, which has belonged to England ever since,\r\nand is a very useful possession, supplying abundance of fine corn,\r\nand timber for building.\r\n\r\n22. General Wolfe was killed on the field of battle, just as the\r\nvictory was won, and his death was much lamented in England, where\r\nthe news of the conquest arrived a few days before the death of\r\nthe king, which happened in October, 1760, after he had reigned\r\nthirty-three years.\r\n\r\n23. The eldest son of George the Second was dead, but he had\r\nleft a son, named George, who succeeded his grandfather, and was\r\nabout twenty-two years old. He was a very good man and was highly\r\nrespected, although many people say he was more fitted for a country\r\ngentleman than a king.\r\n\r\n24. He married a German princess, whose name was Charlotte, and they\r\nhad many children, some of whom are yet living. Our queen is the\r\ngrand-daughter of George the Third.\r\n\r\n25. About two years after the new king came to the throne, peace was\r\nmade with France and Spain, and there were no more wars for thirteen\r\nyears, when the Americans became dissatisfied with the English\r\ngovernment, and resolved to have a government of their own.\r\n\r\n26. But let us see what useful things were done in England during\r\nthat thirteen years of peace. First of all, the manufacture of China\r\nware was begun in Staffordshire, by a gentleman, named Wedgewood, who\r\nbuilt large factories and employed a great number of people in this\r\nnew branch of art. Then a machine was invented for spinning cotton,\r\nby which we were enabled to manufacture cotton goods in much larger\r\nquantities than before, and as they could be sold abroad, this was a\r\ngreat benefit.\r\n\r\n27. It was also discovered how very useful steam engines might be\r\nmade; but I fancy nobody then imagined that we should ever travel by\r\nsteam, or print by steam, or do many other wonderful things, that are\r\nnow done by that means.\r\n\r\n28. Turnpike roads were established all over the kingdom, and\r\ntravelling thus rendered safer and more expeditious. People were in\r\ngeneral much better educated than in the preceding century, and all\r\narts and sciences were greatly improved.\r\n\r\n29. And now I will tell you something about the American war. The\r\nquarrel began about some taxes which the British government imposed\r\non the Americans, to help to pay the expenses of the wars with France\r\nand Spain, which the Americans thought they had nothing to do with;\r\nand considered it unjust that they should have to find money towards\r\npaying for them.\r\n\r\n30. British troops were sent out, to force them to obey the orders of\r\nthe government; but instead of complying, all the colonies agreed to\r\njoin together and fight for their liberty; and a very brave and good\r\nman, named General Washington, took the command of the American army.\r\n\r\n31. This war lasted many years, and the French and Dutch assisted the\r\nAmericans with troops, ships, and money.\r\n\r\n32. There were many gentlemen in the English parliament who wanted to\r\nput an end to the war, by giving up all control over the Americans;\r\nbut others would not consent, the king was unwilling to do so, till,\r\nat last, finding there was little chance of success, the English\r\ngovernment gave up the contest, and the American colonies became\r\nindependent of England, and took the name of the United States.\r\n\r\n33. This event took place in 1783, after which, there were a few more\r\nyears of peace, and then the long wars with France were begun, which\r\nlasted above twenty years, and were ended by the famous battle of\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\n34. The cause of the war was this. There had been a great revolution\r\nin France. The people rose up against king Louis the Sixteenth,\r\nwho was made prisoner, and beheaded; just as Charles the First was\r\ntreated here, and for much the same cause. Then a number of persons\r\ntook the government into their own hands, and governed without a\r\nking, and declared war against the king of Great Britain, and also\r\nagainst the stadtholder of Holland, and the king of Spain, for\r\ndisapproving of what the French people had done.\r\n\r\n35. The Spaniards and Dutch were afterwards obliged to join the\r\nFrench, and many battles were fought both on land and at sea, and\r\nsome naval victories were gained by the British Admirals Duncan,\r\nHowe, and Nelson, and other officers.\r\n\r\n36. The greatest man in France at this time was Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nan artillery officer, who raised himself to the head of the state,\r\njust as Cromwell did here, by getting the soldiers to side with him.\r\nHe was called consul, at first, but afterwards he was made emperor,\r\nand he conquered a great part of Europe, and he made the governments\r\nof those countries which he did not conquer do just as he pleased,\r\nexcept England, for he had the largest armies of any sovereign in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n37. The most celebrated of our generals in the war against Bonaparte,\r\nwere Abercrombie, Sir John Moore, and the Duke of Wellington, the\r\nlast of whom won a great many battles in Spain, and at last, with the\r\nassistance of the Prussians, gained the great victory at Waterloo,\r\nnear Brussels, on the 18th of June, 1815, after which, Bonaparte\r\nsurrendered to the English, and was banished to a small island,\r\ncalled St. Helena, in the South Atlantic Ocean, where he died in a\r\nfew years. The fall of Bonaparte was followed by a general peace.\r\n\r\n38. George the Third was still living, but he had been out of his\r\nmind, and blind, for some time, so that his son George, prince of\r\nWales, had been made regent in the year 1810, and conducted the\r\ngovernment with that title, till his father\xe2\x80\x99s death, which happened\r\nin the year 1820, he having reigned above fifty-nine years, when\r\nGeorge the Fourth became king, instead of regent.\r\n\r\n39. But I must now go back some years to tell you of something that\r\nwas done at the beginning of this century. You have been told that\r\nIreland had been subject to England, ever since the time of Henry the\r\nSecond; but there had constantly been quarrels and warfare between\r\nthe native Irish, and the new Irish, who were the descendants of the\r\nEnglish, who had settled there, after the conquest.\r\n\r\n40. Then the new Irish were just as ready to quarrel with new English\r\nsettlers, as the old Irish were with them; and, till the last fifty\r\nyears, little had been done to make the people of Ireland a better or\r\na happier race. They had a parliament of their own, but it did not\r\nencourage the people to be industrious, so they were, of course, very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n41. A few years after the war with France began, there was a great\r\nrebellion in Ireland, and soldiers were sent from England, to put a\r\nstop to it, which I am afraid was not done without a great deal of\r\ncruelty; but it was in consequence of this rebellion that the English\r\ngovernment resolved that the parliament and country of Ireland should\r\nbe united to that of England; as the parliament and country of\r\nScotland had been, and this union took place on the first of January,\r\n1801, which you will easily remember, because it was the first day of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n42. Many good laws have been made since then, for the benefit of\r\nIreland, and much been done to improve the country; but numbers of\r\nthe Irish people still remain in a very distressed condition, and\r\nsome of them wanted to have a separate Parliament again; and this is\r\nwhat is meant by Repeal of the Union; but this feeling is now fast\r\ndying away.\r\n\r\n43. In the reign of George the Third, there were National and Sunday\r\nschools established in almost every part of England, so that the poor\r\npeople might be able to have their children taught to read and write,\r\nwhich was a great blessing to them; for although there had long been\r\ncharity schools in London, there were few in the country, and many of\r\nthe shopkeepers in country towns, who had become quite respectable\r\npeople by their industry, were so ignorant that they could not even\r\nmake out their own bills, or keep their own accounts.\r\n\r\n44. There were two more great improvements before the death of George\r\nthe Third; the one was the invention of gas lights, which make the\r\nstreets much lighter at night than the dim oil lamps that were\r\nformerly used; and the other was the introduction of steam boats,\r\nwhich had lately been invented in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

George the Fourth, who had been regent ten years, reigned as a\r\nking from 1820, to 1830. During that time, every improvement that\r\nhad been begun was carried to a greater extent. The education of\r\nall classes of people was conducted on a better system, and greater\r\nnumbers of cheap books were published for the instruction of the\r\nworking classes.\r\n\r\n2. London was greatly improved by the building, in some parts,\r\nof wide handsome streets, in the place of narrow, dirty, crowded\r\nones, and the manners of the English were improved also, by their\r\nintercourse with foreign nations; for after the peace, people began\r\nto visit France, Italy, and other parts of Europe, while a great\r\nnumber of foreigners came here, and we adopted such of their customs\r\nas were superior to our own; for people may always improve from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n3. The French, German, and Italian languages began to be more\r\ngenerally studied in England: and the arts and sciences, especially\r\npainting and music, were more highly cultivated.\r\n\r\n4. But I am sorry to say that, amid all these benefits, there was a\r\ngreat deal of distress among the laboring people, for the expenses\r\nof the war had been so heavy that it was some years before the\r\nblessings of peace could be felt; and thus all the necessaries of\r\nlife continued to be very dear, and wages, in proportion, very low,\r\nwhich occasioned riots in many parts of the kingdom; for the poor\r\npeople had expected that, as soon as there was peace, most of the\r\ntaxes pressing on them would be taken off.\r\n\r\n5. But the government thought it right first to take off the\r\nproperty tax, and then found they could not do without the money\r\nthe other taxes produced. Then the people, not getting relief from\r\nthe taxation, thought some alterations in the laws might remedy\r\ntheir distress, and sent petitions to parliament praying that these\r\nalterations might be made. The principal thing they wanted was, what\r\nyou have perhaps heard called the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n6. This was a law to give the right of voting for members of\r\nparliament to a greater number of people, and also to make\r\nalterations with regard to the places that were allowed to send\r\nmembers to parliament; for there were many old boroughs that were\r\nformerly important places, but now had scarcely a house left\r\nstanding, yet still were represented by two members in parliament;\r\nwhich was ridiculous, because the object of sending a member to\r\nparliament is, that he may do all the good he can for the people of\r\nthe place he represents, as well as for the nation; then there were\r\nmany large towns, such as Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, &c., that\r\nhad grown into importance since the time when it was settled what\r\nplaces should have representatives, and these had none at all.\r\n\r\n7. Another thing desired by the people, was an alteration in the\r\nCorn Laws, so that bread might be cheaper; and this alteration was to\r\nbe made by letting corn be brought from abroad without paying duty.\r\nNeither of these points were gained while George the Fourth was king;\r\nbut the Reform Bill was passed during the reign of his successor,\r\nWilliam the Fourth; and, in the year 1846, some important alterations\r\nwere made in the corn and provision laws.\r\n\r\n8. William the Fourth was the brother of George the Fourth, and on\r\nthe death of that monarch, in 1830, succeeded to the throne.\r\n\r\n9. That same year is memorable for the opening of the first Railway\r\nfor travelling, which was that between Manchester and Liverpool; a\r\ncircumstance that may be mentioned as the commencement of one of the\r\ngreatest changes of modern times, and when we consider the number and\r\nextent of the railways now in use, we cannot but admire the immense\r\nworks of the kind that have been performed in so short a space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n10. The speed with which we can now travel, both by sea and land,\r\nwould astonish our good old ancestors, who used to think it a great\r\nand dangerous undertaking to set out on a journey of twenty or thirty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n11. In the time of Charles the Second, the poet Cowley, who had\r\na country house at Chertsey, which is only twenty-two miles from\r\nLondon, invited a friend in town to pay him a visit, saying in his\r\nletter, that as he could not perform the whole journey in one day, he\r\nmight sleep at Hampton.\r\n\r\n12. I think he would have been glad of a railway, which would have\r\ntaken him all the way before breakfast. In 1706, the stage coach\r\nfrom York was four days coming to London; and so late as 1763, there\r\nwas only a coach once a month from Edinburgh to London; and it was a\r\nwhole fortnight on the road; so I think you will see the advantages\r\nof our present mode of travelling.\r\n\r\n13. The custom of buying and selling negroes had been abolished by\r\nparliament during the reign of George the Third, but there were many\r\nthousands of slaves in the West India islands, belonging to the\r\nBritish planters there.\r\n\r\n14. During the reign of William the Fourth, the British government\r\ngave twenty millions of money to buy all the slaves of their masters\r\nand then set them free. The day when the negroes became free people\r\nwas the first of August, 1838.\r\n\r\n15. I told you that the Reform Bill was passed in this reign. One\r\nconsequence of this measure was, the lessening of the duties, or\r\ntaxes, on many articles of necessity, thereby reducing their prices,\r\nso that the poor people could live much better than they had formerly.\r\n\r\n16. The harvests were also plentiful for several years, so that bread\r\nwas very cheap, and the prices of all kinds of clothing were less\r\nthan in previous years.\r\n\r\n17. Upon the whole, there had never been a better time in England\r\nthan the seven years that William the Fourth occupied the throne.\r\nHe died in 1837, and was succeeded by her present Majesty, queen\r\nVictoria, who was the daughter of his deceased brother, the Duke of\r\nKent.\r\n\r\n18. In 1840, she married her cousin, Prince Albert, of Saxe Coburg\r\nand Gotha. Their family now consists of eight children, four princes,\r\nand four princesses.\r\n\r\n19. The most remarkable events that have yet happened in the reign of\r\nqueen Victoria, are the wars in China and India: but I ought to have\r\nmentioned an alteration made in the last reign, with regard to the\r\nEast India trade, which you, perhaps, remember was carried on solely\r\nby the East India Company, according to a charter granted by queen\r\nElizabeth, and renewed, from time to time, by other sovereigns.\r\n\r\n20. In 1813, however, it was made lawful for private merchants to\r\ntrade to India; but this right was not extended to the trade with\r\nChina, which was still confined to the Company till 1833, when a new\r\nlaw was made with regard to that also, and any person then was at\r\nliberty to go to China for tea, silk, and other commodities, which\r\nhave since been much cheaper in consequence. Tea is little more than\r\nhalf the price it used to be, which is a great benefit and comfort to\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\n21. But this had nothing to do with the war in China, which arose\r\nfrom a dispute about the British merchants selling opium to the\r\nChinese, who were forbidden by their emperor to buy it, because it\r\ninjures the health of those who take it, like drinking spirits.\r\n\r\n22. Still the merchants continued to carry opium to China, and the\r\npeople to buy it; so the governor at Canton, the only Chinese town\r\nin which foreigners were allowed to trade, seized and burnt some\r\nship-loads of opium, for which he would not pay the owners; and this\r\nwas the cause of the war.\r\n\r\n23. There were several battles fought, in which the Chinese were\r\nalways defeated, for they were not much acquainted with the present\r\nart of war; but, at last, after three years of warfare, peace was\r\nmade with the British; and the Chinese emperor agreed to pay a sum\r\nof money, and to cede, or give up, to the British government, the\r\nIsland of Hong Kong; besides agreeing that English ships might land\r\ngoods for sale, at five ports, instead of one only, and that British\r\nmerchants might have warehouses, and reside at those places. A treaty\r\nto this effect was signed in August, 1842.\r\n\r\n24. The war in India, was much more serious, and lasted a great deal\r\nlonger. It was begun for the purpose of restoring to his throne an\r\nIndian prince, the king of Caboul, who had been deprived of his\r\nkingdom by another prince.\r\n\r\n25. The wars occasioned by this usurpation being likely to endanger\r\nthe safety of the British possessions, the Governor General thought\r\nit necessary to interfere; and from the year 1839 to that of 1846,\r\nthe British armies in India were engaged in terrible and destructive\r\nwars with the Affghans, and other nations in the north and west of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n26. These calamitous strifes were happily ended by two great\r\nvictories gained on the banks of the Sutlej, at the beginning of\r\n1846, the one by General Sir Harry Smith, the other, by General Sir\r\nHugh Gough. By the conquests made during these wars, the British\r\nempire is extended over the greater part of India.\r\n\r\n27. Among the important inventions of this reign, may be mentioned\r\nthat of the Electric Telegraph, by means of which communications can\r\nbe made between places a hundred miles apart in one moment, or indeed\r\nto any imaginable distances.\r\n\r\n28. I have already mentioned the distressed condition of great\r\nnumbers of the Irish people; and am sorry to have now to say that\r\ntheir misery has been greatly increased in the last three years, by\r\nthe failure of the potato crops, on which the lower orders in Ireland\r\ndepend for their subsistence.\r\n\r\n29. This food they can, with two or three months labor in the year,\r\ngrow for themselves; and as they are, unfortunately, contented with\r\nsuch poor living, it is a very sad thing for them when a bad season\r\noccurs, and the potatoes are spoiled; which happens generally once in\r\nsix or seven years.\r\n\r\n30. But there have now been three bad seasons following each other;\r\nand this calamity has caused so much distress, that thousands have\r\ndied of fevers and other diseases, occasioned by want of wholesome\r\nand sufficient food.\r\n\r\n31. The Parliament expended several millions of money in relieving\r\ntheir distresses, and providing them employment. Large sums of\r\nmoney were also subscribed by individuals in England, Scotland, and\r\nAmerica, for the relief of the people in Ireland; and charitable\r\ncommittees were formed in many parts of that country to receive the\r\nmoney, and distribute the food and clothing purchased with it.\r\n\r\n32. New poor laws have also been made by the government, to afford\r\ngreater relief to the destitute; and every thing has been done, that\r\nhumanity could suggest, to better their condition and relieve their\r\nwants.\r\n\r\n33. The year 1848 will ever be memorable for the revolutions that\r\nhave taken place in France and other parts of the continent. Louis\r\nPhilippe, the French king, was dethroned on the 24th of February,\r\n1848, and fled with his family, to England.\r\n\r\n34. At Berlin, the capital of Prussia, there was also an insurrection\r\nin March, 1848, when a frightful battle was fought in the streets,\r\nbetween the soldiers and the people.\r\n\r\n35. Great numbers of persons were killed on both sides, and many\r\nhouses were destroyed; and although peace was restored by the king\r\ngranting the demands of his subjects, yet that could not bring back\r\nhappiness to those who had lost their fathers, husbands, or brothers,\r\nin the fatal conflict.\r\n\r\n36. Besides those already named, revolutions, attended with great\r\nloss of life and destruction of property, have taken place at Vienna,\r\nthe capital of Austria, and other parts of Germany. Italy, too, has\r\nshared in the spread of revolution; Naples, Milan, and Venice, having\r\nbeen scenes of fearful tumult and destruction of life.\r\n\r\n37. In most of the places I have mentioned, the people having been\r\nfighting for a constitutional form of government, similar to that of\r\nour own happy united kingdom; conveying the strongest proof that we\r\nought not to wish for a change. Yet there have been some attempts\r\nmade to disturb the peace of this country, by ill-informed or\r\nworthless persons.\r\n\r\n38. Perhaps the desire for some increase in the number of the\r\nelectors, and in the places represented in parliament, by uniting the\r\nadjacent towns to the small boroughs, is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\n39. But when we think of the dreadful state of things in France,\r\nItaly and Germany, where so many thousands of people have lost their\r\nlives, where trade is ruined, where the middle classes are reduced to\r\npoverty, and the working people, in consequence, starving, for want\r\nof employment, we cannot be too thankful for the peace, the liberty,\r\nand prosperity, we enjoy in this more favored and happier country.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
