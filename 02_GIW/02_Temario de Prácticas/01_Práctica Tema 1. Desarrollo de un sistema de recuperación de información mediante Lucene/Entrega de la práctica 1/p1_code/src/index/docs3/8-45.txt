Mrs. Rachel Lynde is Surprised\r\n\r\n\r\n|MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down\r\ninto a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies\xe2\x80\x99 eardrops and\r\ntraversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the\r\nold Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook\r\nin its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool\r\nand cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s Hollow it was a quiet,\r\nwell-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.\r\nRachel Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s door without due regard for decency and decorum; it\r\nprobably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,\r\nkeeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children\r\nup, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never\r\nrest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend\r\nclosely to their neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s business by dint of neglecting their own;\r\nbut Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage\r\ntheir own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a\r\nnotable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she \xe2\x80\x9cran\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nSewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop\r\nof the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all\r\nthis Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen\r\nwindow, knitting \xe2\x80\x9ccotton warp\xe2\x80\x9d quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,\r\nas Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping\r\na sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up\r\nthe steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular\r\npeninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two\r\nsides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that\r\nhill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s all-seeing\r\neye.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in\r\nat the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house\r\nwas in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of\r\nbees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called \xe2\x80\x9cRachel\r\nLynde\xe2\x80\x99s husband\xe2\x80\x9d--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field\r\nbeyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on\r\nthe big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew\r\nthat he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening\r\nbefore in William J. Blair\xe2\x80\x99s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow\r\nhis turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for\r\nMatthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about\r\nanything in his whole life.\r\n\r\nAnd yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon\r\nof a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;\r\nmoreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was\r\nplain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy\r\nand the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable\r\ndistance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nHad it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this\r\nand that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both\r\nquestions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be\r\nsomething pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest\r\nman alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where\r\nhe might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and\r\ndriving in a buggy, was something that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen often. Mrs. Rachel,\r\nponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenjoyment was spoiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla\r\nwhere he\xe2\x80\x99s gone and why,\xe2\x80\x9d the worthy woman finally concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d run out of turnip seed he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dress up and take the buggy to\r\ngo for more; he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.\r\nYet something must have happened since last night to start him off. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nclean puzzled, that\xe2\x80\x99s what, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t know a minute\xe2\x80\x99s peace of mind or\r\nconscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea\r\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the\r\nbig, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a\r\nscant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s Hollow. To be sure, the\r\nlong lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert\xe2\x80\x99s father, as\r\nshy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly\r\ncould from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods\r\nwhen he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest\r\nedge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible\r\nfrom the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so\r\nsociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place\r\n_living_ at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just _staying_, that\xe2\x80\x99s what,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she stepped along the\r\ndeep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder\r\nMatthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by\r\nthemselves. Trees aren\xe2\x80\x99t much company, though dear knows if they were\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d be enough of them. I\xe2\x80\x99d ruther look at people. To be sure, they\r\nseem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they\xe2\x80\x99re used to it. A body\r\ncan get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green\r\nGables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one\r\nside with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.\r\nNot a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have\r\nseen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla\r\nCuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could\r\nhave eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial\r\npeck of dirt.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in\r\nwhen bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful\r\napartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully\r\nclean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its\r\nwindows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on\r\nthe back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,\r\nwhence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left\r\norchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,\r\nwas greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when\r\nshe sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to\r\nher too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to\r\nbe taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind\r\nher was laid for supper.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental\r\nnote of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,\r\nso that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but\r\nthe dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves\r\nand one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any\r\nparticular company. Yet what of Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s white collar and the sorrel\r\nmare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery\r\nabout quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla said briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a real fine\r\nevening, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Won\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down? How are all your folks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething that for lack of any other name might be called friendship\r\nexisted and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,\r\nin spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.\r\n\r\nMarilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark\r\nhair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little\r\nknot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She\r\nlooked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she\r\nwas; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had\r\nbeen ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative\r\nof a sense of humor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cI was kind of afraid _you_\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe\r\nhe was going to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla\xe2\x80\x99s lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs.\r\nRachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so\r\nunaccountably would be too much for her neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cMatthew went to Bright River. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting a little boy from an\r\norphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he\xe2\x80\x99s coming on the train tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a\r\nkangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.\r\nShe was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable\r\nthat Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to\r\nsuppose it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in earnest, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded when voice returned to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums\r\nin Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated\r\nAvonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought\r\nin exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people\r\nadopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly\r\nturning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!\r\nNothing!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth put such a notion into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded\r\ndisapprovingly.\r\n\r\nThis had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be\r\ndisapproved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n returned Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before\r\nChristmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the\r\nasylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.\r\nSpencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have\r\ntalked it over off and on ever since. We thought we\xe2\x80\x99d get a boy. Matthew\r\nis getting up in years, you know--he\xe2\x80\x99s sixty--and he isn\xe2\x80\x99t so spry as he\r\nonce was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate\r\nhard it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be to get hired help. There\xe2\x80\x99s never anybody to be had\r\nbut those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do\r\nget one broke into your ways and taught something he\xe2\x80\x99s up and off to the\r\nlobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a\r\nHome boy. But I said \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 flat to that. \xe2\x80\x98They may be all right--I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nsaying they\xe2\x80\x99re not--but no London street Arabs for me,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98Give\r\nme a native born at least. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be a risk, no matter who we get. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born\r\nCanadian.\xe2\x80\x99 So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out\r\none when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she\r\nwas going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s folks at Carmody\r\nto bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that\r\nwould be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores\r\nright off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him\r\na good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer\r\ntoday--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming\r\non the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to\r\nmeet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to\r\nWhite Sands station herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to\r\nspeak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece\r\nof news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell you plain that I think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a\r\nmighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re getting. You\xe2\x80\x99re bringing a strange child into your house and home\r\nand you don\xe2\x80\x99t know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is\r\nlike nor what sort of parents he had nor how he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to turn out.\r\nWhy, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up\r\nwest of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to\r\nthe house at night--set it _on purpose_, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to\r\na crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used\r\nto suck the eggs--they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t break him of it. If you had asked my\r\nadvice in the matter--which you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do, Marilla--I\xe2\x80\x99d have said for\r\nmercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake not to think of such a thing, that\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Job\xe2\x80\x99s comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She\r\nknitted steadily on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny there\xe2\x80\x99s something in what you say, Rachel. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some\r\nqualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could see that, so\r\nI gave in. It\xe2\x80\x99s so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he\r\ndoes I always feel it\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrisks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There\xe2\x80\x99s risks\r\nin people\xe2\x80\x99s having children of their own if it comes to that--they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalways turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island.\r\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if we were getting him from England or the States. He can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe much different from ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope it will turn out all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Rachel in a tone\r\nthat plainly indicated her painful doubts. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly don\xe2\x80\x99t say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwarn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well--I\r\nheard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did\r\nthat and the whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl\r\nin that instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re not getting a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, as if poisoning wells\r\nwere a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case\r\nof a boy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I wonder at\r\nMrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, _she_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shrink\r\nfrom adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his\r\nimported orphan. But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at\r\nleast before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert\r\nBell\xe2\x80\x99s and tell the news. It would certainly make a sensation second\r\nto none, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. So she took\r\nherself away, somewhat to Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s relief, for the latter felt\r\nher doubts and fears reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npessimism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of all things that ever were or will be!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Mrs. Rachel\r\nwhen she was safely out in the lane. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does really seem as if I must\r\nbe dreaming. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for that poor young one and no mistake.\r\nMatthew and Marilla don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about children and they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nexpect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather, if so be\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhe ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think\r\nof a child at Green Gables somehow; there\xe2\x80\x99s never been one there, for\r\nMatthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built--if they\r\never _were_ children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them.\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in that orphan\xe2\x80\x99s shoes for anything. My, but I pity him,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her\r\nheart; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently\r\nat the Bright River station at that very moment her pity would have been\r\nstill deeper and more profound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. Matthew Cuthbert is surprised\r\n\r\n\r\n|MATTHEW Cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight\r\nmiles to Bright River. It was a pretty road, running along between\r\nsnug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive\r\nthrough or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. The air\r\nwas sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped\r\naway in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple; while\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe little birds sang as if it were\r\n     The one day of summer in all the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion, except during the\r\nmoments when he met women and had to nod to them--for in Prince Edward\r\nisland you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road\r\nwhether you know them or not.\r\n\r\nMatthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he had an\r\nuncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly\r\nlaughing at him. He may have been quite right in thinking so, for he\r\nwas an odd-looking personage, with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray\r\nhair that touched his stooping shoulders, and a full, soft brown beard\r\nwhich he had worn ever since he was twenty. In fact, he had looked\r\nat twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the\r\ngrayness.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached Bright River there was no sign of any train; he thought\r\nhe was too early, so he tied his horse in the yard of the small Bright\r\nRiver hotel and went over to the station house. The long platform was\r\nalmost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was\r\nsitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end. Matthew, barely noting\r\nthat it _was_ a girl, sidled past her as quickly as possible without\r\nlooking at her. Had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the\r\ntense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression. She was\r\nsitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and\r\nwaiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all\r\nher might and main.\r\n\r\nMatthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office\r\npreparatory to going home for supper, and asked him if the five-thirty\r\ntrain would soon be along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthat brisk official. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there was a passenger dropped off for you--a\r\nlittle girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s sitting out there on the shingles. I asked her to\r\ngo into the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she\r\npreferred to stay outside. \xe2\x80\x98There was more scope for imagination,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid. She\xe2\x80\x99s a case, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not expecting a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew blankly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a boy I\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nfor. He should be here. Mrs. Alexander Spencer was to bring him over\r\nfrom Nova Scotia for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stationmaster whistled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess there\xe2\x80\x99s some mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Spencer came off the train\r\nwith that girl and gave her into my charge. Said you and your sister\r\nwere adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for\r\nher presently. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I know about it--and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any more\r\norphans concealed hereabouts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew helplessly, wishing that Marilla was\r\nat hand to cope with the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99d better question the girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the station-master\r\ncarelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say she\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to explain--she\xe2\x80\x99s got a tongue\r\nof her own, that\xe2\x80\x99s certain. Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you\r\nwanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate Matthew was\r\nleft to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its\r\nden--walk up to a girl--a strange girl--an orphan girl--and demand of\r\nher why she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a boy. Matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about\r\nand shuffled gently down the platform towards her.\r\n\r\nShe had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her\r\neyes on him now. Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen\r\nwhat she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would\r\nhave seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very\r\ntight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown\r\nsailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids\r\nof very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin,\r\nalso much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which\r\nlooked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.\r\n\r\nSo far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen\r\nthat the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes\r\nwere full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped\r\nand expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short,\r\nour discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no\r\ncommonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom\r\nshy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.\r\n\r\nMatthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon\r\nas she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with\r\none thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;\r\nthe other she held out to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in\r\na peculiarly clear, sweet voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to see you. I was\r\nbeginning to be afraid you weren\xe2\x80\x99t coming for me and I was imagining\r\nall the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up\r\nmy mind that if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come for me to-night I\xe2\x80\x99d go down the track to\r\nthat big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all\r\nnight. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a\r\nwild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\r\nYou could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? And\r\nI was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and\r\nthere he decided what to do. He could not tell this child with the\r\nglowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and\r\nlet Marilla do that. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be left at Bright River anyhow, no\r\nmatter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations\r\nmight as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I was late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said shyly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along. The horse is over in\r\nthe yard. Give me your bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can carry it,\xe2\x80\x9d the child responded cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t heavy.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t heavy. And if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncarried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nkeep it because I know the exact knack of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s an extremely old\r\ncarpet-bag. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come, even if it would have been\r\nnice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to drive a long piece,\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad because I\r\nlove driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to live with you\r\nand belong to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never belonged to anybody--not really. But the\r\nasylum was the worst. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only been in it four months, but that was\r\nenough. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t possibly understand what it is like. It\xe2\x80\x99s worse than anything you\r\ncould imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like\r\nthat, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be wicked. It\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to be wicked without\r\nknowing it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But\r\nthere is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just\r\nin the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about\r\nthem--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really\r\nthe daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents\r\nin her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I\r\nused to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time in the day. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m so thin--I _am_\r\ndreadful thin, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I? There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a pick on my bones. I do love to\r\nimagine I\xe2\x80\x99m nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s companion stopped talking, partly because she was\r\nout of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another\r\nword did she say until they had left the village and were driving down\r\na steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into\r\nthe soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees\r\nand slim white birches, were several feet above their heads.\r\n\r\nThe child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that\r\nbrushed against the side of the buggy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank,\r\nall white and lacy, make you think of?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\never expect to be a bride myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m so homely nobody will ever want to\r\nmarry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign\r\nmissionary mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be very particular. But I do hope that some day I\r\nshall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I\r\njust love pretty clothes. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a pretty dress in my life\r\nthat I can remember--but of course it\xe2\x80\x99s all the more to look forward\r\nto, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And then I can imagine that I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed gorgeously. This\r\nmorning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear\r\nthis horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you\r\nknow. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of\r\nwincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell\r\nit, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be\r\nlooking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that\r\nI had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_\r\nimagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big\r\nhat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and\r\nboots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island\r\nwith all my might. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither\r\nwas Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time\r\nto get sick, watching to see that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall overboard. She said she\r\nnever saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from\r\nbeing seasick it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy I did prowl, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And I wanted to see\r\neverything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether I\xe2\x80\x99d ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more\r\ncherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just\r\nlove it already, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I\xe2\x80\x99m going to live here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always\r\nheard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world,\r\nand I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I\r\nwould. It\xe2\x80\x99s delightful when your imaginations come true, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nBut those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at\r\nCharlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer\r\nwhat made them red and she said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know and for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake not\r\nto ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand\r\nalready. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about\r\nthings if you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions? And what _does_ make the roads red?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid\r\nto think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes\r\nme feel glad to be alive--it\xe2\x80\x99s such an interesting world. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nhalf so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too\r\nmuch? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk? If you say so I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop. I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it,\r\nalthough it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet\r\nfolks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking\r\nthemselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had\r\nnever expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad\r\nenough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the\r\nway they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if\r\nthey expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to\r\nsay a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But\r\nthis freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather\r\ndifficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental\r\nprocesses he thought that he \xe2\x80\x9ckind of liked her chatter.\xe2\x80\x9d So he said as\r\nshyly as usual:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you can talk as much as you like. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together\r\nfine. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told\r\nthat children should be seen and not heard. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had that said to me a\r\nmillion times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big\r\nwords. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express\r\nthem, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, that seems reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t--it\xe2\x80\x99s firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was\r\nnamed Green Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were\r\ntrees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And\r\nthere weren\xe2\x80\x99t any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny\r\nthings out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.\r\nThey just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to\r\nmake me want to cry to look at them. I used to say to them, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you\r\n_poor_ little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other\r\ntrees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your\r\nroots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you\r\ncould grow, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? But you can\xe2\x80\x99t where you are. I know just\r\nexactly how you feel, little trees.\xe2\x80\x99 I felt sorry to leave them behind\r\nthis morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Is\r\nthere a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s one right below the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy. It\xe2\x80\x99s always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I\r\nnever expected I would, though. Dreams don\xe2\x80\x99t often come true, do they?\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly\r\nperfectly happy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel exactly perfectly happy because--well,\r\nwhat color would you call this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and\r\nheld it up before Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on\r\nthe tints of ladies\xe2\x80\x99 tresses, but in this case there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s red, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from\r\nher very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s red,\xe2\x80\x9d she said resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you see why I can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nperfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the other\r\nthings so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I\r\ncan imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf\r\ncomplexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I _cannot_ imagine that\r\nred hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Now my hair is a\r\nglorious black, black as the raven\xe2\x80\x99s wing.\xe2\x80\x99 But all the time I _know_ it\r\nis just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow.\r\nI read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nred hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow.\r\nWhat is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, who was getting a little\r\ndizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy\r\nhad enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was\r\ndivinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be\r\ndivinely beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, no, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed Matthew ingenuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the\r\nchoice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make much real\r\ndifference for it isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be either. It\xe2\x80\x99s certain I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says--oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, Mr.\r\nCuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled\r\nout of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had\r\nsimply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the \xe2\x80\x9cAvenue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cAvenue,\xe2\x80\x9d so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road\r\nfour or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,\r\nwide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old\r\nfarmer. Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the\r\nboughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse\r\nof painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a\r\ncathedral aisle.\r\n\r\nIts beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the\r\nbuggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to\r\nthe white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving\r\ndown the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with\r\nrapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw\r\nvisions trooping splendidly across that glowing background. Through\r\nNewbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small\r\nboys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still\r\nin silence. When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child\r\nhad not spoken. She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically\r\nas she could talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling pretty tired and hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d Matthew ventured to\r\nsay at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the\r\nonly reason he could think of. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we haven\xe2\x80\x99t very far to go now--only\r\nanother mile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the\r\ndreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Cuthbert,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat place we came through--that\r\nwhite place--what was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, you must mean the Avenue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99\r\nprofound reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a kind of pretty place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty? Oh, _pretty_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful,\r\neither. They don\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing I ever saw that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be improved upon by\r\nimagination. It just satisfies me here\xe2\x80\x9d--she put one hand on her\r\nbreast--\xe2\x80\x9cit made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did\r\nyou ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t recollect that I ever had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have it lots of time--whenever I see anything royally beautiful. But\r\nthey shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning\r\nin a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of\r\nDelight. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a nice imaginative name? When I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the name\r\nof a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of\r\nthem so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins,\r\nbut I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that\r\nplace the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.\r\nHave we really only another mile to go before we get home? I\xe2\x80\x99m glad and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nalways sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may\r\ncome after, but you can never be sure. And it\xe2\x80\x99s so often the case that\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to\r\nthink of getting home. You see, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a real home since I can\r\nremember. It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming\r\nto a really truly home. Oh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking\r\nalmost like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it\r\nmidway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of\r\nsand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a\r\nglory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and\r\nrose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name\r\nhas ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing\r\ngroves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering\r\nshadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a\r\nwhite-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the\r\nhead of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.\r\nThere was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on\r\na slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was\r\nshining from one of its windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Barry\xe2\x80\x99s pond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that name, either. I shall call it--let me see--the\r\nLake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I know\r\nbecause of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives\r\nme a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew ruminated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly\r\nwhite grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you\r\nthink it can? There doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be much connection between grubs\r\nand lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it\r\nBarry\xe2\x80\x99s pond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard\r\nSlope\xe2\x80\x99s the name of his place. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for that big bush behind it\r\nyou could see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the bridge\r\nand round by the road, so it\xe2\x80\x99s near half a mile further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mr. Barry any little girls? Well, not so very little either--about\r\nmy size.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got one about eleven. Her name is Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d with a long indrawing of breath. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a perfectly lovely name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno. There\xe2\x80\x99s something dreadful heathenish about it,\r\nseems to me. I\xe2\x80\x99d ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that.\r\nBut when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they\r\ngave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,\r\nthen. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to shut my eyes tight.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m always afraid going over bridges. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help imagining that\r\nperhaps just as we get to the middle, they\xe2\x80\x99ll crumple up like a\r\njack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them\r\nfor all when I think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting near the middle. Because, you see, if\r\nthe bridge _did_ crumple up I\xe2\x80\x99d want to _see_ it crumple. What a jolly\r\nrumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid\r\nthere are so many things to like in this world? There we\xe2\x80\x99re over. Now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say\r\ngood night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they\r\nlike it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re pretty near home now. That\xe2\x80\x99s Green Gables over--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his\r\npartially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his\r\ngesture. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me guess. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll guess right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a\r\nhill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still\r\nclear in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose\r\nup against a marigold sky. Below was a little valley and beyond a long,\r\ngently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one\r\nto another the child\xe2\x80\x99s eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they\r\nlingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white\r\nwith blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it,\r\nin the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining\r\nlike a lamp of guidance and promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing.\r\n\r\nMatthew slapped the reins on the sorrel\xe2\x80\x99s back delightedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it\r\nso\xe2\x80\x99s you could tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t--really she didn\xe2\x80\x99t. All she said might just as well have\r\nbeen about most of those other places. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any real idea what it\r\nlooked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it\r\nseems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and\r\nblue from the elbow up, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve pinched myself so many times today.\r\nEvery little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I\xe2\x80\x99d pinch myself to see if it\r\nwas real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only\r\na dream I\xe2\x80\x99d better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped\r\npinching. But it _is_ real and we\xe2\x80\x99re nearly home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred\r\nuneasily. He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would\r\nhave to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was\r\nnot to be hers after all. They drove over Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s Hollow, where it was\r\nalready quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them\r\nfrom her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green\r\nGables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from\r\nthe approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was\r\nnot of Marilla or himself he was thinking of the trouble this mistake\r\nwas probably going to make for them, but of the child\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment.\r\nWhen he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had\r\nan uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering\r\nsomething--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill\r\na lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.\r\n\r\nThe yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves\r\nwere rustling silkily all round it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to the trees talking in their sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, as he\r\nlifted her to the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nice dreams they must have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained \xe2\x80\x9call her worldly\r\ngoods,\xe2\x80\x9d she followed him into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. Marilla Cuthbert is Surprised\r\n\r\n\r\n|MARILLA came briskly forward as Matthew opened the door. But when her\r\neyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the\r\nlong braids of red hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short\r\nin amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Cuthbert, who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she ejaculated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew wretchedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was only _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo boy! But there _must_ have been a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sent\r\nword to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t. She brought _her_. I asked the station-master. And I\r\nhad to bring her home. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be left there, no matter where the\r\nmistake had come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is a pretty piece of business!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Marilla.\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from\r\none to the other, all the animation fading out of her face. Suddenly\r\nshe seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said. Dropping her\r\nprecious carpet-bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want me because I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\r\nboy! I might have expected it. Nobody ever did want me. I might have\r\nknown it was all too beautiful to last. I might have known nobody really\r\ndid want me. Oh, what shall I do? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to burst into tears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBurst into tears she did. Sitting down on a chair by the table, flinging\r\nher arms out upon it, and burying her face in them, she proceeded to cry\r\nstormily. Marilla and Matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across\r\nthe stove. Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally Marilla\r\nstepped lamely into the breach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to cry so about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there _is_ need!\xe2\x80\x9d The child raised her head quickly, revealing a\r\ntear-stained face and trembling lips. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ would cry, too, if you were\r\nan orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and\r\nfound that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you because you weren\xe2\x80\x99t a boy. Oh, this is\r\nthe most _tragical_ thing that ever happened to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse,\r\nmellowed Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s grim expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to turn you out-of-doors\r\nto-night. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stay here until we investigate this affair.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you please call me Cordelia?\xe2\x80\x9d she said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Call_ you Cordelia? Is that your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-o-o, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly my name, but I would love to be called\r\nCordelia. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a perfectly elegant name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what on earth you mean. If Cordelia isn\xe2\x80\x99t your name, what\r\nis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley,\xe2\x80\x9d reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name, \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\noh, please do call me Cordelia. It can\xe2\x80\x99t matter much to you what you\r\ncall me if I\xe2\x80\x99m only going to be here a little while, can it? And Anne is\r\nsuch an unromantic name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnromantic fiddlesticks!\xe2\x80\x9d said the unsympathetic Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne is a\r\nreal good plain sensible name. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no need to be ashamed of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not ashamed of it,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Anne, \xe2\x80\x9conly I like Cordelia\r\nbetter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always imagined that my name was Cordelia--at least, I\r\nalways have of late years. When I was young I used to imagine it was\r\nGeraldine, but I like Cordelia better now. But if you call me Anne\r\nplease call me Anne spelled with an E.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference does it make how it\xe2\x80\x99s spelled?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Marilla with\r\nanother rusty smile as she picked up the teapot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it makes _such_ a difference. It _looks_ so much nicer. When you hear\r\na name pronounced can\xe2\x80\x99t you always see it in your mind, just as if it\r\nwas printed out? I can; and A-n-n looks dreadful, but A-n-n-e looks so\r\nmuch more distinguished. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll only call me Anne spelled with an E I\r\nshall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this\r\nmistake came to be made? We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy.\r\nWere there no boys at the asylum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, there was an abundance of them. But Mrs. Spencer said\r\n_distinctly_ that you wanted a girl about eleven years old. And the\r\nmatron said she thought I would do. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how delighted I was.\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep all last night for joy. Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d she added reproachfully,\r\nturning to Matthew, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me at the station that you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want me and leave me there? If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the White Way of\r\nDelight and the Lake of Shining Waters it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth does she mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Marilla, staring at Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe--she\xe2\x80\x99s just referring to some conversation we had on the road,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Matthew hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going out to put the mare in, Marilla. Have\r\ntea ready when I come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Marilla\r\nwhen Matthew had gone out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe brought Lily Jones for herself. Lily is only five years old and she\r\nis very beautiful and had nut-brown hair. If I was very beautiful and\r\nhad nut-brown hair would you keep me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of\r\nno use to us. Take off your hat. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay it and your bag on the hall\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne took off her hat meekly. Matthew came back presently and they sat\r\ndown to supper. But Anne could not eat. In vain she nibbled at the\r\nbread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little\r\nscalloped glass dish by her plate. She did not really make any headway\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not eating anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla sharply, eying her as if it\r\nwere a serious shortcoming. Anne sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you are in the\r\ndepths of despair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in the depths of despair, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d responded\r\nMarilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Well, did you ever try to _imagine_ you were in the depths\r\nof despair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can understand what it\xe2\x80\x99s like. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very\r\nuncomfortable feeling indeed. When you try to eat a lump comes right\r\nup in your throat and you can\xe2\x80\x99t swallow anything, not even if it was a\r\nchocolate caramel. I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it\r\nwas simply delicious. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often dreamed since then that I had a lot\r\nof chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I\xe2\x80\x99m going to eat\r\nthem. I do hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t be offended because I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat. Everything is\r\nextremely nice, but still I cannot eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess she\xe2\x80\x99s tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken since his return\r\nfrom the barn. \xe2\x80\x9cBest put her to bed, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla had been wondering where Anne should be put to bed. She had\r\nprepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected\r\nboy. But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the\r\nthing to put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the\r\nquestion for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable\r\nroom. Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne\r\nspiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as\r\nshe passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in\r\nwhich she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.\r\n\r\nMarilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and\r\nturned down the bedclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have a nightgown?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned.\r\n\r\nAnne nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so\r\nthings are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate\r\nskimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as\r\nin lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nconsolation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back in a\r\nfew minutes for the candle. I daren\xe2\x80\x99t trust you to put it out yourself.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d likely set the place on fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed\r\nwalls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache\r\nover their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round\r\nbraided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In\r\none corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark,\r\nlow-turned posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner\r\ntable adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the\r\npoint of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight\r\nmirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white\r\nmuslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole\r\napartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which\r\nsent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s bones. With a sob she hastily\r\ndiscarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed\r\nwhere she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes\r\nover her head. When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy\r\narticles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain\r\ntempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any\r\npresence save her own.\r\n\r\nShe deliberately picked up Anne\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, placed them neatly on a prim\r\nyellow chair, and then, taking up the candle, went over to the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a\r\nstartling suddenness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you call it a _good_ night when you know it must be the very\r\nworst night I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had?\xe2\x80\x9d she said reproachfully.\r\n\r\nThen she dived down into invisibility again.\r\n\r\nMarilla went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper\r\ndishes. Matthew was smoking--a sure sign of perturbation of mind. He\r\nseldom smoked, for Marilla set her face against it as a filthy habit;\r\nbut at certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and them Marilla\r\nwinked at the practice, realizing that a mere man must have some vent\r\nfor his emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is a pretty kettle of fish,\xe2\x80\x9d she said wrathfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nwhat comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. Richard Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfolks have twisted that message somehow. One of us will have to drive\r\nover and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow, that\xe2\x80\x99s certain. This girl will have\r\nto be sent back to the asylum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _suppose_ so! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, she\xe2\x80\x99s a real nice little thing, Marilla. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a pity\r\nto send her back when she\xe2\x80\x99s so set on staying here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Cuthbert, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you think we ought to keep\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had\r\nexpressed a predilection for standing on his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, no, I suppose not--not exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Matthew,\r\nuncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say not. What good would she be to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might be some good to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you! I can see as\r\nplain as plain that you want to keep her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, she\xe2\x80\x99s a real interesting little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Matthew.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have heard her talk coming from the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she can talk fast enough. I saw that at once. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in her\r\nfavour, either. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like children who have so much to say. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant an orphan girl and if I did she isn\xe2\x80\x99t the style I\xe2\x80\x99d pick out.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand about her. No, she\xe2\x80\x99s got to be\r\ndespatched straight-way back to where she came from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could hire a French boy to help me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, \xe2\x80\x9cand she\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\ncompany for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not suffering for company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ngoing to keep her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, it\xe2\x80\x99s just as you say, of course, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew\r\nrising and putting his pipe away. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo bed went Matthew. And to bed, when she had put her dishes away, went\r\nMarilla, frowning most resolutely. And up-stairs, in the east gable, a\r\nlonely, heart-hungry, friendless child cried herself to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. Morning at Green Gables\r\n\r\n\r\n|IT was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring\r\nconfusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was\r\npouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across\r\nglimpses of blue sky.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she could not remember where she was. First came a\r\ndelightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible\r\nremembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her because she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t a boy!\r\n\r\nBut it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside\r\nof her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor.\r\nShe pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight\r\nthat nothing was needed to hold it up.\r\n\r\nAnne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes\r\nglistening with delight. Oh, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it beautiful? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a lovely\r\nplace? Suppose she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really going to stay here! She would imagine\r\nshe was. There was scope for imagination here.\r\n\r\nA huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against\r\nthe house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf\r\nwas to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of\r\napple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms;\r\nand their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below\r\nwere lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance\r\ndrifted up to the window on the morning wind.\r\n\r\nBelow the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the\r\nhollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew,\r\nupspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful\r\npossibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it\r\nwas a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in\r\nit where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the\r\nother side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.\r\n\r\nOff to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over\r\ngreen, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily\r\nin. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child;\r\nbut this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.\r\n\r\nShe knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until\r\nshe was startled by a hand on her shoulder. Marilla had come in unheard\r\nby the small dreamer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time you were dressed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said curtly.\r\n\r\nMarilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her\r\nuncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nAnne stood up and drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it wonderful?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, waving her hand comprehensively at\r\nthe good world outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big tree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cand it blooms great, but the fruit\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t amount to much never--small and wormy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean just the tree; of course it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely--yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_radiantly_ lovely--it blooms as if it meant it--but I meant everything,\r\nthe garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods, the whole big\r\ndear world. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning\r\nlike this? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here.\r\nHave you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They\xe2\x80\x99re always\r\nlaughing. Even in winter-time I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard them under the ice. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a brook near Green Gables. Perhaps you think it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any\r\ndifference to me when you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to keep me, but it does. I shall\r\nalways like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if\r\nI never see it again. If there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a brook I\xe2\x80\x99d be _haunted_ by the\r\nuncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one. I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the depths\r\nof despair this morning. I never can be in the morning. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a\r\nsplendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\nbeen imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was\r\nto stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted.\r\nBut the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have\r\nto stop and that hurts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your\r\nimaginings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast is waiting. Wash your face and comb your hair. Leave the\r\nwindow up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed. Be as\r\nsmart as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down-stairs\r\nin ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time, with her clothes neatly on, her hair brushed and\r\nbraided, her face washed, and a comfortable consciousness pervading her\r\nsoul that she had fulfilled all Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s requirements. As a matter of\r\nfact, however, she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty hungry this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced as she slipped into the\r\nchair Marilla placed for her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem such a howling\r\nwilderness as it did last night. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad it\xe2\x80\x99s a sunshiny morning.\r\nBut I like rainy mornings real well, too. All sorts of mornings are\r\ninteresting, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen\r\nthrough the day, and there\xe2\x80\x99s so much scope for imagination. But I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad it\xe2\x80\x99s not rainy today because it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to be cheerful and bear\r\nup under affliction on a sunshiny day. I feel that I have a good deal\r\nto bear up under. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to read about sorrows and imagine\r\nyourself living through them heroically, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not so nice when you\r\nreally come to have them, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk entirely too\r\nmuch for a little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon Anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her\r\ncontinued silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of\r\nsomething not exactly natural. Matthew also held his tongue,--but this\r\nwas natural,--so that the meal was a very silent one.\r\n\r\nAs it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating\r\nmechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the\r\nsky outside the window. This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she\r\nhad an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child\xe2\x80\x99s body might\r\nbe there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy\r\ncloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination. Who would want such\r\na child about the place?\r\n\r\nYet Matthew wished to keep her, of all unaccountable things! Marilla\r\nfelt that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night\r\nbefore, and that he would go on wanting it. That was Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s way--take\r\na whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent\r\npersistency--a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its\r\nvery silence than if he had talked it out.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was ended Anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash\r\nthe dishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you wash dishes right?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Marilla distrustfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well. I\xe2\x80\x99m better at looking after children, though. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had so\r\nmuch experience at that. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a pity you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any here for me to\r\nlook after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot at present. _You\xe2\x80\x99re_ problem enough in all conscience. What\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\ndone with you I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Matthew is a most ridiculous man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is so very\r\nsympathetic. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind how much I talked--he seemed to like it. I\r\nfelt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re both queer enough, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean by kindred spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Marilla with a sniff. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may wash the dishes. Take plenty of\r\nhot water, and be sure you dry them well. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough to attend to\r\nthis morning for I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to drive over to White Sands in the afternoon\r\nand see Mrs. Spencer. You\xe2\x80\x99ll come with me and we\xe2\x80\x99ll settle what\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\ndone with you. After you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished the dishes go up-stairs and make\r\nyour bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne washed the dishes deftly enough, as Marilla who kept a sharp eye on\r\nthe process, discerned. Later on she made her bed less successfully, for\r\nshe had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick. But is\r\nwas done somehow and smoothed down; and then Marilla, to get rid of her,\r\ntold her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner time.\r\n\r\nAnne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold\r\nshe stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table,\r\nlight and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an\r\nextinguisher on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t dare go out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing\r\nall earthly joys. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here there is no use in my loving\r\nGreen Gables. And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those\r\ntrees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be able to help\r\nloving it. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard enough now, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t make it any harder. I want\r\nto go out so much--everything seems to be calling to me, \xe2\x80\x98Anne, Anne,\r\ncome out to us. Anne, Anne, we want a playmate\xe2\x80\x99--but it\xe2\x80\x99s better not.\r\nThere is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is\r\nthere? And it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to keep from loving things, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? That was\r\nwhy I was so glad when I thought I was going to live here. I thought\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me. But that brief\r\ndream is over. I am resigned to my fate now, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo out for fear I\xe2\x80\x99ll get unresigned again. What is the name of that\r\ngeranium on the window-sill, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the apple-scented geranium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that sort of a name. I mean just a name you gave it\r\nyourself. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you give it a name? May I give it one then? May I call\r\nit--let me see--Bonny would do--may I call it Bonny while I\xe2\x80\x99m here? Oh,\r\ndo let me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. But where on earth is the sense of naming a\r\ngeranium?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums. It\r\nmakes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a\r\ngeranium\xe2\x80\x99s feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I\r\nshall call it Bonny. I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window\r\nthis morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white. Of course,\r\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\none?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered\r\nMarilla, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nis kind of interesting as Matthew says. I can feel already that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwondering what on earth she\xe2\x80\x99ll say next. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be casting a spell over\r\nme, too. She\xe2\x80\x99s cast it over Matthew. That look he gave me when he went\r\nout said everything he said or hinted last night over again. I wish he\r\nwas like other men and would talk things out. A body could answer back\r\nthen and argue him into reason. But what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done with a man who\r\njust _looks?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes\r\non the sky, when Marilla returned from her cellar pilgrimage. There\r\nMarilla left her until the early dinner was on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, Matthew?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla.\r\n\r\nMatthew nodded and looked wistfully at Anne. Marilla intercepted the\r\nlook and said grimly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nAnne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send\r\nher back to Nova Scotia at once. I\xe2\x80\x99ll set your tea out for you and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe home in time to milk the cows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Matthew said nothing and Marilla had a sense of having wasted\r\nwords and breath. There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk back--unless it is a woman who won\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nMatthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and Marilla and\r\nAnne set off. Matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove\r\nslowly through, he said, to nobody in particular as it seemed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning, and I told him\r\nI guessed I\xe2\x80\x99d hire him for the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla made no reply, but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious\r\nclip with the whip that the fat mare, unused to such treatment, whizzed\r\nindignantly down the lane at an alarming pace. Marilla looked back once\r\nas the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating Matthew leaning over\r\nthe gate, looking wistfully after them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s History\r\n\r\n\r\n|DO you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne confidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind to enjoy\r\nthis drive. It\xe2\x80\x99s been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy\r\nthings if you make up your mind firmly that you will. Of course, you\r\nmust make it up _firmly_. I am not going to think about going back to\r\nthe asylum while we\xe2\x80\x99re having our drive. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to think about\r\nthe drive. Oh, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s one little early wild rose out! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nlovely? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it must be glad to be a rose? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be\r\nnice if roses could talk? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they could tell us such lovely\r\nthings. And isn\xe2\x80\x99t pink the most bewitching color in the world? I love\r\nit, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t wear it. Redheaded people can\xe2\x80\x99t wear pink, not even in\r\nimagination. Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she\r\nwas young, but got to be another color when she grew up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I ever did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla mercilessly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it likely to happen in your case either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is another hope gone. \xe2\x80\x98My life is a perfect graveyard of\r\nburied hopes.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it\r\nover to comfort myself whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed in anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see where the comforting comes in myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, because it sounds so nice and romantic, just as if I were a\r\nheroine in a book, you know. I am so fond of romantic things, and a\r\ngraveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can\r\nimagine isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99m rather glad I have one. Are we going across the\r\nLake of Shining Waters today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going over Barry\xe2\x80\x99s pond, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean by your Lake\r\nof Shining Waters. We\xe2\x80\x99re going by the shore road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShore road sounds nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne dreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it as nice as it\r\nsounds? Just when you said \xe2\x80\x98shore road\xe2\x80\x99 I saw it in a picture in my\r\nmind, as quick as that! And White Sands is a pretty name, too; but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like it as well as Avonlea. Avonlea is a lovely name. It just\r\nsounds like music. How far is it to White Sands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s five miles; and as you\xe2\x80\x99re evidently bent on talking you might as\r\nwell talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what I _know_ about myself isn\xe2\x80\x99t really worth telling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne\r\neagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll only let me tell you what I _imagine_ about myself\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll think it ever so much more interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of your imaginings. Just you stick to bald facts.\r\nBegin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was eleven last March,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts\r\nwith a little sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.\r\nMy father\xe2\x80\x99s name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the\r\nBolingbroke High School. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Bertha Shirley. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nWalter and Bertha lovely names? I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad my parents had nice names.\r\nIt would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what a person\xe2\x80\x99s name is as long as he behaves\r\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good\r\nand useful moral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne looked thoughtful. \xe2\x80\x9cI read in a book once\r\nthat a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been\r\nable to believe it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was\r\ncalled a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been\r\na good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it would\r\nhave been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school,\r\ntoo, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A\r\nhusband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were\r\na pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a\r\nweeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen that\r\nhouse, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have\r\nhad honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and\r\nlilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in\r\nall the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born\r\nin that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I\r\nwas so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I\r\nwas perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge\r\nthan a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\xe2\x80\x99m glad she\r\nwas satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a\r\ndisappointment to her--because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t live very long after that, you\r\nsee. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it\r\nwould be so sweet to say \xe2\x80\x98mother,\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t you? And father died four days\r\nafterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at\r\ntheir wits\xe2\x80\x99 end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see,\r\nnobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother\r\nhad both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nrelatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she\xe2\x80\x99d take me, though she was\r\npoor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know\r\nif there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make\r\npeople who are brought up that way better than other people? Because\r\nwhenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a\r\nbad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I\r\nlived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the\r\nThomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell\r\nyou they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed\r\nfalling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the\r\nchildren, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me. Mrs. Thomas was at _her_ wits\xe2\x80\x99 end, so\r\nshe said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came\r\ndown and said she\xe2\x80\x99d take me, seeing I was handy with children, and\r\nI went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the\r\nstumps. It was a very lonesome place. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I could never have\r\nlived there if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little\r\nsawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She had twins\r\nthree times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in\r\nsuccession is _too much_. I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last\r\npair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond\r\ndied and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children\r\namong her relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum\r\nat Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me at the\r\nasylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had\r\nto take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. Evidently\r\nshe did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not\r\nwanted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever go to school?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Marilla, turning the sorrel mare\r\ndown the shore road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a great deal. I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs.\r\nThomas. When I went up river we were so far from a school that I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer, so I\r\ncould only go in the spring and fall. But of course I went while I was\r\nat the asylum. I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of\r\npoetry off by heart--\xe2\x80\x98The Battle of Hohenlinden\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Edinburgh after\r\nFlodden,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Bingen of the Rhine,\xe2\x80\x99 and most of the \xe2\x80\x98Lady of the Lake\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand most of \xe2\x80\x98The Seasons\xe2\x80\x99 by James Thompson. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you just love poetry\r\nthat gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back? There is a piece\r\nin the Fifth Reader--\xe2\x80\x98The Downfall of Poland\xe2\x80\x99--that is just full of\r\nthrills. Of course, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the Fifth Reader--I was only in the\r\nFourth--but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere those women--Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMarilla, looking at Anne out of the corner of her eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO-o-o-h,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Anne. Her sensitive little face suddenly flushed\r\nscarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, they _meant_ to be--I know\r\nthey meant to be just as good and kind as possible. And when people\r\nmean to be good to you, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind very much when they\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nquite--always. They had a good deal to worry them, you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s  a very\r\ntrying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to\r\nhave twins three times in succession, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? But I feel sure\r\nthey meant to be good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla asked no more questions. Anne gave herself up to a silent\r\nrapture over the shore road and Marilla guided the sorrel abstractedly\r\nwhile she pondered deeply. Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for\r\nthe child. What a starved, unloved life she had had--a life of drudgery\r\nand poverty and neglect; for Marilla was shrewd enough to read between\r\nthe lines of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s history and divine the truth. No wonder she had been\r\nso delighted at the prospect of a real home. It was a pity she had to be\r\nsent back. What if she, Marilla, should indulge Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s unaccountable\r\nwhim and let her stay? He was set on it; and the child seemed a nice,\r\nteachable little thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got too much to say,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she might be trained\r\nout of that. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing rude or slangy in what she does say.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s ladylike. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely her people were nice folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shore road was \xe2\x80\x9cwoodsy and wild and lonesome.\xe2\x80\x9d On the right hand,\r\nscrub firs, their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with\r\nthe gulf winds, grew thickly. On the left were the steep red sandstone\r\ncliffs, so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than\r\nthe sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her. Down\r\nat the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy\r\ncoves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea,\r\nshimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions\r\nflashing silvery in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the sea wonderful?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, rousing from a long, wide-eyed\r\nsilence. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an express\r\nwagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away.\r\nI enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the\r\nchildren all the time. I lived it over in happy dreams for years.\r\nBut this shore is nicer than the Marysville shore. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t those gulls\r\nsplendid? Would you like to be a gull? I think I would--that is, if I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a human girl. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it would be nice to wake up at\r\nsunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue\r\nall day; and then at night to fly back to one\xe2\x80\x99s nest? Oh, I can just\r\nimagine myself doing it. What big house is that just ahead, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the White Sands Hotel. Mr. Kirke runs it, but the season hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbegun yet. There are heaps of Americans come there for the summer. They\r\nthink this shore is just about right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid it might be Mrs. Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne mournfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get there. Somehow, it will seem like the end of\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. Marilla Makes Up Her Mind\r\n\r\n\r\n|GET there they did, however, in due season. Mrs. Spencer lived in a big\r\nyellow house at White Sands Cove, and she came to the door with surprise\r\nand welcome mingled on her benevolent face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re the last folks I was looking for\r\ntoday, but I\xe2\x80\x99m real glad to see you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll put your horse in? And how\r\nare you, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as well as can be expected, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne smilelessly. A\r\nblight seemed to have descended on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we\xe2\x80\x99ll stay a little while to rest the mare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I promised Matthew I\xe2\x80\x99d be home early. The fact is, Mrs. Spencer,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s been a queer mistake somewhere, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come over to see where\r\nit is. We send word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy from the\r\nasylum. We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or\r\neleven years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla Cuthbert, you don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Spencer in distress.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you\r\nwanted a girl--didn\xe2\x80\x99t she Flora Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d appealing to her daughter who had\r\ncome out to the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe certainly did, Miss Cuthbert,\xe2\x80\x9d corroborated Flora Jane earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dreadful sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Spencer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too bad; but it certainly\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. I did the best I could and I\r\nthought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty\r\nthing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often had to scold her well for her heedlessness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was our own fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should have come\r\nto you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by\r\nword of mouth in that fashion. Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the\r\nonly thing to do is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the\r\nasylum? I suppose they\xe2\x80\x99ll take her back, won\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit will be necessary to send her back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here\r\nyesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished she\xe2\x80\x99d sent by me\r\nfor a little girl to help her. Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know,\r\nand she finds it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for you. I\r\ncall it positively providential.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with\r\nthe matter. Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome\r\norphan off her hands, and she did not even feel grateful for it.\r\n\r\nShe knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced\r\nwoman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones. But she had\r\nheard of her. \xe2\x80\x9cA terrible worker and driver,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Peter was said to\r\nbe; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and\r\nstinginess, and her family of pert, quarrelsome children. Marilla felt\r\na qualm of conscience at the thought of handing Anne over to her tender\r\nmercies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in and we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk the matter over,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed Mrs. Spencer, bustling her guests through the hall into the\r\nparlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been\r\nstrained so long through dark green, closely drawn blinds that it had\r\nlost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is real\r\nlucky, for we can settle the matter right away. Take the armchair, Miss\r\nCuthbert. Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don\xe2\x80\x99t wiggle. Let\r\nme take your hats. Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good\r\nafternoon, Mrs. Blewett. We were just saying how fortunate it was you\r\nhappened along. Let me introduce you two ladies. Mrs. Blewett, Miss\r\nCuthbert. Please excuse me for just a moment. I forgot to tell Flora\r\nJane to take the buns out of the oven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. Anne sitting\r\nmutely on the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared\r\nat Mrs Blewett as one fascinated. Was she to be given into the keeping\r\nof this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? She felt a lump coming up in her\r\nthroat and her eyes smarted painfully. She was beginning to be afraid\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed\r\nand beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,\r\nmental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems there\xe2\x80\x99s been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted\r\na little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems it was a\r\nboy they wanted. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re still of the same mind you were yesterday,\r\nI think she\xe2\x80\x99ll be just the thing for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you and what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any\r\nstipulations regarding the spelling thereof, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m eleven years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! You don\xe2\x80\x99t look as if there was much to you. But you\xe2\x80\x99re wiry. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know but the wiry ones are the best after all. Well, if I take you\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be a good girl, you know--good and smart and respectful.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake about that. Yes, I\r\nsuppose I might as well take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert. The\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s awful fractious, and I\xe2\x80\x99m clean worn out attending to him. If you\r\nlike I can take her right home now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child\xe2\x80\x99s pale face\r\nwith its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature\r\nwho finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.\r\nMarilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal\r\nof that look, it would haunt her to her dying day. More-over, she did\r\nnot fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, \xe2\x80\x9chighstrung\xe2\x80\x9d child over to\r\nsuch a woman! No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that Matthew and I\r\nhad absolutely decided that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep her. In fact I may say that\r\nMatthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to find out how the\r\nmistake had occurred. I think I\xe2\x80\x99d better take her home again and talk it\r\nover with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to decide on anything without\r\nconsulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we\xe2\x80\x99ll bring or\r\nsend her over to you tomorrow night. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t you may know that she\r\nis going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99ll have to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Blewett ungraciously.\r\n\r\nDuring Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s speech a sunrise had been dawning on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face. First\r\nthe look of despair faded out; then came a faint flush of hope;\r\nher eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars. The child was quite\r\ntransfigured; and, a moment later, when Mrs. Spencer and Mrs. Blewett\r\nwent out in quest of a recipe the latter had come to borrow she sprang\r\nup and flew across the room to Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you would let me\r\nstay at Green Gables?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a breathless whisper, as if speaking\r\naloud might shatter the glorious possibility. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you really say it? Or\r\ndid I only imagine that you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d better learn to control that imagination of yours, Anne,\r\nif you can\xe2\x80\x99t distinguish between what is real and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla crossly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did hear me say just that and no more. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to let Mrs. Blewett take\r\nyou after all. She certainly needs you much more than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne\r\npassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cShe looks exactly like a--like a gimlet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla smothered a smile under the conviction that Anne must be\r\nreproved for such a speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and\r\na stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d she said severely. \xe2\x80\x9cGo back and sit down quietly and hold\r\nyour tongue and behave as a good girl should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do and be anything you want me, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only keep me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Anne, returning meekly to her ottoman.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived back at Green Gables that evening Matthew met them in\r\nthe lane. Marilla from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed\r\nhis motive. She was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he\r\nsaw that she had at least brought back Anne back with her. But she said\r\nnothing, to him, relative to the affair, until they were both out in the\r\nyard behind the barn milking the cows. Then she briefly told him Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory and the result of the interview with Mrs. Spencer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew with\r\nunusual vim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy her style myself,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nor keeping her ourselves, Matthew. And since you seem to want her, I\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99m willing--or have to be. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking over the idea\r\nuntil I\xe2\x80\x99ve got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nbrought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a\r\nterrible mess of it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best. So far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned,\r\nMatthew, she may stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew\xe2\x80\x99s shy face was a glow of delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I reckoned you\xe2\x80\x99d come to see it in that light, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s such an interesting little thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99d be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little\r\nthing,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it my business to see she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrained to be that. And mind, Matthew, you\xe2\x80\x99re not to go interfering with\r\nmy methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about bringing up\r\na child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you just\r\nleave me to manage her. When I fail it\xe2\x80\x99ll be time enough to put your oar\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew\r\nreassuringly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly be as good and kind to her as you can without\r\nspoiling her. I kind of think she\xe2\x80\x99s one of the sort you can do anything\r\nwith if you only get her to love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla sniffed, to express her contempt for Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s opinions\r\nconcerning anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the\r\npails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell her tonight that she can stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she reflected, as she\r\nstrained the milk into the creamers. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d be so excited that she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep a wink. Marilla Cuthbert, you\xe2\x80\x99re fairly in for it. Did\r\nyou ever suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d see the day when you\xe2\x80\x99d be adopting an orphan\r\ngirl? It\xe2\x80\x99s surprising enough; but not so surprising as that Matthew\r\nshould be at the bottom of it, him that always seemed to have such a\r\nmortal dread of little girls. Anyhow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided on the experiment\r\nand goodness only knows what will come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. Anne Says Her Prayers\r\n\r\n\r\n|WHEN Marilla took Anne up to bed that night she said stiffly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Anne, I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about\r\nthe floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t allow it at all. As soon as you take off any article of clothing\r\nfold it neatly and place it on the chair. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any use at all for\r\nlittle girls who aren\xe2\x80\x99t neat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think about my\r\nclothes at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fold them nicely tonight. They always\r\nmade us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I\xe2\x80\x99d forget, I\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nin such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to remember a little better if you stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d admonished\r\nMarilla. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that looks something like. Say your prayers now and get\r\ninto bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never say any prayers,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Anne.\r\n\r\nMarilla looked horrified astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?\r\nGod always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know who\r\nGod is, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His being,\r\nwisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d responded Anne\r\npromptly and glibly.\r\n\r\nMarilla looked rather relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you do know something then, thank goodness! You\xe2\x80\x99re not quite a\r\nheathen. Where did you learn that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole\r\ncatechism. I liked it pretty well. There\xe2\x80\x99s something splendid about some\r\nof the words. \xe2\x80\x98Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.\xe2\x80\x99 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that grand? It\r\nhas such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\ncall it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about poetry, Anne--we are talking about saying your\r\nprayers. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible wicked thing not to say your\r\nprayers every night? I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you are a very bad little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAnne reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who haven\xe2\x80\x99t red hair don\xe2\x80\x99t know what trouble\r\nis. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red _on purpose_, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever cared about Him since. And anyhow I\xe2\x80\x99d always be too tired at night\r\nto bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nexpected to say their prayers. Now, do you honestly think they can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla decided that Anne\xe2\x80\x99s religious training must be begun at once.\r\nPlainly there was no time to be lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course, if you want me to,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Anne cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do\r\nanything to oblige you. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to tell me what to say for this\r\nonce. After I get into bed I\xe2\x80\x99ll imagine out a real nice prayer to say\r\nalways. I believe that it will be quite interesting, now that I come to\r\nthink of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must kneel down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla in embarrassment.\r\n\r\nAnne knelt at Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s knee and looked up gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you what I\xe2\x80\x99d do. I\xe2\x80\x99d go out into a great big field all alone\r\nor into the deep, deep, woods, and I\xe2\x80\x99d look up into the\r\nsky--up--up--up--into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no\r\nend to its blueness. And then I\xe2\x80\x99d just _feel_ a prayer. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\r\nWhat am I to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla felt more embarrassed than ever. She had intended to teach Anne\r\nthe childish classic, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I lay me down to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d But she had, as\r\nI have told you, the glimmerings of a sense of humor--which is simply\r\nanother name for a sense of fitness of things; and it suddenly occurred\r\nto her that that simple little prayer, sacred to white-robed childhood\r\nlisping at motherly knees, was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch\r\nof a girl who knew and cared nothing about God\xe2\x80\x99s love, since she had\r\nnever had it translated to her through the medium of human love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re old enough to pray for yourself, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said finally. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nthank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the things you\r\nwant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best,\xe2\x80\x9d promised Anne, burying her face in Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlap. \xe2\x80\x9cGracious heavenly Father--that\xe2\x80\x99s the way the ministers say it in\r\nchurch, so I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s all right in private prayer, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninterjected, lifting her head for a moment.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cGracious heavenly Father, I thank Thee for the White\r\n   Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters and Bonny\r\n   and the Snow Queen. I\xe2\x80\x99m really extremely grateful for\r\n   them. And that\xe2\x80\x99s all the blessings I can think of just\r\n   now to thank Thee for. As for the things I want,\r\n   they\xe2\x80\x99re so numerous that it would take a great deal of\r\n   time to name them all so I will only mention the two\r\n   most important. Please let me stay at Green Gables;\r\n   and please let me be good-looking when I grow up.\r\n   I remain,\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cYours respectfully,\r\n                       Anne Shirley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, did I do all right?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked eagerly, getting up. \xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nhave made it much more flowery if I\xe2\x80\x99d had a little more time to think it\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering\r\nthat it was not irreverence, but simply spiritual ignorance on the part\r\nof Anne that was responsible for this extraordinary petition. She tucked\r\nthe child up in bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer\r\nthe very next day, and was leaving the room with the light when Anne\r\ncalled her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just thought of it now. I should have said, \xe2\x80\x98Amen\xe2\x80\x99 in place\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98yours respectfully,\xe2\x80\x99 shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?--the way the ministers do. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nforgotten it, but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so\r\nI put in the other. Do you suppose it will make any difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose it will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to sleep now like a good\r\nchild. Good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne,\r\ncuddling luxuriously down among her pillows.\r\n\r\nMarilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table,\r\nand glared at Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Cuthbert, it\xe2\x80\x99s about time somebody adopted that child and\r\ntaught her something. She\xe2\x80\x99s next door to a perfect heathen. Will you\r\nbelieve that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight? I\xe2\x80\x99ll send\r\nher to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ll do. And she shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can\r\nget some suitable clothes made for her. I foresee that I shall have\r\nmy hands full. Well, well, we can\xe2\x80\x99t get through this world without our\r\nshare of trouble. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a pretty easy life of it so far, but my time\r\nhas come at last and I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to make the best of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s Bringing-up Is Begun\r\n\r\n\r\n|FOR reasons best known to herself, Marilla did not tell Anne that\r\nshe was to stay at Green Gables until the next afternoon. During the\r\nforenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her\r\nwith a keen eye while she did them. By noon she had concluded that Anne\r\nwas smart and obedient, willing to work and quick to learn; her most\r\nserious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in\r\nthe middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was\r\nsharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWhen Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted\r\nMarilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to\r\nlearn the worst. Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her\r\nface flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she\r\nclasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me if you are going to send\r\nme away or not? I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be patient all the morning, but I really\r\nfeel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful feeling.\r\nPlease tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla immovably. \xe2\x80\x9cJust go and do it before you ask any more\r\nquestions, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla\r\nand fastened imploring eyes of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla,\r\nunable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep\r\nyou--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself\r\ngrateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m crying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think why.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m glad as glad can be. Oh, _glad_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem the right word at all. I\r\nwas glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms--but this! Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething more than glad. I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to be so good. It\r\nwill be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was\r\ndesperately wicked. However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my very best. But can you tell me\r\nwhy I\xe2\x80\x99m crying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re all excited and worked up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla\r\ndisapprovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. Yes, you can stay here and\r\nwe will try to do right by you. You must go to school; but it\xe2\x80\x99s only a\r\nfortnight till vacation so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth while for you to start before\r\nit opens again in September.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to call you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I always say Miss Cuthbert?\r\nCan I call you Aunt Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you\xe2\x80\x99ll call me just plain Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to being called\r\nMiss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess there\xe2\x80\x99ll be nothing disrespectful in it if you\xe2\x80\x99re careful\r\nto speak respectfully. Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me\r\nMarilla except the minister. He says Miss Cuthbert--when he thinks of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to call you Aunt Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne wistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nhad an aunt or any relation at all--not even a grandmother. It would\r\nmake me feel as if I really belonged to you. Can\xe2\x80\x99t I call you Aunt\r\nMarilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m not your aunt and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in calling people names that\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t belong to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we could imagine you were my aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you never imagine things different from what they really are?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nAnne wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne drew a long breath. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss--Marilla, how much you miss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in imagining things different from what they really\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Lord puts us in certain circumstances\r\nHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me. Go\r\ninto the sitting room, Anne--be sure your feet are clean and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that\xe2\x80\x99s on the\r\nmantelpiece. The Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer is on it and you\xe2\x80\x99ll devote your spare\r\ntime this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There\xe2\x80\x99s to be no more\r\nof such praying as I heard last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I was very awkward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cbut then, you\r\nsee, I\xe2\x80\x99d never had any practice. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really expect a person\r\nto pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a\r\nsplendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would.\r\nIt was nearly as long as a minister\xe2\x80\x99s and so poetical. But would you\r\nbelieve it? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember one word when I woke up this morning.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll never be able to think out another one as good.\r\nSomehow, things never are so good when they\xe2\x80\x99re thought out a second\r\ntime. Have you ever noticed that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do\r\na thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and\r\ndiscourse about it. Just you go and do as I bid you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed\r\nto return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting\r\nand marched after her with a grim expression. She found Anne standing\r\nmotionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows,\r\nwith her eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained\r\nthrough apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt\r\nlittle figure with a half-unearthly radiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, whatever are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Marilla sharply.\r\n\r\nAnne came back to earth with a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo\r\nentitled, \xe2\x80\x9cChrist Blessing Little Children\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cand I was just imagining I\r\nwas one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing\r\noff by herself in the corner as if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to anybody, like\r\nme. She looks lonely and sad, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? I guess she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nfather or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she\r\njust crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would\r\nnotice her--except Him. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I know just how she felt. Her heart\r\nmust have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I\r\nasked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t notice her. But\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s likely He did, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to imagine it all\r\nout--her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close\r\nto Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair and\r\noh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her! But I wish the artist\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t painted Him so sorrowful looking. All His pictures are like that,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe He could really have looked so\r\nsad or the children would have been afraid of Him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this speech\r\nlong before, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk that way. It\xe2\x80\x99s irreverent--positively\r\nirreverent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes marveled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I felt just as reverent as could be. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be\r\nirreverent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you did--but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right to talk so\r\nfamiliarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I send you\r\nafter something you\xe2\x80\x99re to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and\r\nimagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come right\r\nto the kitchen. Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had\r\nbrought in to decorate the dinner-table--Marilla had eyed that\r\ndecoration askance, but had said nothing--propped her chin on her hands,\r\nand fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced at length. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it\r\nbefore--I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it\r\nover once. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it then. He had such a cracked voice and\r\nhe prayed it so mournfully. I really felt sure he thought praying was a\r\ndisagreeable duty. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t poetry, but it makes me feel just the same\r\nway poetry does. \xe2\x80\x98Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThat is just like a line of music. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you thought of making\r\nme learn this, Miss--Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, learn it and hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla shortly.\r\n\r\nAnne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft\r\nkiss on a pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded presently, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think that I shall ever have\r\na bosom friend in Avonlea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA--a what kind of friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bosom friend--an intimate friend, you know--a really kindred spirit\r\nto whom I can confide my inmost soul. I\xe2\x80\x99ve dreamed of meeting her all\r\nmy life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest\r\ndreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do\r\nyou think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she\xe2\x80\x99s about your age. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when\r\nshe comes home. She\xe2\x80\x99s visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a\r\nvery particular woman. She won\xe2\x80\x99t let Diana play with any little girl who\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t nice and good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Diana like? Her hair isn\xe2\x80\x99t red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It\xe2\x80\x99s bad\r\nenough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn\xe2\x80\x99t endure it in a\r\nbosom friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and\r\nrosy cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being\r\npretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was\r\nfirmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a\r\nchild who was being brought up.\r\n\r\nBut Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the\r\ndelightful possibilities before it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom\r\nfriend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting\r\nroom with glass doors. There weren\xe2\x80\x99t any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept\r\nher best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to\r\nkeep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night\r\nwhen he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to\r\npretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in\r\nit. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to\r\ntalk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.\r\nKatie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend\r\nthat the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I\r\ncould open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice\r\nlived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 shelves of preserves and china. And\r\nthen Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a\r\nwonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have\r\nlived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond\r\nit just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,\r\ntoo, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye\r\nthrough the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond\xe2\x80\x99s. But\r\njust up the river a little way from the house there was a long green\r\nlittle valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every\r\nword you said, even if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it\r\nwas a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved\r\nher almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you\r\nknow. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta,\r\nand oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had\r\nbecome so attached to her that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to imagine a bosom\r\nfriend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s just as well there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla drily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own\r\nimaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to\r\nput such nonsense out of your head. But don\xe2\x80\x99t let Mrs. Barry hear you\r\ntalking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she\xe2\x80\x99ll think you\r\ntell stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk of them to everybody--their memories are\r\ntoo sacred for that. But I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have you know about them.\r\nOh, look, here\xe2\x80\x99s a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom. Just\r\nthink what a lovely place to live--in an apple blossom! Fancy going to\r\nsleep in it when the wind was rocking it. If I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a human girl I\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be a bee and live among the flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday you wanted to be a sea gull,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\r\nare very fickle minded. I told you to learn that prayer and not talk.\r\nBut it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got anybody\r\nthat will listen to you. So go up to your room and learn it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know it pretty nearly all now--all but just the last line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind, do as I tell you. Go to your room and finish learning\r\nit well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I take the apple blossoms with me for company?\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you don\xe2\x80\x99t want your room cluttered up with flowers. You should have\r\nleft them on the tree in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did feel a little that way, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI kind of felt I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation was\r\n_irresistible_. What do you do when you meet with an irresistible\r\ntemptation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming\r\nupstairs. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to imagine things into this room so that they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nalways stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet\r\nwith pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the\r\nwindows. The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The\r\nfurniture is mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound _so_\r\nluxurious. This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions,\r\npink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it.\r\nI can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall.\r\nI am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a\r\npearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair. My hair is of midnight\r\ndarkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor. My name is the Lady\r\nCordelia Fitzgerald. No, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t--I can\xe2\x80\x99t make _that_ seem real.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her\r\npointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re only Anne of Green Gables,\xe2\x80\x9d she said earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I see you,\r\njust as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I\xe2\x80\x99m the Lady\r\nCordelia. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than\r\nAnne of nowhere in particular, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent forward, kissed her reflection affectionately, and betook\r\nherself to the open window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Snow Queen, good afternoon. And good afternoon dear birches down\r\nin the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I\r\nwonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall\r\nlove her very much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice\r\nand Violetta. They would feel so hurt if I did and I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to hurt\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, even a little bookcase girl\xe2\x80\x99s or a little echo\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s. I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry\r\nblossoms and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out\r\non a sea of daydreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. Mrs. Rachel Lynde Is Properly Horrified\r\n\r\n\r\n|ANNE had been a fortnight at Green Gables before Mrs. Lynde arrived to\r\ninspect her. Mrs. Rachel, to do her justice, was not to blame for this.\r\nA severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady\r\nto her house ever since the occasion of her last visit to Green Gables.\r\nMrs. Rachel was not often sick and had a well-defined contempt for\r\npeople who were; but grippe, she asserted, was like no other illness on\r\nearth and could only be interpreted as one of the special visitations\r\nof Providence. As soon as her doctor allowed her to put her foot\r\nout-of-doors she hurried up to Green Gables, bursting with curiosity to\r\nsee Matthew and Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s orphan, concerning whom all sorts of stories\r\nand suppositions had gone abroad in Avonlea.\r\n\r\nAnne had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight. Already\r\nshe was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place. She had\r\ndiscovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up\r\nthrough a belt of woodland; and she had explored it to its furthest end\r\nin all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge, fir coppice and wild\r\ncherry arch, corners thick with fern, and branching byways of maple and\r\nmountain ash.\r\n\r\nShe had made friends with the spring down in the hollow--that wonderful\r\ndeep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red sandstones\r\nand rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and beyond it was\r\na log bridge over the brook.\r\n\r\nThat bridge led Anne\xe2\x80\x99s dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond, where\r\nperpetual twilight reigned under the straight, thick-growing firs and\r\nspruces; the only flowers there were myriads of delicate \xe2\x80\x9cJune bells,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms, and a few pale, aerial\r\nstarflowers, like the spirits of last year\xe2\x80\x99s blossoms. Gossamers\r\nglimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and\r\ntassels seemed to utter friendly speech.\r\n\r\nAll these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half\r\nhours which she was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and\r\nMarilla half-deaf over her discoveries. Not that Matthew complained, to\r\nbe sure; he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his\r\nface; Marilla permitted the \xe2\x80\x9cchatter\xe2\x80\x9d until she found herself becoming\r\ntoo interested in it, whereupon she always promptly quenched Anne by a\r\ncurt command to hold her tongue.\r\n\r\nAnne was out in the orchard when Mrs. Rachel came, wandering at her\r\nown sweet will through the lush, tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy\r\nevening sunshine; so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk\r\nher illness fully over, describing every ache and pulse beat with\r\nsuch evident enjoyment that Marilla thought even grippe must bring its\r\ncompensations. When details were exhausted Mrs. Rachel introduced the\r\nreal reason of her call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m getting over my surprise now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was too bad there was such a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Rachel\r\nsympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have sent her back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her.\r\nAnd I must say I like her myself--although I admit she has her faults.\r\nThe house seems a different place already. She\xe2\x80\x99s a real bright little\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she\r\nread disapproval in Mrs. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great responsibility you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken on yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said that\r\nlady gloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially when you\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any experience with\r\nchildren. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about her or her real disposition, I\r\nsuppose, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no guessing how a child like that will turn out.\r\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to discourage you I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling discouraged,\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s dry response, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I make\r\nup my mind to do a thing it stays made up. I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see\r\nAnne. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call her in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of\r\nher orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in\r\nthe unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside\r\nthe door. She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short\r\ntight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin\r\nlegs seemed ungracefully long. Her freckles were more numerous and\r\nobtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into\r\nover-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick you for your looks, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure and certain,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was Mrs. Rachel Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s emphatic comment. Mrs. Rachel was one of those\r\ndelightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their\r\nmind without fear or favor. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s terrible skinny and homely, Marilla.\r\nCome here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart, did\r\nany one ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! Come here,\r\nchild, I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne \xe2\x80\x9ccame there,\xe2\x80\x9d but not exactly as Mrs. Rachel expected. With one\r\nbound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before Mrs. Rachel, her\r\nface scarlet with anger, her lips quivering, and her whole slender form\r\ntrembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate you,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in a choked voice, stamping her foot on the\r\nfloor. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate you--I hate you--I hate you--\xe2\x80\x9d a louder stamp with each\r\nassertion of hatred. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you call me skinny and ugly? How dare\r\nyou say I\xe2\x80\x99m freckled and redheaded? You are a rude, impolite, unfeeling\r\nwoman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Marilla in consternation.\r\n\r\nBut Anne continued to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes\r\nblazing, hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her like\r\nan atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you say such things about me?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nwould you like to have such things said about you? How would you like\r\nto be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a spark of\r\nimagination in you? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if I do hurt your feelings by saying\r\nso! I hope I hurt them. You have hurt mine worse than they were ever\r\nhurt before even by Mrs. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 intoxicated husband. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll _never_\r\nforgive you for it, never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStamp! Stamp!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anybody ever see such a temper!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the horrified Mrs.\r\nRachel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne go to your room and stay there until I come up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla,\r\nrecovering her powers of speech with difficulty.\r\n\r\nAnne, bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the\r\ntins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the\r\nhall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that\r\nthe door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t envy you your job bringing _that_ up, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nRachel with unspeakable solemnity.\r\n\r\nMarilla opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or\r\ndeprecation. What she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have twitted her about her looks, Rachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla Cuthbert, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that you are upholding her in\r\nsuch a terrible display of temper as we\xe2\x80\x99ve just seen?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mrs.\r\nRachel indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to excuse her. She\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nvery naughty and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to give her a talking to about it. But we\r\nmust make allowances for her. She\xe2\x80\x99s never been taught what is right. And\r\nyou _were_ too hard on her, Rachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla could not help tacking on that last sentence, although she was\r\nagain surprised at herself for doing it. Mrs. Rachel got up with an air\r\nof offended dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I see that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be very careful what I say after this,\r\nMarilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness\r\nknows where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nvexed--don\xe2\x80\x99t worry yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99m too sorry for you to leave any room for\r\nanger in my mind. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have your own troubles with that child. But\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll take my advice--which I suppose you won\xe2\x80\x99t do, although I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought up ten children and buried two--you\xe2\x80\x99ll do that \xe2\x80\x98talking to\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\nmention with a fair-sized birch switch. I should think _that_ would be the\r\nmost effective language for that kind of a child. Her temper matches her\r\nhair I guess. Well, good evening, Marilla. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll come down to\r\nsee me often as usual. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to visit here again in a\r\nhurry, if I\xe2\x80\x99m liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething new in _my_ experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away--if a fat woman who always\r\nwaddled _could_ be said to sweep away--and Marilla with a very solemn face\r\nbetook herself to the east gable.\r\n\r\nOn the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do.\r\nShe felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted.\r\nHow unfortunate that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs.\r\nRachel Lynde, of all people! Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an\r\nuncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation\r\nover this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect\r\nin Anne\xe2\x80\x99s disposition. And how was she to punish her? The amiable\r\nsuggestion of the birch switch--to the efficiency of which all of Mrs.\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s own children could have borne smarting testimony--did not\r\nappeal to Marilla. She did not believe she could whip a child. No,\r\nsome other method of punishment must be found to bring Anne to a proper\r\nrealization of the enormity of her offense.\r\n\r\nMarilla found Anne face downward on her bed, crying bitterly, quite\r\noblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said not ungently.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne,\xe2\x80\x9d with greater severity, \xe2\x80\x9cget off that bed this minute and listen\r\nto what I have to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it, her face\r\nswollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a nice way for you to behave. Anne! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any right to call me ugly and redheaded,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Anne,\r\nevasive and defiant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did\r\nto her, Anne. I was ashamed of you--thoroughly ashamed of you. I\r\nwanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have\r\ndisgraced me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you should lose your temper like\r\nthat just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You\r\nsay it yourself often enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but there\xe2\x80\x99s such a difference between saying a thing yourself and\r\nhearing other people say it,\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may know a thing is\r\nso, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t help hoping other people don\xe2\x80\x99t quite think it is. I\r\nsuppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. When\r\nshe said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me.\r\nI _had_ to fly out at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say. Mrs. Lynde\r\nwill have a nice story to tell about you everywhere--and she\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nit, too. It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that,\r\nAnne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that\r\nyou were skinny and ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Anne tearfully.\r\n\r\nAn old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla. She had been a very\r\nsmall child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\npity she is such a dark, homely little thing.\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla was every day of\r\nfifty before the sting had gone out of that memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what\r\nshe did to you, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted in a softer tone. \xe2\x80\x9cRachel is too\r\noutspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She\r\nwas a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor--all three very good\r\nreasons why you should have been respectful to her. You were rude and\r\nsaucy and\xe2\x80\x9d--Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment--\xe2\x80\x9cyou must go\r\nto her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her\r\nto forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can never do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne determinedly and darkly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\npunish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark,\r\ndamp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and\r\nwater and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Marilla drily, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially as they\xe2\x80\x99re rather scarce in Avonlea. But\r\napologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here in your\r\nroom until you can tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to stay here forever then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell Mrs. Lynde I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I said those things to her. How can\r\nI? I\xe2\x80\x99m _not_ sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99ve vexed you; but I\xe2\x80\x99m _glad_ I told her just\r\nwhat I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry when I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot, can I? I can\xe2\x80\x99t even _imagine_ I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, rising to depart. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have the night to\r\nthink over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You said\r\nyou would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but\r\nI must say it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seemed very much like it this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s stormy bosom, Marilla\r\ndescended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in\r\nsoul. She was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she\r\nrecalled Mrs. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with\r\namusement and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s Apology\r\n\r\n\r\n|MARILLA said nothing to Matthew about the affair that evening; but when\r\nAnne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be\r\nmade to account for her absence from the breakfast table. Marilla told\r\nMatthew the whole story, taking pains to impress him with a due sense of\r\nthe enormity of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she\xe2\x80\x99s a meddlesome\r\nold gossip,\xe2\x80\x9d was Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s consolatory rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Cuthbert, I\xe2\x80\x99m astonished at you. You know that Anne\xe2\x80\x99s behavior\r\nwas dreadful, and yet you take her part! I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll be saying next\r\nthing that she oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be punished at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now--no--not exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon she\r\nought to be punished a little. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard on her, Marilla.\r\nRecollect she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ever had anyone to teach her right. You\xe2\x80\x99re--you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to give her something to eat, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n demanded Marilla indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll have her meals regular, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll carry them up to her myself. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll stay up there until she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwilling to apologize to Mrs. Lynde, and that\xe2\x80\x99s final, Matthew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBreakfast, dinner, and supper were very silent meals--for Anne still\r\nremained obdurate. After each meal Marilla carried a well-filled tray\r\nto the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted.\r\nMatthew eyed its last descent with a troubled eye. Had Anne eaten\r\nanything at all?\r\n\r\nWhen Marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back\r\npasture, Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching,\r\nslipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs. As\r\na general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little\r\nbedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured\r\nuncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to\r\ntea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he\r\nhelped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.\r\n\r\nHe tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the\r\ndoor of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his\r\nfingers and then open the door to peep in.\r\n\r\nAnne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out\r\ninto the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nsmote him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, \xe2\x80\x9chow are you\r\nmaking it, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne smiled wanly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of\r\ncourse, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary\r\nimprisonment before her.\r\n\r\nMatthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without\r\nloss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. \xe2\x80\x9cWell now, Anne, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think you\xe2\x80\x99d better do it and have it over with?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne. Do it right off,\r\nI say, and have it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--apologize--that\xe2\x80\x99s the very word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nsmooth it over so to speak. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was trying to get at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I could do it to oblige you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all\r\nnight. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just\r\nfurious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in a temper\r\nanymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed\r\nof myself. But I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde\r\nso. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I\xe2\x80\x99d stay shut up here\r\nforever rather than do that. But still--I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything for you--if you\r\nreally want me to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, of course I do. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible lonesome downstairs without\r\nyou. Just go and smooth things over--that\xe2\x80\x99s a good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne resignedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Marilla as soon as she\r\ncomes in I\xe2\x80\x99ve repented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right--that\xe2\x80\x99s right, Anne. But don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Marilla I said\r\nanything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I\r\npromised not to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWild horses won\xe2\x80\x99t drag the secret from me,\xe2\x80\x9d promised Anne solemnly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Matthew was gone, scared at his own success. He fled hastily to the\r\nremotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what\r\nhe had been up to. Marilla herself, upon her return to the house, was\r\nagreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling, \xe2\x80\x9cMarilla\xe2\x80\x9d over\r\nthe banisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going into the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I lost my temper and said rude things, and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to go\r\nand tell Mrs. Lynde so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s crispness gave no sign of her relief. She had\r\nbeen wondering what under the canopy she should do if Anne did not give\r\nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you down after milking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after milking, behold Marilla and Anne walking down the\r\nlane, the former erect and triumphant, the latter drooping and dejected.\r\nBut halfway down Anne\xe2\x80\x99s dejection vanished as if by enchantment. She\r\nlifted her head and stepped lightly along, her eyes fixed on the sunset\r\nsky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her. Marilla beheld the\r\nchange disapprovingly. This was no meek penitent such as it behooved her\r\nto take into the presence of the offended Mrs. Lynde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anne\r\ndreamily.\r\n\r\nThis was satisfactory--or should have been so. But Marilla could not\r\nrid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was\r\ngoing askew. Anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant.\r\n\r\nRapt and radiant Anne continued until they were in the very presence\r\nof Mrs. Lynde, who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window. Then the\r\nradiance vanished. Mournful penitence appeared on every feature. Before\r\na word was spoken Anne suddenly went down on her knees before the\r\nastonished Mrs. Rachel and held out her hands beseechingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a quiver in\r\nher voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up\r\na whole dictionary. You must just imagine it. I behaved terribly to\r\nyou--and I\xe2\x80\x99ve disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have\r\nlet me stay at Green Gables although I\xe2\x80\x99m not a boy. I\xe2\x80\x99m a dreadfully\r\nwicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out\r\nby respectable people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a\r\ntemper because you told me the truth. It _was_ the truth; every word you\r\nsaid was true. My hair is red and I\xe2\x80\x99m freckled and skinny and ugly.\r\nWhat I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said it. Oh, Mrs.\r\nLynde, please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong\r\nsorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a\r\ndreadful temper? Oh, I am sure you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Please say you forgive me,\r\nMrs. Lynde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne clasped her hands together, bowed her head, and waited for the word\r\nof judgment.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking her sincerity--it breathed in every tone of her\r\nvoice. Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring.\r\nBut the former under-stood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying\r\nher valley of humiliation--was reveling in the thoroughness of her\r\nabasement. Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla,\r\nhad plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nGood Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see\r\nthis. She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and\r\nall resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, get up, child,\xe2\x80\x9d she said heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I forgive\r\nyou. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I\xe2\x80\x99m such an\r\noutspoken person. You just mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind me, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndenied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once--went to school\r\nwith her, in fact--whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she\r\nwas young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a mite surprised if yours did, too--not a mite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mrs. Lynde!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh,\r\nI could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome\r\nauburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair was a handsome auburn, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? And now may I go out into\r\nyour garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and\r\nMarilla are talking? There is so much more scope for imagination out\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws, yes, run along, child. And you can pick a bouquet of them white\r\nJune lilies over in the corner if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind Anne Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla; it\xe2\x80\x99s easier\r\nthan the one you\xe2\x80\x99ve got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit\r\non. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of\r\ntaking about her after all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so surprised at you and Matthew\r\nkeeping her as I did--nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn out all\r\nright. Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself--a little\r\ntoo--well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she\xe2\x80\x99ll likely get over\r\nthat now that she\xe2\x80\x99s come to live among civilized folks. And then, her\r\ntemper\xe2\x80\x99s pretty quick, I guess; but there\xe2\x80\x99s one comfort, a child that\r\nhas a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain\xe2\x80\x99t never likely to\r\nbe sly or deceitful. Preserve me from a sly child, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. On the\r\nwhole, Marilla, I kind of like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the\r\norchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI apologized pretty well, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d she said proudly as they went\r\ndown the lane. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought since I had to do it I might as well do it\r\nthoroughly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did it thoroughly, all right enough,\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s comment.\r\nMarilla was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the\r\nrecollection. She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold\r\nAnne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She\r\ncompromised with her conscience by saying severely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll try to control your temper now, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard if people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t twit me about my looks,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Anne with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t get cross about other things; but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n_so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right\r\nover. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I\r\ngrow up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so much about your looks, Anne. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you are\r\na very vain little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I be vain when I know I\xe2\x80\x99m homely?\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI love\r\npretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look\r\nat any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome is as handsome does,\xe2\x80\x9d quoted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had that said\r\nto me before, but I have my doubts about it,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked skeptical Anne,\r\nsniffing at her narcissi. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, aren\xe2\x80\x99t these flowers sweet! It was lovely\r\nof Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs.\r\nLynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and\r\nbe forgiven, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t the stars bright tonight? If you could\r\nlive in a star, which one would you pick? I\xe2\x80\x99d like that lovely clear big\r\none away over there above that dark hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, do hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to\r\nfollow the gyrations of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts.\r\n\r\nAnne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy\r\nwind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young\r\ndew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out\r\nthrough the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came\r\nclose to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman\xe2\x80\x99s hard palm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lovely to be going home and know it\xe2\x80\x99s home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love\r\nGreen Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever\r\nseemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy. I could pray right now and\r\nnot find it a bit hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s heart at touch of\r\nthat thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had\r\nmissed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed\r\nher. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by\r\ninculcating a moral.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good girl you\xe2\x80\x99ll always be happy, Anne. And you should\r\nnever find it hard to say your prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaying one\xe2\x80\x99s prayers isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the same thing as praying,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAnne meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m going to imagine that I\xe2\x80\x99m the wind that is\r\nblowing up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nimagine I\xe2\x80\x99m gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll fly over\r\nto Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nwith one great swoop over the clover field--and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll blow over the\r\nLake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.\r\nOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I\xe2\x80\x99ll not talk\r\nany more just now, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks be to goodness for that,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Marilla in devout relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s Impressions of Sunday-School\r\n\r\n\r\n|WELL, how do you like them?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla.\r\n\r\nAnne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new\r\ndresses spread out on the bed. One was of snuffy colored gingham which\r\nMarilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer\r\nbecause it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered\r\nsateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and\r\none was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that\r\nweek at a Carmody store.\r\n\r\nShe had made them up herself, and they were all made alike--plain skirts\r\nfulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt\r\nand tight as sleeves could be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll imagine that I like them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne soberly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to imagine it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, offended. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can see\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\nneat and clean and new?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why don\xe2\x80\x99t you like them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re--they\xe2\x80\x99re not--pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty!\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla sniffed. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble my head about getting\r\npretty dresses for you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable\r\ndresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do\r\nyou for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday\r\nschool. I\xe2\x80\x99ll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear\r\nthem. I should think you\xe2\x80\x99d be grateful to get most anything after those\r\nskimpy wincey things you\xe2\x80\x99ve been wearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _am_ grateful,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d be ever so much\r\ngratefuller if--if you\xe2\x80\x99d made just one of them with puffed sleeves.\r\nPuffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill,\r\nMarilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do without your thrill. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any material\r\nto waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things\r\nanyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and\r\nsensible all by myself,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Anne mournfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your\r\ncloset, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got\r\na quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Sunday school\r\ntomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.\r\n\r\nAnne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered disconsolately. \xe2\x80\x9cI prayed for one, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t much expect it\r\non that account. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose God would have time to bother about\r\na little orphan girl\xe2\x80\x99s dress. I knew I\xe2\x80\x99d just have to depend on\r\nMarilla for it. Well, fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of\r\nsnow-white muslin with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented Marilla from\r\ngoing to Sunday-school with Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you get into the right class. Now, mind you behave\r\nyourself properly. Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to\r\nshow you our pew. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a cent for collection. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stare at people\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t fidget. I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white\r\nsateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to\r\nthe charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle\r\nof her thin figure. Her hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the\r\nextreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed Anne, who\r\nhad permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers. The latter,\r\nhowever, were supplied before Anne reached the main road, for being\r\nconfronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred\r\nbuttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and liberally\r\ngarlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them. Whatever other people\r\nmight have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped\r\ngaily down the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink\r\nand yellow very proudly.\r\n\r\nWhen she had reached Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s house she found that lady gone.\r\nNothing daunted, Anne proceeded onward to the church alone. In the porch\r\nshe found a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in\r\nwhites and blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this\r\nstranger in their midst, with her extraordinary head adornment. Avonlea\r\nlittle girls had already heard queer stories about Anne. Mrs. Lynde said\r\nshe had an awful temper; Jerry Buote, the hired boy at Green Gables,\r\nsaid she talked all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers\r\nlike a crazy girl. They looked at her and whispered to each other behind\r\ntheir quarterlies. Nobody made any friendly advances, then or later\r\non when the opening exercises were over and Anne found herself in Miss\r\nRogerson\xe2\x80\x99s class.\r\n\r\nMiss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school\r\nclass for twenty years. Her method of teaching was to ask the printed\r\nquestions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the\r\nparticular little girl she thought ought to answer the question. She\r\nlooked very often at Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s drilling,\r\nanswered promptly; but it may be questioned if she understood very much\r\nabout either question or answer.\r\n\r\nShe did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable;\r\nevery other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that\r\nlife was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how did you like Sunday school?\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla wanted to know when Anne\r\ncame home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane,\r\nso Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it a bit. It was horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla rebukingly.\r\n\r\nAnne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might have been lonesome while I was away,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nnow about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs.\r\nLynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with\r\na lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the\r\nwindow while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully\r\nlong prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through\r\nif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the\r\nLake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts\r\nof splendid things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done anything of the sort. You should have listened\r\nto Mr. Bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking to me,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was talking to God\r\nand he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think\r\nhe thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white\r\nbirches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through\r\nthem, \xe2\x80\x98way, \xe2\x80\x98way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a\r\nbeautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you for it,\r\nGod,\xe2\x80\x99 two or three times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot out loud, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last\r\nand they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson\xe2\x80\x99s class.\r\nThere were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried\r\nto imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? It was\r\nas easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in\r\nthe east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had\r\nreally truly puffs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school.\r\nYou should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so\r\nmany. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were\r\nlots I wanted to ask her, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nshe was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a\r\nparaphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but I could\r\nrecite, \xe2\x80\x98The Dog at His Master\xe2\x80\x99s Grave\xe2\x80\x99 if she liked. That\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nThird Royal Reader. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a really truly religious piece of poetry,\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next\r\nSunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it\xe2\x80\x99s splendid. There are\r\ntwo lines in particular that just thrill me.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell\r\n   In Midian\xe2\x80\x99s evil day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what \xe2\x80\x98squadrons\xe2\x80\x99 means nor \xe2\x80\x98Midian,\xe2\x80\x99 either, but it sounds\r\n_so_ tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss\r\nRogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew.\r\nI sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third\r\nchapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a\r\nminister I\xe2\x80\x99d pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long,\r\ntoo. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nhe was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough imagination. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him very much. I just let\r\nmy thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but\r\nshe was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had\r\nsaid, especially about the minister\xe2\x80\x99s sermons and Mr. Bell\xe2\x80\x99s prayers,\r\nwere what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for\r\nyears, but had never given expression to. It almost seemed to her that\r\nthose secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible\r\nand accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of\r\nneglected humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. A Solemn Vow and Promise\r\n\r\n\r\n|IT was not until the next Friday that Marilla heard the story of the\r\nflower-wreathed hat. She came home from Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s and called Anne to\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, Mrs. Rachel says you went to church last Sunday with your hat\r\nrigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups. What on earth put you\r\nup to such a caper? A pretty-looking object you must have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. I know pink and yellow aren\xe2\x80\x99t becoming to me,\xe2\x80\x9d began Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecoming fiddlesticks! It was putting flowers on your hat at all,\r\nno matter what color they were, that was ridiculous. You are the most\r\naggravating child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why it\xe2\x80\x99s any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat\r\nthan on your dress,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of little girls there had\r\nbouquets pinned on their dresses. What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of\r\nthe abstract.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t answer me back like that, Anne. It was very silly of you to do\r\nsuch a thing. Never let me catch you at such a trick again. Mrs. Rachel\r\nsays she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come\r\nin all rigged out like that. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get near enough to tell you\r\nto take them off till it was too late. She says people talked about it\r\nsomething dreadful. Of course they would think I had no better sense\r\nthan to let you go decked out like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, tears welling into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nthought you\xe2\x80\x99d mind. The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty\r\nI thought they\xe2\x80\x99d look lovely on my hat. Lots of the little girls had\r\nartificial flowers on their hats. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a dreadful\r\ntrial to you. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d better send me back to the asylum. That would\r\nbe terrible; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could endure it; most likely I would go\r\ninto consumption; I\xe2\x80\x99m so thin as it is, you see. But that would be\r\nbetter than being a trial to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child\r\ncry. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to send you back to the asylum, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. All I want\r\nis that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself\r\nridiculous. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some news for you. Diana Barry\r\ncame home this afternoon. I\xe2\x80\x99m going up to see if I can borrow a skirt\r\npattern from Mrs. Barry, and if you like you can come with me and get\r\nacquainted with Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne rose to her feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on\r\nher cheeks; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99m frightened--now that it has come I\xe2\x80\x99m actually\r\nfrightened. What if she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me! It would be the most tragical\r\ndisappointment of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t get into a fluster. And I do wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use such long\r\nwords. It sounds so funny in a little girl. I guess Diana \xe2\x80\x98ll like you\r\nwell enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s her mother you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to reckon with. If she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike you it won\xe2\x80\x99t matter how much Diana does. If she has heard about\r\nyour outburst to Mrs. Lynde and going to church with buttercups round\r\nyour hat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she\xe2\x80\x99ll think of you. You must be polite and\r\nwell behaved, and don\xe2\x80\x99t make any of your startling speeches. For pity\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, if the child isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually trembling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne _was_ trembling. Her face was pale and tense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, you\xe2\x80\x99d be excited, too, if you were going to meet a little\r\ngirl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she hastened to get her hat.\r\n\r\nThey went over to Orchard Slope by the short cut across the brook and up\r\nthe firry hill grove. Mrs. Barry came to the kitchen door in answer to\r\nMarilla\xe2\x80\x99s knock. She was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a\r\nvery resolute mouth. She had the reputation of being very strict with\r\nher children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d she said cordially. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in. And this is the\r\nlittle girl you have adopted, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is Anne Shirley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpelled with an E,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Anne, who, tremulous and excited as she was,\r\nwas determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and\r\nsaid kindly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit, thank you\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne gravely. Then aside to Marilla in an audible whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything startling in that, was there, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the\r\ncallers entered. She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblack eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was\r\nher inheritance from her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my little girl Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Barry. \xe2\x80\x9cDiana, you might take\r\nAnne out into the garden and show her your flowers. It will be better\r\nfor you than straining your eyes over that book. She reads entirely\r\ntoo much--\xe2\x80\x9d this to Marilla as the little girls went out--\xe2\x80\x9cand I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprevent her, for her father aids and abets her. She\xe2\x80\x99s always poring over\r\na book. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad she has the prospect of a playmate--perhaps it will\r\ntake her more out-of-doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOutside in the garden, which was full of mellow sunset light streaming\r\nthrough the dark old firs to the west of it, stood Anne and Diana,\r\ngazing bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies.\r\n\r\nThe Barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have\r\ndelighted Anne\xe2\x80\x99s heart at any time less fraught with destiny. It was\r\nencircled by huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished\r\nflowers that loved the shade. Prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered\r\nwith clamshells, intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds\r\nbetween old-fashioned flowers ran riot. There were rosy bleeding-hearts\r\nand great splendid crimson peonies; white, fragrant narcissi and thorny,\r\nsweet Scotch roses; pink and blue and white columbines and lilac-tinted\r\nBouncing Bets; clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint; purple\r\nAdam-and-Eve, daffodils, and masses of sweet clover white with its\r\ndelicate, fragrant, feathery sprays; scarlet lightning that shot\r\nits fiery lances over prim white musk-flowers; a garden it was where\r\nsunshine lingered and bees hummed, and winds, beguiled into loitering,\r\npurred and rustled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne at last, clasping her hands and speaking almost\r\nin a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9coh, do you think you can like me a little--enough to be\r\nmy bosom friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana laughed. Diana always laughed before she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I guess so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to\r\nlive at Green Gables. It will be jolly to have somebody to play with.\r\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t any other girl who lives near enough to play with, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nno sisters big enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you swear to be my friend forever and ever?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Anne\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nDiana looked shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s dreadfully wicked to swear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said rebukingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not my kind of swearing. There are two kinds, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of but one kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere really is another. Oh, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t wicked at all. It just means\r\nvowing and promising solemnly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind doing that,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Diana, relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must join hands--so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ought to be over\r\nrunning water. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just imagine this path is running water. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrepeat the oath first. I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom\r\nfriend, Diana Barry, as long as the sun and moon shall endure. Now you\r\nsay it and put my name in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana repeated the \xe2\x80\x9coath\xe2\x80\x9d with a laugh fore and aft. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a queer girl, Anne. I heard before that you were queer. But I\r\nbelieve I\xe2\x80\x99m going to like you real well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Marilla and Anne went home Diana went with them as far as the log\r\nbridge. The two little girls walked with their arms about each other.\r\nAt the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Marilla as they went\r\nup through the garden of Green Gables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on\r\nMarilla\xe2\x80\x99s part. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99m the happiest girl on Prince Edward\r\nIsland this very moment. I assure you I\xe2\x80\x99ll say my prayers with a right\r\ngood-will tonight. Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr.\r\nWilliam Bell\xe2\x80\x99s birch grove tomorrow. Can I have those broken pieces of\r\nchina that are out in the woodshed? Diana\xe2\x80\x99s birthday is in February and\r\nmine is in March. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that is a very strange coincidence?\r\nDiana is going to lend me a book to read. She says it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly\r\nsplendid and tremendously exciting. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to show me a place back\r\nin the woods where rice lilies grow. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think Diana has got very\r\nsoulful eyes? I wish I had soulful eyes. Diana is going to teach me to\r\nsing a song called \xe2\x80\x98Nelly in the Hazel Dell.\xe2\x80\x99 She\xe2\x80\x99s going to give me a\r\npicture to put up in my room; it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly beautiful picture, she\r\nsays--a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent\r\ngave it to her. I wish I had something to give Diana. I\xe2\x80\x99m an inch taller\r\nthan Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she\xe2\x80\x99d like to be\r\nthin because it\xe2\x80\x99s so much more graceful, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she only said\r\nit to soothe my feelings. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to the shore some day to gather\r\nshells. We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the\r\nDryad\xe2\x80\x99s Bubble. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a perfectly elegant name? I read a story\r\nonce about a spring called that. A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all I hope is you won\xe2\x80\x99t talk Diana to death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nremember this in all your planning, Anne. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to play all\r\nthe time nor most of it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have your work to do and it\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\nbe done first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow. He\r\nhad just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody, and he sheepishly\r\nproduced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to Anne, with a\r\ndeprecatory look at Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll ruin her teeth and stomach. There,\r\nthere, child, don\xe2\x80\x99t look so dismal. You can eat those, since Matthew\r\nhas gone and got them. He\xe2\x80\x99d better have brought you peppermints. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwholesomer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t sicken yourself eating all them at once now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, indeed, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just eat one\r\ntonight, Marilla. And I can give Diana half of them, can\xe2\x80\x99t I? The\r\nother half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelightful to think I have something to give her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say it for the child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla when Anne had gone to\r\nher gable, \xe2\x80\x9cshe isn\xe2\x80\x99t stingy. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad, for of all faults I detest\r\nstinginess in a child. Dear me, it\xe2\x80\x99s only three weeks since she came,\r\nand it seems as if she\xe2\x80\x99d been here always. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the place\r\nwithout her. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t be looking I told-you-so, Matthew. That\xe2\x80\x99s bad\r\nenough in a woman, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be endured in a man. I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly\r\nwilling to own up that I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I consented to keep the child and that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m getting fond of her, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you rub it in, Matthew Cuthbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. The Delights of Anticipation\r\n\r\n\r\n|IT\xe2\x80\x99S time Anne was in to do her sewing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, glancing at the\r\nclock and then out into the yellow August afternoon where everything\r\ndrowsed in the heat. \xe2\x80\x9cShe stayed playing with Diana more than half an\r\nhour more \xe2\x80\x98n I gave her leave to; and now she\xe2\x80\x99s perched out there on\r\nthe woodpile talking to Matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she knows\r\nperfectly well she ought to be at her work. And of course he\xe2\x80\x99s listening\r\nto her like a perfect ninny. I never saw such an infatuated man.\r\nThe more she talks and the odder the things she says, the more he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelighted evidently. Anne Shirley, you come right in here this minute,\r\ndo you hear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA series of staccato taps on the west window brought Anne flying in from\r\nthe yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided hair\r\nstreaming behind her in a torrent of brightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed breathlessly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a\r\nSunday-school picnic next week--in Mr. Harmon Andrews\xe2\x80\x99s field, right\r\nnear the lake of Shining Waters. And Mrs. Superintendent Bell and Mrs.\r\nRachel Lynde are going to make ice cream--think of it, Marilla--_ice\r\ncream!_ And, oh, Marilla, can I go to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at the clock, if you please, Anne. What time did I tell you\r\nto come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock--but isn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid about the picnic, Marilla? Please\r\ncan I go? Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to a picnic--I\xe2\x80\x99ve dreamed of picnics, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I told you to come at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a quarter to three.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know why you didn\xe2\x80\x99t obey me, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I meant to, Marilla, as much as could be. But you have no idea\r\nhow fascinating Idlewild is. And then, of course, I had to tell Matthew\r\nabout the picnic. Matthew is such a sympathetic listener. Please can I\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to learn to resist the fascination of\r\nIdle-whatever-you-call-it. When I tell you to come in at a certain time\r\nI mean that time and not half an hour later. And you needn\xe2\x80\x99t stop to\r\ndiscourse with sympathetic listeners on your way, either. As for the\r\npicnic, of course you can go. You\xe2\x80\x99re a Sunday-school scholar, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot likely I\xe2\x80\x99d refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are\r\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--but,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cDiana says that everybody must take a basket\r\nof things to eat. I can\xe2\x80\x99t cook, as you know, Marilla, and--and--I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much, but I\xe2\x80\x99d feel\r\nterribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket. It\xe2\x80\x99s been preying\r\non my mind ever since Diana told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it needn\xe2\x80\x99t prey any longer. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bake you a basket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you dear good Marilla. Oh, you are so kind to me. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so much\r\nobliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGetting through with her \xe2\x80\x9cohs\xe2\x80\x9d Anne cast herself into Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s arms and\r\nrapturously kissed her sallow cheek. It was the first time in her whole\r\nlife that childish lips had voluntarily touched Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s face. Again\r\nthat sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her. She was\r\nsecretly vastly pleased at Anne\xe2\x80\x99s impulsive caress, which was probably\r\nthe reason why she said brusquely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner see you\r\ndoing strictly as you\xe2\x80\x99re told. As for cooking, I mean to begin giving\r\nyou lessons in that some of these days. But you\xe2\x80\x99re so featherbrained,\r\nAnne, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting to see if you\xe2\x80\x99d sober down a little and learn\r\nto be steady before I begin. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep your wits about you in\r\ncooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove\r\nall over creation. Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done\r\nbefore teatime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do _not_ like patchwork,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne dolefully, hunting out her\r\nworkbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white\r\ndiamonds with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI think some kinds of sewing would be nice; but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no scope for imagination in patchwork. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one little seam\r\nafter another and you never seem to be getting anywhere. But of course\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any\r\nother place with nothing to do but play. I wish time went as quick\r\nsewing patches as it does when I\xe2\x80\x99m playing with Diana, though. Oh, we\r\ndo have such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the\r\nimagination, but I\xe2\x80\x99m well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in\r\nevery other way. You know that little piece of land across the brook\r\nthat runs up between our farm and Mr. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s. It belongs to Mr. William\r\nBell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch\r\ntrees--the most romantic spot, Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse\r\nthere. We call it Idlewild. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a poetical name? I assure you it\r\ntook me some time to think it out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night\r\nbefore I invented it. Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came\r\nlike an inspiration. Diana was _enraptured_ when she heard it. We have got\r\nour house fixed up elegantly. You must come and see it, Marilla--won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou? We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and\r\nboards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all our dishes on\r\nthem. Of course, they\xe2\x80\x99re all broken but it\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest thing in the\r\nworld to imagine that they are whole. There\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of a plate with a\r\nspray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep\r\nit in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass\r\nis as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the woods behind their\r\nchicken house. It\xe2\x80\x99s all full of rainbows--just little young rainbows\r\nthat haven\xe2\x80\x99t grown big yet--and Diana\xe2\x80\x99s mother told her it was broken\r\noff a hanging lamp they once had. But it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to imagine the fairies\r\nlost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass.\r\nMatthew is going to make us a table. Oh, we have named that little round\r\npool over in Mr. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s field Willowmere. I got that name out of the\r\nbook Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla. The heroine\r\nhad five lovers. I\xe2\x80\x99d be satisfied with one, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? She was very\r\nhandsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as\r\neasy as anything. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to be able to faint, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Marilla?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s so romantic. But I\xe2\x80\x99m really very healthy for all I\xe2\x80\x99m so thin. I\r\nbelieve I\xe2\x80\x99m getting fatter, though. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I am? I look at my\r\nelbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming.\r\nDiana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to\r\nwear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened\r\nto prevent me from getting to the picnic. I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d live through it,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m certain it would be a lifelong sorrow. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if\r\nI got to a hundred picnics in after years; they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make up for\r\nmissing this one. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have boats on the Lake of Shining\r\nWaters--and ice cream, as I told you. I have never tasted ice cream.\r\nDiana tried to explain what it was like, but I guess ice cream is one of\r\nthose things that are beyond imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, just for curiosity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, see if you can hold your\r\ntongue for the same length of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne held her tongue as desired. But for the rest of the week she talked\r\npicnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic. On Saturday it rained and\r\nshe worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep\r\non raining until and over Wednesday that Marilla made her sew an extra\r\npatchwork square by way of steadying her nerves.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday Anne confided to Marilla on the way home from church that she\r\ngrew actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced\r\nthe picnic from the pulpit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a thrill as went up and down my back, Marilla! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\never really believed until then that there was honestly going to be\r\na picnic. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help fearing I\xe2\x80\x99d only imagined it. But when a\r\nminister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou set your heart too much on things, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, with a\r\nsigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a great many disappointments in store for\r\nyou through life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mayn\xe2\x80\x99t get the things themselves; but nothing can\r\nprevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them. Mrs.\r\nLynde says, \xe2\x80\x98Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x99 But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to\r\nbe disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual. Marilla\r\nalways wore her amethyst brooch to church. She would have thought it\r\nrather sacrilegious to leave it off--as bad as forgetting her Bible or\r\nher collection dime. That amethyst brooch was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s most treasured\r\npossession. A seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn\r\nhad bequeathed it to Marilla. It was an old-fashioned oval, containing\r\na braid of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hair, surrounded by a border of very fine\r\namethysts. Marilla knew too little about precious stones to realize how\r\nfine the amethysts actually were; but she thought them very beautiful\r\nand was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her\r\nthroat, above her good brown satin dress, even although she could not\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\nAnne had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that\r\nbrooch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly elegant brooch. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you\r\ncan pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I know. I think amethysts are just sweet. They are what I used\r\nto think diamonds were like. Long ago, before I had ever seen a diamond,\r\nI read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like. I\r\nthought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones. When I saw a\r\nreal diamond in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of\r\ncourse, it was very lovely but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my idea of a diamond. Will you\r\nlet me hold the brooch for one minute, Marilla? Do you think amethysts\r\ncan be the souls of good violets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s Confession\r\n\r\n\r\n|ON the Monday evening before the picnic Marilla came down from her room\r\nwith a troubled face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the\r\nspotless table and singing, \xe2\x80\x9cNelly of the Hazel Dell\xe2\x80\x9d with a vigor and\r\nexpression that did credit to Diana\xe2\x80\x99s teaching, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you see anything\r\nof my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came\r\nhome from church yesterday evening, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAnne, a little slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was passing your door when I saw it on the\r\ncushion, so I went in to look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you touch it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-e-e-s,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cI took it up and I pinned it on my breast\r\njust to see how it would look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had no business to do anything of the sort. It\xe2\x80\x99s very wrong in a\r\nlittle girl to meddle. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone into my room in the first\r\nplace and you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have touched a brooch that didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to you\r\nin the second. Where did you put it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t it on a minute. Truly, I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think about its being wrong to\r\ngo in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\ndo it again. That\xe2\x80\x99s one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty\r\nthing twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t put it back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cThat brooch isn\xe2\x80\x99t anywhere on\r\nthe bureau. You\xe2\x80\x99ve taken it out or something, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did put it back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne quickly--pertly, Marilla thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in\r\nthe china tray. But I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly certain I put it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and have another look,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, determining to be just.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you put that brooch back it\xe2\x80\x99s there still. If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99ll know you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the\r\nbureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly\r\nbe. It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last\r\nperson to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth\r\nat once. Did you take it out and lose it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s angry gaze\r\nsquarely. \xe2\x80\x9cI never took the brooch out of your room and that is the\r\ntruth, if I was to be led to the block for it--although I\xe2\x80\x99m not very\r\ncertain what a block is. So there, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cso there\xe2\x80\x9d was only intended to emphasize her assertion, but\r\nMarilla took it as a display of defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow you are. There now, don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything more unless you are prepared\r\nto tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are\r\nready to confess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill I take the peas with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne meekly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Anne had gone Marilla went about her evening tasks in a very\r\ndisturbed state of mind. She was worried about her valuable brooch. What\r\nif Anne had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken\r\nit, when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face,\r\ntoo!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sooner have had happen,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Marilla,\r\nas she nervously shelled the peas. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose she meant\r\nto steal it or anything like that. She\xe2\x80\x99s just taken it to play with\r\nor help along that imagination of hers. She must have taken it, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclear, for there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a soul in that room since she was in it, by\r\nher own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for\r\nfear she\xe2\x80\x99ll be punished. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dreadful thing to think she tells\r\nfalsehoods. It\xe2\x80\x99s a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can\xe2\x80\x99t trust.\r\nSlyness and untruthfulness--that\xe2\x80\x99s what she has displayed. I declare I\r\nfeel worse about that than about the brooch. If she\xe2\x80\x99d only have told the\r\ntruth about it I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla went to her room at intervals all through the evening and\r\nsearched for the brooch, without finding it. A bedtime visit to the\r\neast gable produced no result. Anne persisted in denying that she knew\r\nanything about the brooch but Marilla was only the more firmly convinced\r\nthat she did.\r\n\r\nShe told Matthew the story the next morning. Matthew was confounded and\r\npuzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but he had to admit\r\nthat circumstances were against her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fell down behind the bureau?\xe2\x80\x9d was the only\r\nsuggestion he could offer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve moved the bureau and I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken out the drawers and I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked\r\nin every crack and cranny\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s positive answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe brooch\r\nis gone and that child has taken it and lied about it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the plain,\r\nugly truth, Matthew Cuthbert, and we might as well look it in the face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, what are you going to do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d Matthew asked forlornly,\r\nfeeling secretly thankful that Marilla and not he had to deal with the\r\nsituation. He felt no desire to put his oar in this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in her room until she confesses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla grimly,\r\nremembering the success of this method in the former case. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee. Perhaps we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to find the brooch if she\xe2\x80\x99ll only tell\r\nwhere she took it; but in any case she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be severely punished,\r\nMatthew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to punish her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, reaching for his\r\nhat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to do with it, remember. You warned me off yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla felt deserted by everyone. She could not even go to Mrs. Lynde\r\nfor advice. She went up to the east gable with a very serious face and\r\nleft it with a face more serious still. Anne steadfastly refused to\r\nconfess. She persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch.\r\nThe child had evidently been crying and Marilla felt a pang of pity\r\nwhich she sternly repressed. By night she was, as she expressed it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbeat out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in this room until you confess, Anne. You can make up your\r\nmind to that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the picnic is tomorrow, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t keep me\r\nfrom going to that, will you? You\xe2\x80\x99ll just let me out for the afternoon,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you? Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here as long as you like _afterwards_\r\ncheerfully. But I _must_ go to the picnic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you\xe2\x80\x99ve confessed,\r\nAnne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Anne.\r\n\r\nBut Marilla had gone out and shut the door.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to\r\norder for the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies\r\nin the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless\r\nwinds at every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms\r\nlike spirits of benediction. The birches in the hollow waved joyful\r\nhands as if watching for Anne\xe2\x80\x99s usual morning greeting from the east\r\ngable. But Anne was not at her window. When Marilla took her breakfast\r\nup to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed, pale and\r\nresolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to confess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla laid down her tray. Once again her method had succeeded;\r\nbut her success was very bitter to her. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me hear what you have to\r\nsay then, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the amethyst brooch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, as if repeating a lesson she\r\nhad learned. \xe2\x80\x9cI took it just as you said. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to take it when\r\nI went in. But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on my\r\nbreast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how\r\nperfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was\r\nthe Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. It would be so much easier to imagine I\r\nwas the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and\r\nI make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to\r\namethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before\r\nyou came home. I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the\r\ntime. When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters\r\nI took the brooch off to have another look at it. Oh, how it did shine\r\nin the sunlight! And then, when I was leaning over the bridge, it\r\njust slipped through my fingers--so--and went down--down--down, all\r\npurply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining\r\nWaters. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the best I can do at confessing, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla felt hot anger surge up into her heart again. This child had\r\ntaken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly\r\nreciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or\r\nrepentance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, this is terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trying to speak calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the\r\nvery wickedest girl I ever heard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose I am,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Anne tranquilly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\r\nbe punished. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be your duty to punish me, Marilla. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you please\r\nget it over right off because I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go to the picnic with nothing\r\non my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPicnic, indeed! You\xe2\x80\x99ll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley. That shall\r\nbe your punishment. And it isn\xe2\x80\x99t half severe enough either for what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot go to the picnic!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne sprang to her feet and clutched Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you _promised_ me I might! Oh, Marilla, I must go to the\r\npicnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that.\r\nOh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice\r\ncream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice\r\ncream again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla disengaged Anne\xe2\x80\x99s clinging hands stonily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t plead, Anne. You are not going to the picnic and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinal. No, not a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne realized that Marilla was not to be moved. She clasped her hands\r\ntogether, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face\r\ndownward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of\r\ndisappointment and despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the land\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Marilla, hastening from the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve the child is crazy. No child in her senses would behave as she\r\ndoes. If she isn\xe2\x80\x99t she\xe2\x80\x99s utterly bad. Oh dear, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid Rachel was\r\nright from the first. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve put my hand to the plow and I won\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a dismal morning. Marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the\r\nporch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to\r\ndo. Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it--but Marilla did. Then\r\nshe went out and raked the yard.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Anne. A\r\ntear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down to your dinner, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any dinner, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, sobbingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neat anything. My heart is broken. You\xe2\x80\x99ll feel remorse of conscience\r\nsomeday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you. Remember\r\nwhen the time comes that I forgive you. But please don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to eat\r\nanything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are\r\nso unromantic when one is in affliction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale\r\nof woe to Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful\r\nsympathy with Anne, was a miserable man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told stories\r\nabout it,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic\r\npork and greens as if he, like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to\r\ncrises of feeling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she\xe2\x80\x99s such a little thing--such an interesting\r\nlittle thing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty rough not to let her go to the\r\npicnic when she\xe2\x80\x99s so set on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Cuthbert, I\xe2\x80\x99m amazed at you. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve let her off entirely\r\ntoo easy. And she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to realize how wicked she\xe2\x80\x99s been at\r\nall--that\xe2\x80\x99s what worries me most. If she\xe2\x80\x99d really felt sorry it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe so bad. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to realize it, neither; you\xe2\x80\x99re making\r\nexcuses for her all the time to yourself--I can see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, she\xe2\x80\x99s such a little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d feebly reiterated Matthew. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthere should be allowances made, Marilla. You know she\xe2\x80\x99s never had any\r\nbringing up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s having it now\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Marilla.\r\n\r\nThe retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him. That dinner was\r\na very dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote,\r\nthe hired boy, and Marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nWhen her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed\r\nMarilla remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black\r\nlace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning\r\nfrom the Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Aid.\r\n\r\nShe would go and mend it. The shawl was in a box in her trunk. As\r\nMarilla lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that\r\nclustered thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the\r\nshawl--something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light.\r\nMarilla snatched at it with a gasp. It was the amethyst brooch, hanging\r\nto a thread of the lace by its catch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear life and heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla blankly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does this mean?\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of\r\nBarry\xe2\x80\x99s pond. Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost\r\nit? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched. I remember now that\r\nwhen I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a\r\nminute. I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Anne had cried\r\nherself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just found my brooch\r\nhanging to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that rigmarole\r\nyou told me this morning meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you said you\xe2\x80\x99d keep me here until I confessed,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Anne\r\nwearily, \xe2\x80\x9cand so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the\r\npicnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and\r\nmade it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget it. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me go to the picnic after all,\r\nso all my trouble was wasted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, you do beat all! But I was wrong--I see that now. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave doubted your word when I\xe2\x80\x99d never known you to tell a story.\r\nOf course, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right for you to confess to a thing you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndone--it was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nforgive me, Anne, I\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive you and we\xe2\x80\x99ll start square again. And now\r\nget yourself ready for the picnic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne flew up like a rocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it too late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s only two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. They won\xe2\x80\x99t be more than well gathered yet\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99ll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your\r\nhair and put on your gingham. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fill a basket for you. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty\r\nof stuff baked in the house. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel\r\nand drive you down to the picnic ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Anne, flying to the washstand. \xe2\x80\x9cFive minutes\r\nago I was so miserable I was wishing I\xe2\x80\x99d never been born and now I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change places with an angel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Anne returned to\r\nGreen Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a perfectly scrumptious time. Scrumptious is a\r\nnew word I learned today. I heard Mary Alice Bell use it. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it very\r\nexpressive? Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr.\r\nHarmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters--six\r\nof us at a time. And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard. She was leaning\r\nout to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn\xe2\x80\x99t caught her by her\r\nsash just in the nick of time she\xe2\x80\x99d fallen in and prob\xe2\x80\x99ly been drowned.\r\nI wish it had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to\r\nhave been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And\r\nwe had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. Marilla,\r\nI assure you it was sublime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening Marilla told the whole story to Matthew over her stocking\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m willing to own up that I made a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded candidly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lesson. I have to laugh when I think of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98confession,\xe2\x80\x99 although I suppose I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for it really was a\r\nfalsehood. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem as bad as the other would have been,\r\nsomehow, and anyhow I\xe2\x80\x99m responsible for it. That child is hard to\r\nunderstand in some respects. But I believe she\xe2\x80\x99ll turn out all right\r\nyet. And there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. A Tempest in the School Teapot\r\n\r\n\r\n|WHAT a splendid day!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, drawing a long breath. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it good\r\njust to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t born\r\nyet for missing it. They may have good days, of course, but they can\r\nnever have this one. And it\xe2\x80\x99s splendider still to have such a lovely way\r\nto go to school by, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty\r\nand hot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana practically, peeping into her dinner basket and\r\nmentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts\r\nreposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl\r\nwould have.\r\n\r\nThe little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and\r\nto eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s best chum would have forever and ever branded as \xe2\x80\x9cawful mean\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ngirl who did it. And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls\r\nyou just got enough to tantalize you.\r\n\r\nThe way Anne and Diana went to school _was_ a pretty one. Anne thought\r\nthose walks to and from school with Diana couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be improved upon\r\neven by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so\r\nunromantic; but to go by Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and\r\nthe Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was.\r\n\r\nLover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched\r\nfar up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by\r\nwhich the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home\r\nin winter. Anne had named it Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane before she had been a month at\r\nGreen Gables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that lovers ever really walk there,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained to Marilla,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nLover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a very pretty\r\nname, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? So romantic! We can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the lovers into it,\r\nyou know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without\r\npeople calling you crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane as far\r\nas the brook. Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on\r\nup the lane under the leafy arch of maples--\xe2\x80\x9cmaples are such sociable\r\ntrees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re always rustling and whispering to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x9d--until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane\r\nand walked through Mr. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s back field and past Willowmere. Beyond\r\nWillowmere came Violet Vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr.\r\nAndrew Bell\xe2\x80\x99s big woods. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there are no violets there now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Anne told Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Diana says there are millions of them in spring.\r\nOh, Marilla, can\xe2\x80\x99t you just imagine you see them? It actually takes away\r\nmy breath. I named it Violet Vale. Diana says she never saw the beat\r\nof me for hitting on fancy names for places. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to be clever at\r\nsomething, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But Diana named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so\r\nI let her; but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I could have found something more poetical than\r\nplain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch\r\nPath is one of the prettiest places in the world, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was. Other people besides Anne thought so when they stumbled on it.\r\nIt was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill\r\nstraight through Mr. Bell\xe2\x80\x99s woods, where the light came down sifted\r\nthrough so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart\r\nof a diamond. It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches,\r\nwhite stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild\r\nlilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly\r\nalong it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and\r\nmusic of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees\r\noverhead. Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road\r\nif you were quiet--which, with Anne and Diana, happened about once in\r\na blue moon. Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and\r\nthen it was just up the spruce hill to the school.\r\n\r\nThe Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and\r\nwide in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial\r\nold-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their\r\nlids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school\r\nchildren. The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was\r\na dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of\r\nmilk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour.\r\n\r\nMarilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September\r\nwith many secret misgivings. Anne was such an odd girl. How would she\r\nget on with the other children? And how on earth would she ever manage\r\nto hold her tongue during school hours?\r\n\r\nThings went better than Marilla feared, however. Anne came home that\r\nevening in high spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to like school here,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nmuch of the master, through. He\xe2\x80\x99s all the time curling his mustache\r\nand making eyes at Prissy Andrews. Prissy is grown up, you know. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsixteen and she\xe2\x80\x99s studying for the entrance examination into Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nAcademy at Charlottetown next year. Tillie Boulter says the master is\r\n_dead gone_ on her. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair\r\nand she does it up so elegantly. She sits in the long seat at the back\r\nand he sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her lessons, he\r\nsays. But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate\r\nand when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and\r\nRuby Gillis says she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it had anything to do with the\r\nlesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, don\xe2\x80\x99t let me hear you talking about your teacher in that\r\nway again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t go to school to criticize\r\nthe master. I guess he can teach _you_ something, and it\xe2\x80\x99s your business\r\nto learn. And I want you to understand right off that you are not to\r\ncome home telling tales about him. That is something I won\xe2\x80\x99t encourage.\r\nI hope you were a good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne comfortably. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so hard as you might\r\nimagine, either. I sit with Diana. Our seat is right by the window and\r\nwe can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of nice\r\ngirls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like\r\nDiana best and always will. I _adore_ Diana. I\xe2\x80\x99m dreadfully far behind the\r\nothers. They\xe2\x80\x99re all in the fifth book and I\xe2\x80\x99m only in the fourth. I feel\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a disgrace. But there\xe2\x80\x99s not one of them has such an\r\nimagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and\r\ngeography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my\r\nspelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could\r\nsee it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have\r\nbeen politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and\r\nSophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with \xe2\x80\x98May I see you home?\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nit. I\xe2\x80\x99m to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear\r\nher bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads\r\noff the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh,\r\nMarilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she\r\nheard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose.\r\nMarilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really\r\na pretty nose? I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour nose is well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla shortly. Secretly she thought\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of\r\ntelling her so.\r\n\r\nThat was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this\r\ncrisp September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the\r\nBirch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nvisiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came\r\nhome Saturday night. He\xe2\x80\x99s _aw\xe2\x80\x99fly_ handsome, Anne. And he teases the\r\ngirls something terrible. He just torments our lives out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana\xe2\x80\x99s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented\r\nout than not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert Blythe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t his name that\xe2\x80\x99s written up on the\r\nporch wall with Julia Bell\xe2\x80\x99s and a big \xe2\x80\x98Take Notice\xe2\x80\x99 over them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, tossing her head, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like Julia\r\nBell so very much. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say he studied the multiplication\r\ntable by her freckles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak about freckles to me,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndelicate when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got so many. But I do think that writing take-notices\r\nup on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. I should\r\njust like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy\xe2\x80\x99s. Not, of\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to add, \xe2\x80\x9cthat anybody would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sighed. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her name written up. But it was a little\r\nhumiliating to know that there was no danger of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played\r\nsuch havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured\r\non the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only meant as\r\na joke. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you be too sure your name won\xe2\x80\x99t ever be written up.\r\nCharlie Sloane is _dead gone_ on you. He told his mother--his _mother_,\r\nmind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than\r\nbeing good looking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, feminine to the core. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather be pretty\r\nthan clever. And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear a boy with goggle\r\neyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his I\xe2\x80\x99d never _get_ over it, Diana\r\nBarry. But it _is_ nice to keep head of your class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have Gilbert in your class after this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nused to being head of his class, I can tell you. He\xe2\x80\x99s only in the fourth\r\nbook although he\xe2\x80\x99s nearly fourteen. Four years ago his father was sick\r\nand had to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him.\r\nThey were there three years and Gil didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to school hardly any\r\nuntil they came back. You won\xe2\x80\x99t find it so easy to keep head after this,\r\nAnne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really feel proud of keeping\r\nhead of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got up yesterday\r\nspelling \xe2\x80\x98ebullition.\xe2\x80\x99 Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she peeped\r\nin her book. Mr. Phillips didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her--he was looking at Prissy\r\nAndrews--but I did. I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she\r\ngot as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose Pye girls are cheats all round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana indignantly, as they\r\nclimbed the fence of the main road. \xe2\x80\x9cGertie Pye actually went and put\r\nher milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLatin, Diana whispered to Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Gilbert Blythe sitting right\r\nacross the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him and see if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink he\xe2\x80\x99s handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said\r\nGilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid\r\nof Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He\r\nwas a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth\r\ntwisted into a teasing smile. Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take\r\na sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek,\r\nbelieving that her hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at\r\nher and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry. Gilbert\r\nhad whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the\r\nsoberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at\r\nAnne and winked with inexpressible drollery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your Gilbert Blythe _is_ handsome,\xe2\x80\x9d confided Anne to Diana,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I think he\xe2\x80\x99s very bold. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t good manners to wink at a strange\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to\r\nPrissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as\r\nthey pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their\r\nslates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.\r\nGilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing\r\nutterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only\r\nto the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in\r\nAvonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes\r\nfixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west\r\nwindow afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and\r\nseeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.\r\n\r\nGilbert Blythe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to putting himself out to make a girl look\r\nat him and meeting with failure. She _should_ look at him, that red-haired\r\nShirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.\r\n\r\nGilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s long red\r\nbraid, held it out at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length and said in a piercing whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarrots! Carrots!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Anne looked at him with a vengeance!\r\n\r\nShe did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies\r\nfallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert\r\nfrom eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, hateful boy!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then--thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s head and\r\ncracked it--slate not head--clear across.\r\n\r\nAvonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable\r\none. Everybody said \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x9d in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby\r\nGillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy\r\nSloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared\r\nopen-mouthed at the tableau.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, what does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said angrily. Anne returned no\r\nanswer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell\r\nbefore the whole school that she had been called \xe2\x80\x9ccarrots.\xe2\x80\x9d Gilbert it\r\nwas who spoke up stoutly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such\r\na vindictive spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of\r\nbeing a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts\r\nof small imperfect mortals. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne, go and stand on the platform in front\r\nof the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under\r\nwhich her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white,\r\nset face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the\r\nblackboard above her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnn Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control\r\nher temper,\xe2\x80\x9d and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,\r\nwho couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read writing, should understand it.\r\n\r\nAnne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.\r\nShe did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart\r\nfor that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With\r\nresentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s indignant nods and Josie Pye\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmalicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.\r\nShe would _never_ look at him again! She would never speak to him!!\r\n\r\nWhen school was dismissed Anne marched out with her red head held high.\r\nGilbert Blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered\r\ncontritely. \xe2\x80\x9cHonest I am. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be mad for keeps, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nhow could you, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Diana as they went down the road half\r\nreproachfully, half admiringly. Diana felt that _she_ could never have\r\nresisted Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s plea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr.\r\nPhillips spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered into my\r\nsoul, Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea what Anne meant but she understood it was\r\nsomething terrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t mind Gilbert making fun of your hair,\xe2\x80\x9d she said soothingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he makes fun of all the girls. He laughs at mine because it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso black. He\xe2\x80\x99s called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him\r\napologize for anything before, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal of difference between being called a crow and\r\nbeing called carrots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne with dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cGilbert Blythe has hurt\r\nmy feelings _excruciatingly_, Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is possible the matter might have blown over without more\r\nexcruciation if nothing else had happened. But when things begin to\r\nhappen they are apt to keep on.\r\n\r\nAvonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell\xe2\x80\x99s spruce\r\ngrove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they\r\ncould keep an eye on Eben Wright\xe2\x80\x99s house, where the master boarded. When\r\nthey saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse;\r\nbut the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright\xe2\x80\x99s lane\r\nthey were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three\r\nminutes too late.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic\r\nfits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should\r\nexpect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone\r\nwho came in late would be punished.\r\n\r\nAll the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell\xe2\x80\x99s spruce grove as\r\nusual, fully intending to stay only long enough to \xe2\x80\x9cpick a chew.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nspruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they\r\npicked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that\r\nrecalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting\r\nfrom the top of a patriarchal old spruce \xe2\x80\x9cMaster\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the\r\nschoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to\r\nwriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not\r\nbeen picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the\r\ngrove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a\r\nwreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity\r\nof the shadowy places, was latest of all. Anne could run like a deer,\r\nhowever; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys\r\nat the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr.\r\nPhillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s brief reforming energy was over; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the\r\nbother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something\r\nto save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it\r\nin Anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a\r\nforgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a\r\nparticularly rakish and disheveled appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys\xe2\x80\x99 company we\r\nshall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sarcastically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other boys snickered. Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the\r\nwreath from Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hair and squeezed her hand. Anne stared at the master\r\nas if turned to stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear what I said, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Mr. Phillips sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne slowly \xe2\x80\x9cbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you really meant it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I did\xe2\x80\x9d--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the\r\nchildren, and Anne especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. \xe2\x80\x9cObey me at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey. Then, realizing\r\nthat there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the\r\naisle, sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms\r\non the desk. Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down,\r\ntold the others going home from school that she\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9cacksually never seen\r\nanything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Anne, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be\r\nsingled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it\r\nwas worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should\r\nbe Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly\r\nunbearable. Anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of\r\nno use to try. Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nAt first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.\r\nBut as Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if\r\nhis whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned\r\nto their own tasks and Anne was forgotten. When Mr. Phillips called the\r\nhistory class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and\r\nMr. Phillips, who had been writing some verses \xe2\x80\x9cTo Priscilla\xe2\x80\x9d before he\r\ncalled the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never\r\nmissed her. Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk\r\na little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nslipped it under the curve of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s arm. Whereupon Anne arose, took the\r\npink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the\r\nfloor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position\r\nwithout deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert.\r\n\r\nWhen school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out\r\neverything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and\r\narithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you taking all those things home for, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d Diana wanted to\r\nknow, as soon as they were out on the road. She had not dared to ask the\r\nquestion before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not coming back to school any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. Diana gasped and\r\nstared at Anne to see if she meant it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Marilla let you stay home?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll _never_ go to school to that man\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne!\xe2\x80\x9d Diana looked as if she were ready to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cI do think you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmean. What shall I do? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid\r\nGertie Pye--I know he will because she is sitting alone. Do come back,\r\nAnne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do almost anything in the world for you, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne sadly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t do this, so please don\xe2\x80\x99t ask it. You harrow up my very soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think of all the fun you will miss,\xe2\x80\x9d mourned Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going\r\nto build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be playing\r\nball next week and you\xe2\x80\x99ve never played ball, Anne. It\xe2\x80\x99s tremendously\r\nexciting. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to learn a new song--Jane Andrews is\r\npracticing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy\r\nbook next week and we\xe2\x80\x99re all going to read it out loud, chapter about,\r\ndown by the brook. And you know you are so fond of reading out loud,\r\nAnne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing moved Anne in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go\r\nto school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t nonsense at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn,\r\nreproachful eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you understand, Marilla? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been insulted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsulted fiddlesticks! You\xe2\x80\x99ll go to school tomorrow as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne shook her head gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going back, Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlearn my lessons at home and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be as good as I can be and hold my\r\ntongue all the time if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible at all. But I will not go back to\r\nschool, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking\r\nout of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s small face. She understood that she would have trouble in\r\novercoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no use reasoning with Anne now. She\xe2\x80\x99s too worked up and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nan idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can\r\nmake out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a\r\nrather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just talk\r\nit over with Rachel. She\xe2\x80\x99s sent ten children to school and she ought to\r\nknow something about it. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have heard the whole story, too, by this\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you know what I\xe2\x80\x99ve come about,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little\r\nshamefacedly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Anne\xe2\x80\x99s fuss in school, I reckon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTillie Boulter was\r\nin on her way home from school and told me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cShe declares she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nexpecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were\r\ngoing too smooth to last. She\xe2\x80\x99s so high strung. What would you advise,\r\nRachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked my advice, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lynde\r\namiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d just\r\nhumor her a little at first, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d do. It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief that\r\nMr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do to say so to the\r\nchildren, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday\r\nfor giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who\r\nwere late should have been punished as well as Anne, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. And I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne\xe2\x80\x99s part\r\nright through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular\r\namong them, somehow. I never thought she\xe2\x80\x99d take with them so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you really think I\xe2\x80\x99d better let her stay home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That is I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say school to her again until she said it\r\nherself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she\xe2\x80\x99ll cool off in a week or so and\r\nbe ready enough to go back of her own accord, that\xe2\x80\x99s what, while, if\r\nyou were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the\r\nbetter, in my opinion. She won\xe2\x80\x99t miss much by not going to school, as\r\nfar as _that_ goes. Mr. Phillips isn\xe2\x80\x99t any good at all as a teacher. The\r\norder he keeps is scandalous, that\xe2\x80\x99s what, and he neglects the young\r\nfry and puts all his time on those big scholars he\xe2\x80\x99s getting ready for\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99d never have got the school for another year if his uncle\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two\r\naround by the nose, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. I declare, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what education\r\nin this Island is coming to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the\r\nhead of the educational system of the Province things would be much\r\nbetter managed.\r\n\r\nMarilla took Mrs. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s advice and not another word was said to Anne\r\nabout going back to school. She learned her lessons at home, did her\r\nchores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights;\r\nbut when she met Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him in Sunday\r\nschool she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by\r\nhis evident desire to appease her. Even Diana\xe2\x80\x99s efforts as a peacemaker\r\nwere of no avail. Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert\r\nBlythe to the end of life.\r\n\r\nAs much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the\r\nlove of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and\r\ndislikes. One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket\r\nof apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight,\r\ncrying bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Anne luxuriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI love Diana so, Marilla.\r\nI cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up\r\nthat Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall\r\nI do? I hate her husband--I just hate him furiously. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been imagining\r\nit all out--the wedding and everything--Diana dressed in snowy garments,\r\nwith a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the\r\nbridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a\r\nbreaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Diana\r\ngoodbye-e-e--\xe2\x80\x9d Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\nMarilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no\r\nuse; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and\r\nunusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted\r\nin amazement. When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Anne Shirley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla as soon as she could speak, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nmust borrow trouble, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake borrow it handier home. I should\r\nthink you had an imagination, sure enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results\r\n\r\n\r\n|OCTOBER was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the\r\nhollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard\r\nwere royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the\r\nloveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned\r\nthemselves in aftermaths.\r\n\r\nAnne reveled in the world of color about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in\r\nwith her arms full of gorgeous boughs, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I live in a world\r\nwhere there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from\r\nSeptember to November, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Look at these maple branches. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey give you a thrill--several thrills? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to decorate my room\r\nwith them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessy things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably\r\ndeveloped. \xe2\x80\x9cYou clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors\r\nstuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, and dream in too, Marilla. And you know one can dream so much\r\nbetter in a room where there are pretty things. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put these\r\nboughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you don\xe2\x80\x99t drop leaves all over the stairs then. I\xe2\x80\x99m going on a\r\nmeeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlikely be home before dark. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get Matthew and Jerry their\r\nsupper, so mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to put the tea to draw until you sit\r\ndown at the table as you did last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was dreadful of me to forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\r\nwas the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it\r\ncrowded other things out. Matthew was so good. He never scolded a bit.\r\nHe put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as\r\nnot. And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story,\r\nMarilla. I forgot the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and\r\nMatthew said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell where the join came in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up\r\nand have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about\r\nyou this time. And--I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know if I\xe2\x80\x99m doing right--it may make\r\nyou more addlepated than ever--but you can ask Diana to come over and\r\nspend the afternoon with you and have tea here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne clasped her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cHow perfectly lovely! You _are_\r\nable to imagine things after all or else you\xe2\x80\x99d never have understood how\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and grown-uppish.\r\nNo fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company. Oh,\r\nMarilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed! The rosebud tea set! Well, what next? You know I never use\r\nthat except for the minister or the Aids. You\xe2\x80\x99ll put down the old brown\r\ntea set. But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time it was being used anyhow--I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to work.\r\nAnd you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and\r\npouring out the tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, shutting her eyes ecstatically. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nasking Diana if she takes sugar! I know she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t but of course I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nask her just as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. And then pressing her to take another\r\npiece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves. Oh, Marilla, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na wonderful sensation just to think of it. Can I take her into the spare\r\nroom to lay off her hat when she comes? And then into the parlor to\r\nsit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The sitting room will do for you and your company. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church\r\nsocial the other night. It\xe2\x80\x99s on the second shelf of the sitting-room\r\ncloset and you and Diana can have it if you like, and a cooky to eat\r\nwith it along in the afternoon, for I daresay Matthew \xe2\x80\x98ll be late coming\r\nin to tea since he\xe2\x80\x99s hauling potatoes to the vessel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne flew down to the hollow, past the Dryad\xe2\x80\x99s Bubble and up the spruce\r\npath to Orchard Slope, to ask Diana to tea. As a result just after\r\nMarilla had driven off to Carmody, Diana came over, dressed in _her_\r\nsecond-best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked\r\nout to tea. At other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without\r\nknocking; but now she knocked primly at the front door. And when Anne,\r\ndressed in her second best, as primly opened it, both little girls\r\nshook hands as gravely as if they had never met before. This unnatural\r\nsolemnity lasted until after Diana had been taken to the east gable to\r\nlay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room,\r\ntoes in position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Anne politely, just as if she had not\r\nseen Mrs. Barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very well, thank you. I suppose Mr. Cuthbert is hauling potatoes\r\nto the _lily sands_ this afternoon, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, who had ridden\r\ndown to Mr. Harmon Andrews\xe2\x80\x99s that morning in Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s cart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Our potato crop is very good this year. I hope your father\xe2\x80\x99s crop\r\nis good too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is fairly good, thank you. Have you picked many of your apples yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ever so many,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings,\r\nDiana. Marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree. Marilla\r\nis a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and cherry\r\npreserves for tea. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t good manners to tell your company what\r\nyou are going to give them to eat, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what she said we\r\ncould have to drink. Only it begins with an R and a C and it\xe2\x80\x99s bright\r\nred color. I love bright red drinks, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? They taste twice as good\r\nas any other color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground\r\nwith fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the\r\nafternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared\r\nthe green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples\r\nand talking as hard as they could. Diana had much to tell Anne of what\r\nwent on in school. She had to sit with Gertie Pye and she hated\r\nit; Gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made\r\nher--Diana\xe2\x80\x99s--blood run cold; Ruby Gillis had charmed all her warts\r\naway, true\xe2\x80\x99s you live, with a magic pebble that old Mary Joe from the\r\nCreek gave her. You had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw\r\nit away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the\r\nwarts would all go. Charlie Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s name was written up with Em White\xe2\x80\x99s\r\non the porch wall and Em White was _awful mad_ about it; Sam Boulter had\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csassed\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Phillips in class and Mr. Phillips whipped him and Sam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather came down to the school and dared Mr. Phillips to lay a hand on\r\none of his children again; and Mattie Andrews had a new red hood and a\r\nblue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were\r\nperfectly sickening; and Lizzie Wright didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to Mamie Wilson\r\nbecause Mamie Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s grown-up sister had cut out Lizzie Wright\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrown-up sister with her beau; and everybody missed Anne so and wished\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s come to school again; and Gilbert Blythe--\r\n\r\nBut Anne didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about Gilbert Blythe. She jumped up\r\nhurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial.\r\n\r\nAnne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no\r\nbottle of raspberry cordial there. Search revealed it away back on the\r\ntop shelf. Anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, please help yourself, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d she said politely. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have any just now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I wanted any after all those\r\napples.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue\r\nadmiringly, and then sipped it daintily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awfully nice raspberry cordial, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nraspberry cordial was so nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m real glad you like it. Take as much as you want. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nrun out and stir the fire up. There are so many responsibilities on a\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s mind when they\xe2\x80\x99re keeping house, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Anne came back from the kitchen Diana was drinking her second\r\nglassful of cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Anne, she offered\r\nno particular objection to the drinking of a third. The tumblerfuls were\r\ngenerous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nicest I ever drank,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much nicer than\r\nMrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s, although she brags of hers so much. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t taste a bit\r\nlike hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s raspberry cordial would prob\xe2\x80\x99ly be much nicer\r\nthan Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne loyally. \xe2\x80\x9cMarilla is a famous cook. She is\r\ntrying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go\r\nby rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I\r\nwas thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you\r\nwere desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I\r\nwent boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took\r\nthe smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the\r\ngraveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with\r\nyour tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who\r\nsacrificed her life for you. Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Diana.\r\nThe tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But\r\nI forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so\r\nessential to cakes, you know. Marilla was very cross and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a great trial to her. She was terribly mortified about the pudding\r\nsauce last week. We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there\r\nwas half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. Marilla said\r\nthere was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry\r\nshelf and cover it. I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana,\r\nbut when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun--of course I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nProtestant but I imagined I was a Catholic--taking the veil to bury a\r\nbroken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering\r\nthe pudding sauce. I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry.\r\nDiana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in\r\nthat pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out\r\nin the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters. Marilla was out\r\nmilking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I\xe2\x80\x99d give the\r\nsauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was\r\na frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow,\r\nwhichever they wanted to be, so I never thought about the pudding sauce\r\nagain and Marilla sent me out to pick apples. Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester\r\nRoss from Spencervale came here that morning. You know they are very\r\nstylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross. When Marilla called me in\r\ndinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. I tried to be as\r\npolite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to\r\nthink I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty. Everything\r\nwent right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand\r\nand the pitcher of pudding sauce _warmed up_, in the other. Diana, that\r\nwas a terrible moment. I remembered everything and I just stood up in\r\nmy place and shrieked out \xe2\x80\x98Marilla, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t use that pudding sauce.\r\nThere was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you before.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh,\r\nDiana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred.\r\nMrs. Chester Ross just _looked_ at me and I thought I would sink through\r\nthe floor with mortification. She is such a perfect housekeeper and\r\nfancy what she must have thought of us. Marilla turned red as fire but\r\nshe never said a word--then. She just carried that sauce and pudding out\r\nand brought in some strawberry preserves. She even offered me some, but\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow a mouthful. It was like heaping coals of fire on\r\nmy head. After Mrs. Chester Ross went away, Marilla gave me a dreadful\r\nscolding. Why, Diana, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her\r\nhands to her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m--I\xe2\x80\x99m awful sick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little thickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI--I--must go right\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of going home without your tea,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne in\r\ndistress. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get it right off--I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and put the tea down this very\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go home,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Diana, stupidly but determinedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me get you a lunch anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me give you a bit\r\nof fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa for\r\na little while and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be better. Where do you feel bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, and that was all she would say. In vain\r\nAnne pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of company going home without tea,\xe2\x80\x9d she mourned. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nDiana, do you suppose that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible you\xe2\x80\x99re really taking the\r\nsmallpox? If you are I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever forsake you. But I do wish you\xe2\x80\x99d stay till after tea. Where do you\r\nfeel bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awful dizzy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, she walked very dizzily. Anne, with tears of disappointment\r\nin her eyes, got Diana\xe2\x80\x99s hat and went with her as far as the Barry\r\nyard fence. Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she\r\nsorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the\r\npantry and got tea ready for Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone\r\nout of the performance.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from\r\ndawn till dusk Anne did not stir abroad from Green Gables. Monday\r\nafternoon Marilla sent her down to Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s on an errand. In a very\r\nshort space of time Anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling\r\ndown her cheeks. Into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face\r\ndownward on the sofa in an agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever has gone wrong now, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Marilla in doubt and\r\ndismay. \xe2\x80\x9cI do hope you haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered. Sit\r\nright up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sat up, tragedy personified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an\r\nawful state,\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says that I set Diana _drunk_ Saturday\r\nand sent her home in a disgraceful condition. And she says I must be a\r\nthoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she\xe2\x80\x99s never, never going to let\r\nDiana play with me again. Oh, Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99m just overcome with woe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla stared in blank amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet Diana drunk!\xe2\x80\x9d she said when she found her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne are you or\r\nMrs. Barry crazy? What on earth did you give her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a thing but raspberry cordial,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought\r\nraspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla--not even if they\r\ndrank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did. Oh, it sounds so--so--like\r\nMrs. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s husband! But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to set her drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrunk fiddlesticks!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry.\r\nThere on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one\r\ncontaining some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which\r\nshe was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort,\r\nMrs. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. And at the same time\r\nMarilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial\r\ndown in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told Anne.\r\n\r\nShe went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. Her face\r\nwas twitching in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. You went\r\nand gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow the difference yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never tasted it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was the cordial. I meant\r\nto be so--so--hospitable. Diana got awfully sick and had to go home.\r\nMrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk. She just laughed\r\nsilly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to\r\nsleep and slept for hours. Her mother smelled her breath and knew she\r\nwas drunk. She had a fearful headache all day yesterday. Mrs. Barry is\r\nso indignant. She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to\r\ndrink three glassfuls of anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, three\r\nof those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been\r\ncordial. Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are\r\nso down on me for making currant wine, although I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any for\r\nthree years ever since I found out that the minister didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve. I\r\njust kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see as you were to blame although I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry it happened so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must cry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart is broken. The stars in their courses\r\nfight against me, Marilla. Diana and I are parted forever. Oh, Marilla,\r\nI little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish, Anne. Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she\r\nfinds you\xe2\x80\x99re not to blame. I suppose she thinks you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it for a\r\nsilly joke or something of that sort. You\xe2\x80\x99d best go up this evening and\r\ntell her how it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana\xe2\x80\x99s injured mother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n sighed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d go, Marilla. You\xe2\x80\x99re so much more dignified\r\nthan I am. Likely she\xe2\x80\x99d listen to you quicker than to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, reflecting that it would probably be the\r\nwiser course. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more, Anne. It will be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she\r\ngot back from Orchard Slope. Anne was watching for her coming and flew\r\nto the porch door to meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, I know by your face that it\xe2\x80\x99s been no use,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nsorrowfully. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Barry won\xe2\x80\x99t forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Barry indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cOf all the unreasonable women\r\nI ever saw she\xe2\x80\x99s the worst. I told her it was all a mistake and you\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t to blame, but she just simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. And she rubbed\r\nit well in about my currant wine and how I\xe2\x80\x99d always said it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave the least effect on anybody. I just told her plainly that currant\r\nwine wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a\r\nchild I had to do with was so greedy I\xe2\x80\x99d sober her up with a right good\r\nspanking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very\r\nmuch distracted little soul in the porch behind her. Presently Anne\r\nstepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and\r\nsteadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the\r\nlog bridge and up through the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little\r\nmoon hanging low over the western woods. Mrs. Barry, coming to the door\r\nin answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on\r\nthe doorstep.\r\n\r\nHer face hardened. Mrs. Barry was a woman of strong prejudices and\r\ndislikes, and her anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always\r\nhardest to overcome. To do her justice, she really believed Anne had\r\nmade Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she was honestly\r\nanxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of\r\nfurther intimacy with such a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she said stiffly.\r\n\r\nAnne clasped her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me. I did not mean to--to--intoxicate\r\nDiana. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl\r\nthat kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all\r\nthe world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? I thought\r\nit was only raspberry cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry\r\ncordial. Oh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t say that you won\xe2\x80\x99t let Diana play with me any\r\nmore. If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech which would have softened good Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s heart in a\r\ntwinkling, had no effect on Mrs. Barry except to irritate her still\r\nmore. She was suspicious of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s big words and dramatic gestures and\r\nimagined that the child was making fun of her. So she said, coldly and\r\ncruelly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d better go home and behave yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s lips quivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you let me see Diana just once to say farewell?\xe2\x80\x9d she implored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana has gone over to Carmody with her father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Barry, going\r\nin and shutting the door.\r\n\r\nAnne went back to Green Gables calm with despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy last hope is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI went up and saw Mrs. Barry\r\nmyself and she treated me very insultingly. Marilla, I do _not_ think she\r\nis a well-bred woman. There is nothing more to do except to pray and I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t much hope that that\xe2\x80\x99ll do much good because, Marilla, I do not\r\nbelieve that God Himself can do very much with such an obstinate person\r\nas Mrs. Barry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say such things\xe2\x80\x9d rebuked Marilla, striving to\r\novercome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find\r\ngrowing upon her. And indeed, when she told the whole story to Matthew\r\nthat night, she did laugh heartily over Anne\xe2\x80\x99s tribulations.\r\n\r\nBut when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found\r\nthat Anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little soul,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, lifting a loose curl of hair from the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s tear-stained face. Then she bent down and kissed the flushed\r\ncheek on the pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. A New Interest in Life\r\n\r\n\r\n|THE next afternoon Anne, bending over her patchwork at the kitchen\r\nwindow, happened to glance out and beheld Diana down by the Dryad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBubble beckoning mysteriously. In a trice Anne was out of the house\r\nand flying down to the hollow, astonishment and hope struggling in\r\nher expressive eyes. But the hope faded when she saw Diana\xe2\x80\x99s dejected\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother hasn\xe2\x80\x99t relented?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.\r\n\r\nDiana shook her head mournfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and oh, Anne, she says I\xe2\x80\x99m never to play with you again. I\xe2\x80\x99ve cried\r\nand cried and I told her it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any use. I\r\nhad ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to\r\nyou. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she\xe2\x80\x99s timing me by the\r\nclock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes isn\xe2\x80\x99t very long to say an eternal farewell in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne\r\ntearfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget\r\nme, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress\r\nthee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I will,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll never have another bosom\r\nfriend--I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t love anybody as I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne, clasping her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you _love_ me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course I do. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne drew a long breath. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you _liked_ me of course but I\r\nnever hoped you _loved_ me. Why, Diana, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody could\r\nlove me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is\r\nwonderful! It\xe2\x80\x99s a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness\r\nof a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you devotedly, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana stanchly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I always will,\r\nyou may be sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will always love thee, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, solemnly extending her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my\r\nlonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt\r\nthou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure\r\nforevermore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got anything to cut it with?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Diana, wiping away the\r\ntears which Anne\xe2\x80\x99s affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and\r\nreturning to practicalities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Anne. She solemnly clipped one of Diana\xe2\x80\x99s curls. \xe2\x80\x9cFare thee well,\r\nmy beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side\r\nby side. But my heart will ever be faithful to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her hand\r\nto the latter whenever she turned to look back. Then she returned to\r\nthe house, not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic\r\nparting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all over,\xe2\x80\x9d she informed Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never have another\r\nfriend. I\xe2\x80\x99m really worse off than ever before, for I haven\xe2\x80\x99t Katie\r\nMaurice and Violetta now. And even if I had it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the same.\r\nSomehow, little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend.\r\nDiana and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring. It will\r\nbe sacred in my memory forever. I used the most pathetic language I\r\ncould think of and said \xe2\x80\x98thou\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98thee.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Thou\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98thee\xe2\x80\x99 seem so\r\nmuch more romantic than \xe2\x80\x98you.\xe2\x80\x99 Diana gave me a lock of her hair and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my\r\nlife. Please see that it is buried with me, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlive very long. Perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her\r\nMrs. Barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let Diana\r\ncome to my funeral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you\r\ncan talk, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla unsympathetically.\r\n\r\nThe following Monday Anne surprised Marilla by coming down from her room\r\nwith her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into\r\na line of determination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going back to school,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all there is left\r\nin life for me, now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me. In\r\nschool I can look at her and muse over days departed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better muse over your lessons and sums,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, concealing\r\nher delight at this development of the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re going back\r\nto school I hope we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear no more of breaking slates over people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheads and such carryings on. Behave yourself and do just what your\r\nteacher tells you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to be a model pupil,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Anne dolefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThere won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nmuch fun in it, I expect. Mr. Phillips said Minnie Andrews was a model\r\npupil and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a spark of imagination or life in her. She is\r\njust dull and poky and never seems to have a good time. But I feel so\r\ndepressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now. I\xe2\x80\x99m going round by\r\nthe road. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to go by the Birch Path all alone. I should\r\nweep bitter tears if I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne was welcomed back to school with open arms. Her imagination had\r\nbeen sorely missed in games, her voice in the singing and her dramatic\r\nability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour. Ruby Gillis\r\nsmuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading; Ella May\r\nMacPherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a\r\nfloral catalogue--a species of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea\r\nschool. Sophia Sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new\r\npattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons. Katie Boulter gave\r\nher a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and Julia Bell copied\r\ncarefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the\r\nfollowing effusion:\r\n\r\n\r\n  When twilight drops her curtain down\r\n  And pins it with a star\r\n  Remember that you have a friend\r\n  Though she may wander far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to be appreciated,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne rapturously to Marilla\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nThe girls were not the only scholars who \xe2\x80\x9cappreciated\xe2\x80\x9d her. When Anne\r\nwent to her seat after dinner hour--she had been told by Mr. Phillips to\r\nsit with the model Minnie Andrews--she found on her desk a big luscious\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrawberry apple.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she\r\nremembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew\r\nwas in the old Blythe orchard on the other side of the Lake of Shining\r\nWaters. Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and\r\nostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief. The apple lay\r\nuntouched on her desk until the next morning, when little Timothy\r\nAndrews, who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one\r\nof his perquisites. Charlie Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened\r\nwith striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary\r\npencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met\r\nwith a more favorable reception. Anne was graciously pleased to accept\r\nit and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated\r\nyouth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to\r\nmake such fearful errors in his dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him in\r\nafter school to rewrite it.\r\n\r\nBut as,\r\n\r\n  The Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s pageant shorn of Brutus\xe2\x80\x99 bust\r\n  Did but of Rome\xe2\x80\x99s best son remind her more,\r\n\r\nso the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from Diana Barry who\r\nwas sitting with Gertie Pye embittered Anne\xe2\x80\x99s little triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana might just have smiled at me once, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d she mourned to\r\nMarilla that night. But the next morning a note most fearfully and\r\nwonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\nDear Anne (ran the former)\r\n\r\n\r\nMother says I\xe2\x80\x99m not to play with you or talk to you even in school. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault and don\xe2\x80\x99t be cross at me, because I love you as much\r\nas ever. I miss you awfully to tell all my secrets to and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nGertie Pye one bit. I made you one of the new bookmarkers out of red\r\ntissue paper. They are awfully fashionable now and only three girls in\r\nschool know how to make them. When you look at it remember\r\n\r\nYour true friend\r\n\r\nDiana Barry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply\r\nback to the other side of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy own darling Diana:--\r\n\r\nOf course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother.\r\nOur spirits can commune. I shall keep your lovely present forever.\r\nMinnie Andrews is a very nice little girl--although she has no\r\nimagination--but after having been Diana\xe2\x80\x99s busum friend I cannot be\r\nMinnie\xe2\x80\x99s. Please excuse mistakes because my spelling isn\xe2\x80\x99t very good\r\nyet, although much improoved.\r\n\r\nYours until death us do part\r\n\r\nAnne or Cordelia Shirley.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight. A. _or_ C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarilla pessimistically expected more trouble since Anne had again begun\r\nto go to school. But none developed. Perhaps Anne caught something of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cmodel\xe2\x80\x9d spirit from Minnie Andrews; at least she got on very well\r\nwith Mr. Phillips thenceforth. She flung herself into her studies heart\r\nand soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe.\r\nThe rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured\r\non Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing\r\ncannot be said of Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for\r\nholding grudges. She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. She\r\nwould not stoop to admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork,\r\nbecause that would have been to acknowledge his existence which Anne\r\npersistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated\r\nbetween them. Now Gilbert was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with\r\na toss of her long red braids, spelled him down. One morning Gilbert had\r\nall his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard\r\non the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with\r\ndecimals the entire evening before, would be first. One awful day they\r\nwere ties and their names were written up together. It was almost as bad\r\nas a take-notice and Anne\xe2\x80\x99s mortification was as evident as Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsatisfaction. When the written examinations at the end of each month\r\nwere held the suspense was terrible. The first month Gilbert came out\r\nthree marks ahead. The second Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was\r\nmarred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the\r\nwhole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had\r\nfelt the sting of his defeat.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly\r\ndetermined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress\r\nunder any kind of teacher. By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were\r\nboth promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the\r\nelements of \xe2\x80\x9cthe branches\xe2\x80\x9d--by which Latin, geometry, French, and\r\nalgebra were meant. In geometry Anne met her Waterloo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly awful stuff, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nbe able to make head or tail of it. There is no scope for imagination in\r\nit at all. Mr. Phillips says I\xe2\x80\x99m the worst dunce he ever saw at it.\r\nAnd Gil--I mean some of the others are so smart at it. It is extremely\r\nmortifying, Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven Diana gets along better than I do. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being beaten\r\nby Diana. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with\r\nan _inextinguishable_ love. It makes me very sad at times to think about\r\nher. But really, Marilla, one can\xe2\x80\x99t stay sad very long in such an\r\ninteresting world, can one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. Anne to the Rescue\r\n\r\n\r\n|ALL things great are wound up with all things little. At first glance\r\nit might not seem that the decision of a certain Canadian Premier to\r\ninclude Prince Edward Island in a political tour could have much or\r\nanything to do with the fortunes of little Anne Shirley at Green Gables.\r\nBut it had.\r\n\r\nIt was a January the Premier came, to address his loyal supporters and\r\nsuch of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass\r\nmeeting held in Charlottetown. Most of the Avonlea people were on\r\nPremier\xe2\x80\x99s side of politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly\r\nall the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty\r\nmiles away. Mrs. Rachel Lynde had gone too. Mrs. Rachel Lynde was a\r\nred-hot politician and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed that the political rally\r\ncould be carried through without her, although she was on the opposite\r\nside of politics. So she went to town and took her husband--Thomas would\r\nbe useful in looking after the horse--and Marilla Cuthbert with her.\r\nMarilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself, and as she thought\r\nit might be her only chance to see a real live Premier, she promptly\r\ntook it, leaving Anne and Matthew to keep house until her return the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nHence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely\r\nat the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green\r\nGables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned\r\nWaterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the\r\nwindowpanes. Matthew nodded over a _Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Advocate_ on the sofa and\r\nAnne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite\r\nsundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that\r\nJane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was\r\nwarranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert\r\nBlythe\xe2\x80\x99s triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf\r\nand tried to imagine it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause then you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to sympathize\r\nwith me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t sympathize properly if you\xe2\x80\x99ve never studied it. It is\r\ncasting a cloud over my whole life. I\xe2\x80\x99m such a dunce at it, Matthew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess you\xe2\x80\x99re all right\r\nat anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair\xe2\x80\x99s store at Carmody\r\nthat you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid\r\nprogress. \xe2\x80\x98Rapid progress\xe2\x80\x99 was his very words. There\xe2\x80\x99s them as runs down\r\nTeddy Phillips and says he ain\xe2\x80\x99t much of a teacher, but I guess he\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was \xe2\x80\x9call right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99d get on better with geometry if only he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change\r\nthe letters,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI learn the proposition off by heart and\r\nthen he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what\r\nare in the book and I get all mixed up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a teacher should\r\ntake such a mean advantage, do you? We\xe2\x80\x99re studying agriculture now and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve found out at last what makes the roads red. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great comfort.\r\nI wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde\r\nsays Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa\r\nand that it\xe2\x80\x99s an awful warning to the electors. She says if women were\r\nallowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you\r\nvote, Matthew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConservative,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of\r\nMatthew\xe2\x80\x99s religion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m Conservative too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad because\r\nGil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips\r\nis a Grit too because Prissy Andrews\xe2\x80\x99s father is one, and Ruby Gillis\r\nsays that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother in religion and her father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever go courting, Matthew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, no, I dunno\xe2\x80\x99s I ever did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, who had certainly\r\nnever thought of such a thing in his whole existence.\r\n\r\nAnne reflected with her chin in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be rather interesting, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis\r\nsays when she grows up she\xe2\x80\x99s going to have ever so many beaus on the\r\nstring and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too\r\nexciting. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis\r\nknows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big\r\nsisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot\r\ncakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening.\r\nHe says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is\r\nstudying for Queen\xe2\x80\x99s too, and I should think she needed help a lot more\r\nthan Prissy because she\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much stupider, but he never goes to\r\nhelp her in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this\r\nworld that I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand very well, Matthew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,\xe2\x80\x9d acknowledged\r\nMatthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow myself to\r\nopen that new book Jane lent me until I\xe2\x80\x99m through. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible\r\ntemptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there\r\njust as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book\r\nthat makes me cry. But I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry that book into the sitting\r\nroom and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must\r\n_not_ give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if\r\nI implore you on my bended knees. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to say resist\r\ntemptation, but it\xe2\x80\x99s ever so much easier to resist it if you can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nthe key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets,\r\nMatthew? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like some russets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno but what I would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, who never ate\r\nrussets but knew Anne\xe2\x80\x99s weakness for them.\r\n\r\nJust as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of\r\nrussets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside\r\nand the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana\r\nBarry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around\r\nher head. Anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise,\r\nand plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder\r\nand were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day,\r\nby Marilla, who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nset on fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever is the matter, Diana?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cHas your mother relented\r\nat last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne, do come quick,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Diana nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cMinnie May is\r\nawful sick--she\xe2\x80\x99s got croup. Young Mary Joe says--and Father and Mother\r\nare away to town and there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody to go for the doctor. Minnie May is\r\nawful bad and Young Mary Joe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do--and oh, Anne, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nso scared!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew, without a word, reached out for cap and coat, slipped past\r\nDiana and away into the darkness of the yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Anne, who was hurrying on hood and jacket. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it as well as\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99d said so. Matthew and I are such kindred spirits I can read his\r\nthoughts without words at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99ll find the doctor at Carmody,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow that Dr. Blair went to town and I guess Dr. Spencer would go too.\r\nYoung Mary Joe never saw anybody with croup and Mrs. Lynde is away. Oh,\r\nAnne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, Di,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cI know exactly what to do for\r\ncroup. You forget that Mrs. Hammond had twins three times. When you look\r\nafter three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. They\r\nall had croup regularly. Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle--you\r\nmayn\xe2\x80\x99t have any at your house. Come on now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through\r\nLover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too\r\ndeep to go by the shorter wood way. Anne, although sincerely sorry\r\nfor Minnie May, was far from being insensible to the romance of the\r\nsituation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a\r\nkindred spirit.\r\n\r\nThe night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy\r\nslope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the\r\ndark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the\r\nwind whistling through them. Anne thought it was truly delightful to go\r\nskimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend\r\nwho had been so long estranged.\r\n\r\nMinnie May, aged three, was really very sick. She lay on the kitchen\r\nsofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard\r\nall over the house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl\r\nfrom the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children\r\nduring her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of\r\nthinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.\r\n\r\nAnne went to work with skill and promptness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMinnie May has croup all right; she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bad, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them\r\nworse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I\xe2\x80\x99ve filled it up, and,\r\nMary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt your\r\nfeelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d any imagination. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll undress Minnie May and put her to bed\r\nand you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give\r\nher a dose of ipecac first of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMinnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up\r\nthree pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once,\r\nbut many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls\r\nworked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe,\r\nhonestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated\r\nmore water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.\r\n\r\nIt was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been\r\nobliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need\r\nfor assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was awfully near giving up in despair,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cShe got\r\nworse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were,\r\neven the last pair. I actually thought she was going to choke to death.\r\nI gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose\r\nwent down I said to myself--not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had\r\nto say it to myself just to relieve my feelings--\xe2\x80\x98This is the last\r\nlingering hope and I fear, tis a vain one.\xe2\x80\x99 But in about three minutes\r\nshe coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away. You must\r\njust imagine my relief, doctor, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t express it in words. You\r\nknow there are some things that cannot be expressed in words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded the doctor. He looked at Anne as if he were\r\nthinking some things about her that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expressed in words.\r\nLater on, however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert\xe2\x80\x99s is as smart as\r\nthey make \xe2\x80\x98em. I tell you she saved that baby\xe2\x80\x99s life, for it would have\r\nbeen too late by the time I got there. She seems to have a skill and\r\npresence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age. I never saw\r\nanything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne had gone home in the wonderful, white-frosted winter morning, heavy\r\neyed from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to Matthew as\r\nthey crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy\r\narch of the Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane maples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Matthew, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a wonderful morning? The world looks like\r\nsomething God had just imagined for His own pleasure, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Those\r\ntrees look as if I could blow them away with a breath--pouf! I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad\r\nI live in a world where there are white frosts, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? And I\xe2\x80\x99m so\r\nglad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins after all. If she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t have known what to do for Minnie May. I\xe2\x80\x99m real sorry I was\r\never cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins. But, oh, Matthew, I\xe2\x80\x99m so\r\nsleepy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to school. I just know I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my eyes open\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99d be so stupid. But I hate to stay home, for Gil--some of\r\nthe others will get head of the class, and it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to get up\r\nagain--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you\r\nhave when you do get up, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99ll manage all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, looking at\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just\r\ngo right to bed and have a good sleep. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do all the chores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it\r\nwas well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and\r\ndescended to the kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the\r\nmeantime, was sitting knitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, did you see the Premier?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Anne at once. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he look\r\nlike Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he never got to be Premier on account of his looks,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a nose as that man had! But he can speak. I was proud of\r\nbeing a Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no\r\nuse for him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself\r\nsome blue plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry.\r\nMatthew has been telling me about last night. I must say it was\r\nfortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had any idea myself, for\r\nI never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad your dinner. I can tell by the look of you that you\xe2\x80\x99re just full up\r\nwith speeches, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then\r\nfor she knew if she did Anne\xe2\x80\x99s consequent excitement would lift her\r\nclear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.\r\nNot until Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She wanted to see you, but I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wake you up. She says you saved Minnie May\xe2\x80\x99s life, and she is\r\nvery sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. She\r\nsays she knows now you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again. You\xe2\x80\x99re to go\r\nover this evening if you like for Diana can\xe2\x80\x99t stir outside the door\r\non account of a bad cold she caught last night. Now, Anne Shirley, for\r\npity\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t fly up into the air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated\r\nwith the flame of her spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, can I go right now--without washing my dishes? I\xe2\x80\x99ll wash\r\nthem when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so\r\nunromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, run along,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla indulgently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley--are you\r\ncrazy? Come back this instant and put something on you. I might as well\r\ncall to the wind. She\xe2\x80\x99s gone without a cap or wrap. Look at her tearing\r\nthrough the orchard with her hair streaming. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a mercy if she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t catch her death of cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy\r\nplaces. Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like\r\nsparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal\r\nrose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce. The tinkles\r\nof sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through\r\nthe frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart and on her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I\r\nhave a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she\r\nwas so sorry and she could never repay me. I felt fearfully embarrassed,\r\nMarilla, but I just said as politely as I could, \xe2\x80\x98I have no hard\r\nfeelings for you, Mrs. Barry. I assure you once for all that I did not\r\nmean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the\r\nmantle of oblivion.\xe2\x80\x99 That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s head. And Diana\r\nand I had a lovely afternoon. Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch\r\nher aunt over at Carmody taught her. Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but\r\nus, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. Diana\r\ngave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of\r\npoetry:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cIf you love me as I love you\r\n      Nothing but death can part us two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is true, Marilla. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us\r\nsit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews.\r\nWe had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out,\r\nMarilla, just as if I was real company. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what a thrill\r\nit gave me. Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before.\r\nAnd we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of\r\npreserves, Marilla. And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said \xe2\x80\x98Pa,\r\nwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you pass the biscuits to Anne?\xe2\x80\x99 It must be lovely to be grown\r\nup, Marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, with a brief sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyway, when I am grown up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne decidedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always\r\ngoing to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never laugh\r\nwhen they use big words. I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. After tea Diana and I made taffy. The taffy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\ngood, I suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before.\r\nDiana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and\r\nlet it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat\r\nwalked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of\r\nit was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come\r\nover as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses\r\nto me all the way down to Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane. I assure you, Marilla, that I\r\nfeel like praying tonight and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to think out a special brand-new\r\nprayer in honor of the occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. A Concert a Catastrophe and a Confession\r\n\r\n\r\n|MARILLA, can I go over to see Diana just for a minute?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anne,\r\nrunning breathlessly down from the east gable one February evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and Diana walked home from school together and\r\nthen stood down there in the snow for half an hour more, your tongues\r\ngoing the whole blessed time, clickety-clack. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nvery badly off to see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she wants to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has something very\r\nimportant to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know she has?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she just signaled to me from her window. We have arranged a\r\nway to signal with our candles and cardboard. We set the candle on the\r\nwindow sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth. So\r\nmany flashes mean a certain thing. It was my idea, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant you it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next\r\nthing you\xe2\x80\x99ll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling\r\nnonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we\xe2\x80\x99re very careful, Marilla. And it\xe2\x80\x99s so interesting. Two flashes\r\nmean, \xe2\x80\x98Are you there?\xe2\x80\x99 Three mean \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 and four \xe2\x80\x98no.\xe2\x80\x99 Five mean, \xe2\x80\x98Come\r\nover as soon as possible, because I have something important to reveal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDiana has just signaled five flashes, and I\xe2\x80\x99m really suffering to know\r\nwhat it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan go, but you\xe2\x80\x99re to be back here in just ten minutes, remember that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time, although\r\nprobably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the\r\ndiscussion of Diana\xe2\x80\x99s important communication within the limits of ten\r\nminutes. But at least she had made good use of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, what do you think? You know tomorrow is Diana\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\r\nWell, her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from\r\nschool and stay all night with her. And her cousins are coming over from\r\nNewbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at\r\nthe hall tomorrow night. And they are going to take Diana and me to the\r\nconcert--if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me go, that is. You will, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Marilla? Oh,\r\nI feel so excited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can calm down then, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not going. You\xe2\x80\x99re better at home\r\nin your own bed, and as for that club concert, it\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense, and\r\nlittle girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to begin gadding about\r\nto concerts and staying out all hours of the night. Pretty doings for\r\nchildren. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at Mrs. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s letting Diana go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s such a very special occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d mourned Anne, on the verge of\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x9cDiana has only one birthday in a year. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as if birthdays\r\nwere common things, Marilla. Prissy Andrews is going to recite \xe2\x80\x98Curfew\r\nMust Not Ring Tonight.\xe2\x80\x99 That is such a good moral piece, Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir are going to\r\nsing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns.\r\nAnd oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s going to give an address. That will be just about the same thing as\r\na sermon. Please, mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I go, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard what I said, Anne, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Take off your boots now and go\r\nto bed. It\xe2\x80\x99s past eight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s just one more thing, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, with the air of\r\nproducing the last shot in her locker. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Barry told Diana that we\r\nmight sleep in the spare-room bed. Think of the honor of your little\r\nAnne being put in the spare-room bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an honor you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get along without. Go to bed, Anne, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t let me hear another word out of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Anne, with tears rolling over her cheeks, had gone sorrowfully\r\nupstairs, Matthew, who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge\r\nduring the whole dialogue, opened his eyes and said decidedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, Marilla, I think you ought to let Anne go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t then,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s bringing this child up,\r\nMatthew, you or me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, you,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t interfere then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t interfering. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t interfering to have your own\r\nopinion. And my opinion is that you ought to let Anne go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d think I ought to let Anne go to the moon if she took the notion,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s amiable rejoinder. \xe2\x80\x9cI might have let her\r\nspend the night with Diana, if that was all. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of this\r\nconcert plan. She\xe2\x80\x99d go there and catch cold like as not, and have her\r\nhead filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would unsettle her for\r\na week. I understand that child\xe2\x80\x99s disposition and what\xe2\x80\x99s good for it\r\nbetter than you, Matthew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you ought to let Anne go,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Matthew firmly. Argument\r\nwas not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly was.\r\nMarilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence. The\r\nnext morning, when Anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry,\r\nMatthew paused on his way out to the barn to say to Marilla again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you ought to let Anne go, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered. Then she\r\nyielded to the inevitable and said tartly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, she can go, since nothing else \xe2\x80\x98ll please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne flew out of the pantry, dripping dishcloth in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, Marilla, say those blessed words again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess once is enough to say them. This is Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s doings and I\r\nwash my hands of it. If you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or\r\ncoming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night, don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me,\r\nblame Matthew. Anne Shirley, you\xe2\x80\x99re dripping greasy water all over the\r\nfloor. I never saw such a careless child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know I\xe2\x80\x99m a great trial to you, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne repentantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make so many mistakes. But then just think of all the mistakes I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make, although I might. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some sand and scrub up the spots\r\nbefore I go to school. Oh, Marilla, my heart was just set on going to\r\nthat concert. I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other\r\ngirls talk about them in school I feel so out of it. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\njust how I felt about it, but you see Matthew did. Matthew understands\r\nme, and it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to be understood, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in\r\nschool. Gilbert Blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out\r\nof sight in mental arithmetic. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s consequent humiliation was\r\nless than it might have been, however, in view of the concert and the\r\nspare-room bed. She and Diana talked so constantly about it all day that\r\nwith a stricter teacher than Mr. Phillips dire disgrace must inevitably\r\nhave been their portion.\r\n\r\nAnne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going\r\nto the concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school. The\r\nAvonlea Debating Club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several\r\nsmaller free entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission\r\nten cents, in aid of the library. The Avonlea young people had been\r\npracticing for weeks, and all the scholars were especially interested in\r\nit by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part.\r\nEverybody in school over nine years of age expected to go, except Carrie\r\nSloane, whose father shared Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s opinions about small girls going\r\nout to night concerts. Carrie Sloane cried into her grammar all the\r\nafternoon and felt that life was not worth living.\r\n\r\nFor Anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and\r\nincreased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive\r\necstasy in the concert itself. They had a \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly elegant tea;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen came the delicious occupation of dressing in Diana\xe2\x80\x99s little room\r\nupstairs. Diana did Anne\xe2\x80\x99s front hair in the new pompadour style and\r\nAnne tied Diana\xe2\x80\x99s bows with the especial knack she possessed; and they\r\nexperimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging\r\ntheir back hair. At last they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes\r\nglowing with excitement.\r\n\r\nTrue, Anne could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain\r\nblack tam and shapeless, tight-sleeved, homemade gray-cloth coat with\r\nDiana\xe2\x80\x99s jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket. But she remembered in\r\ntime that she had an imagination and could use it.\r\n\r\nThen Diana\xe2\x80\x99s cousins, the Murrays from Newbridge, came; they all crowded\r\ninto the big pung sleigh, among straw and furry robes. Anne reveled in\r\nthe drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with\r\nthe snow crisping under the runners. There was a magnificent sunset, and\r\nthe snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to\r\nrim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with\r\nwine and fire. Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed\r\nlike the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Anne, squeezing Diana\xe2\x80\x99s mittened hand under the\r\nfur robe, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t it all like a beautiful dream? Do I really look the\r\nsame as usual? I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in\r\nmy looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look awfully nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, who having just received a\r\ncompliment from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got the loveliest color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe program that night was a series of \xe2\x80\x9cthrills\xe2\x80\x9d for at least one\r\nlistener in the audience, and, as Anne assured Diana, every succeeding\r\nthrill was thrillier than the last. When Prissy Andrews, attired in\r\na new pink-silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white\r\nthroat and real carnations in her hair--rumor whispered that the master\r\nhad sent all the way to town for them for her--\xe2\x80\x9cclimbed the slimy\r\nladder, dark without one ray of light,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne shivered in luxurious\r\nsympathy; when the choir sang \xe2\x80\x9cFar Above the Gentle Daisies\xe2\x80\x9d Anne gazed\r\nat the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels; when Sam Sloane\r\nproceeded to explain and illustrate \xe2\x80\x9cHow Sockery Set a Hen\xe2\x80\x9d Anne laughed\r\nuntil people sitting near her laughed too, more out of sympathy with her\r\nthan with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in\r\nAvonlea; and when Mr. Phillips gave Mark Antony\xe2\x80\x99s oration over the\r\ndead body of Caesar in the most heart-stirring tones--looking at Prissy\r\nAndrews at the end of every sentence--Anne felt that she could rise and\r\nmutiny on the spot if but one Roman citizen led the way.\r\n\r\nOnly one number on the program failed to interest her. When Gilbert\r\nBlythe recited \xe2\x80\x9cBingen on the Rhine\xe2\x80\x9d Anne picked up Rhoda Murray\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlibrary book and read it until he had finished, when she sat rigidly\r\nstiff and motionless while Diana clapped her hands until they tingled.\r\n\r\nIt was eleven when they got home, sated with dissipation, but with the\r\nexceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come. Everybody\r\nseemed asleep and the house was dark and silent. Anne and Diana tiptoed\r\ninto the parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened.\r\nIt was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the\r\ngrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s undress here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so nice and warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t it been a delightful time?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne rapturously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must\r\nbe splendid to get up and recite there. Do you suppose we will ever be\r\nasked to do it, Diana?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course, someday. They\xe2\x80\x99re always wanting the big scholars to\r\nrecite. Gilbert Blythe does often and he\xe2\x80\x99s only two years older than us.\r\nOh, Anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him? When he came to\r\nthe line,\r\n\r\n           \xe2\x80\x98_There\xe2\x80\x99s Another_, not _a sister_,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nhe looked right down at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne with dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are my bosom friend, but I cannot\r\nallow even you to speak to me of that person. Are you ready for bed?\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s run a race and see who\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the bed first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suggestion appealed to Diana. The two little white-clad figures flew\r\ndown the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed\r\nat the same moment. And then--something--moved beneath them, there was a\r\ngasp and a cry--and somebody said in muffled accents:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerciful goodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne and Diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed\r\nand out of the room. They only knew that after one frantic rush they\r\nfound themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, who was it--_what_ was it?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Anne, her teeth chattering with\r\ncold and fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Aunt Josephine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, gasping with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne,\r\nit was Aunt Josephine, however she came to be there. Oh, and I know she\r\nwill be furious. It\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful--it\xe2\x80\x99s really dreadful--but did you ever\r\nknow anything so funny, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is your Aunt Josephine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s aunt and she lives in Charlottetown. She\xe2\x80\x99s awfully\r\nold--seventy anyhow--and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she was _ever_ a little girl. We\r\nwere expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon. She\xe2\x80\x99s awfully prim\r\nand proper and she\xe2\x80\x99ll scold dreadfully about this, I know. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to sleep with Minnie May--and you can\xe2\x80\x99t think how she kicks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Josephine Barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next\r\nmorning. Mrs. Barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you have a good time last night? I tried to stay awake until you\r\ncame home, for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you\r\nwould have to go upstairs after all, but I was so tired I fell asleep. I\r\nhope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t disturb your aunt, Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana preserved a discreet silence, but she and Anne exchanged furtive\r\nsmiles of guilty amusement across the table. Anne hurried home after\r\nbreakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which\r\npresently resulted in the Barry household until the late afternoon, when\r\nshe went down to Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s on an errand for Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nBarry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody. She\xe2\x80\x99s feeling\r\nreal worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she\r\ngot up this morning--and Josephine Barry\xe2\x80\x99s temper is no joke, I can tell\r\nyou that. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to Diana at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Diana\xe2\x80\x99s fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne contritely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was mine. I\r\nsuggested racing to see who would get into bed first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that idea came out of your head. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s made a nice lot of\r\ntrouble, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month, but\r\nshe declares she won\xe2\x80\x99t stay another day and is going right back to town\r\ntomorrow, Sunday and all as it is. She\xe2\x80\x99d have gone today if they could\r\nhave taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter\xe2\x80\x99s music lessons\r\nfor Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a\r\ntomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The\r\nBarrys must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they\xe2\x80\x99d like to keep\r\non the good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn\xe2\x80\x99t say just that to\r\nme, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty good judge of human nature, that\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m such an unlucky girl,\xe2\x80\x9d mourned Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always getting into\r\nscrapes myself and getting my best friends--people I\xe2\x80\x99d shed my heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood for--into them too. Can you tell me why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re too heedless and impulsive, child, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. You\r\nnever stop to think--whatever comes into your head to say or do you say\r\nor do it without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the best of it,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething just flashes\r\ninto your mind, so exciting, and you must out with it. If you stop to\r\nthink it over you spoil it all. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you never felt that yourself,\r\nMrs. Lynde?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, Mrs. Lynde had not. She shook her head sagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must learn to think a little, Anne, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. The proverb you\r\nneed to go by is \xe2\x80\x98Look before you leap\xe2\x80\x99--especially into spare-room\r\nbeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke, but Anne remained\r\npensive. She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her\r\neyes appeared very serious. When she left Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s she took her way\r\nacross the crusted fields to Orchard Slope. Diana met her at the kitchen\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance\r\nover her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was fairly\r\ndancing with rage, Anne. Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the\r\nworst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed\r\nof the way they had brought me up. She says she won\xe2\x80\x99t stay and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care. But Father and Mother do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell them it was my fault?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s likely I\xe2\x80\x99d do such a thing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana with just scorn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame\r\nas you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m going in to tell her myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne resolutely.\r\n\r\nDiana stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, you\xe2\x80\x99d never! why--she\xe2\x80\x99ll eat you alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t frighten me any more than I am frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather walk up to a cannon\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do it, Diana. It\r\nwas my fault and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to confess. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had practice in confessing,\r\nfortunately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s in the room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can go in if you want to. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99ll do a bit of good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den--that is to\r\nsay, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly.\r\nA sharp \xe2\x80\x9cCome in\xe2\x80\x9d followed.\r\n\r\nMiss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by\r\nthe fire, her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her\r\ngold-rimmed glasses. She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see\r\nDiana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up\r\nwith a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Anne of Green Gables,\xe2\x80\x9d said the small visitor tremulously, clasping\r\nher hands with her characteristic gesture, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to confess, if\r\nyou please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfess what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I\r\nsuggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.\r\nDiana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it\r\nis to blame her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at\r\nleast. Such carryings on in a respectable house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we were only in fun,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you ought to forgive\r\nus, Miss Barry, now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve apologized. And anyhow, please forgive\r\nDiana and let her have her music lessons. Diana\xe2\x80\x99s heart is set on her\r\nmusic lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your\r\nheart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be\r\ncross with me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so used in my early days to having people cross\r\nat me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch of the snap had gone out of the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes by this time\r\nand was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said\r\nseverely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.\r\nLittle girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long\r\nand arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t _know_, but I can _imagine_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it must\r\nhave been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have\r\nyou any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in\r\nour place. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly\r\nscared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are\r\nused to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel\r\nlike if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a\r\nsound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen\r\noutside, to give a great gasp of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it\xe2\x80\x99s so long since I used\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as\r\nmine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me\r\nabout yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to, because\r\nyou seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred\r\nspirit although you don\xe2\x80\x99t look very much like it. But it is my duty to\r\ngo home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind\r\nlady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but\r\nit is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on\r\nthe bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive\r\nDiana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me\r\noccasionally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barry.\r\n\r\nThat evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the\r\nsenior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better\r\nacquainted with that Anne-girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she said frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe amuses me, and\r\nat my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla\xe2\x80\x99s only comment when she heard the story was, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n This was for Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.\r\n\r\nMiss Barry stayed her month out and over. She was a more agreeable guest\r\nthan usual, for Anne kept her in good humor. They became firm friends.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Barry went away she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you\xe2\x80\x99re to visit me and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Barry was a kindred spirit, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne confided to Marilla.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so to look at her, but she is. You don\xe2\x80\x99t find it\r\nright out at first, as in Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s case, but after a while you come\r\nto see it. Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsplendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. A Good Imagination Gone Wrong\r\n\r\n\r\n|SPRING had come once more to Green Gables--the beautiful capricious,\r\nreluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a\r\nsuccession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles\r\nof resurrection and growth. The maples in Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane were red budded\r\nand little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad\xe2\x80\x99s Bubble. Away up in\r\nthe barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s place, the Mayflowers blossomed\r\nout, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the\r\nschool girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming\r\nhome in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of\r\nflowery spoil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no\r\nMayflowers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cDiana says perhaps they have something better,\r\nbut there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anything better than Mayflowers, could there,\r\nMarilla? And Diana says if they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they are like they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmiss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it\r\nwould be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_\r\nto miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think\r\nthey must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this\r\nis their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our\r\nlunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.\r\nCharlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very _fashionable_\r\nto dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews\r\nand I heard him to say \xe2\x80\x98sweets to the sweet.\xe2\x80\x99 He got that out of a\r\nbook, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some\r\nMayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We\r\nmade wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the\r\ntime came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,\r\nwith our bouquets and wreaths, singing \xe2\x80\x98My Home on the Hill.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, it was\r\nso thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s folks rushed out to see us\r\nand everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a\r\nreal sensation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much wonder! Such silly doings!\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s response.\r\n\r\nAfter the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled\r\nwith them. Anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent\r\nsteps and worshiping eyes, as if she trod on holy ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomehow,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m going through here I don\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\ncare whether Gil--whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not. But\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m up in school it\xe2\x80\x99s all different and I care as much as ever.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s such a lot of different Annes in me. I sometimes think that is\r\nwhy I\xe2\x80\x99m such a troublesome person. If I was just the one Anne it would\r\nbe ever so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be half so\r\ninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the\r\nfrogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the\r\nLake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover\r\nfields and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window.\r\nShe had been studying her lessons, but it had grown too dark to see the\r\nbook, so she had fallen into wide-eyed reverie, looking out past the\r\nboughs of the Snow Queen, once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom.\r\n\r\nIn all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged. The\r\nwalls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly\r\nand yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was\r\naltered. It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to\r\npervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses\r\nand ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms\r\non the table. It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its\r\nvivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had\r\ntapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and\r\nmoonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s freshly\r\nironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat down with\r\na short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and\r\nalthough the pain had gone she felt weak and \xe2\x80\x9ctuckered out,\xe2\x80\x9d as she\r\nexpressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla. I\r\nwould have endured it joyfully for your sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer\r\nmistakes than usual. Of course it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly necessary to starch\r\nMatthew\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven\r\nto warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of\r\nleaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be your way\r\nevidently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeadaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne penitently. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought about that\r\npie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt\r\n_instinctively_ that there was something missing on the dinner table. I\r\nwas firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to\r\nimagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until\r\nI put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to\r\nimagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a\r\nhandsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that\r\nis how I came to forget the pie. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I starched the\r\nhandkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a\r\nname for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmost ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple trees on it and the\r\nbrook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it would be\r\nsplendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbirthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about that pie\r\nand the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because it\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nanniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything special.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never\r\nforget it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem so important to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for a year and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so\r\nhappy. Of course, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my troubles, but one can live down troubles.\r\nAre you sorry you kept me, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how\r\nshe could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, \xe2\x80\x9cno, not exactly\r\nsorry. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and\r\nask Mrs. Barry if she\xe2\x80\x99ll lend me Diana\xe2\x80\x99s apron pattern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--it\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s too dark,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo dark? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s only twilight. And goodness knows you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone over\r\noften enough after dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go over early in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get up at\r\nsunrise and go over, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? I want that pattern to\r\ncut out your new apron this evening. Go at once and be smart too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go around by the road, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, taking up her hat\r\nreluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo by the road and waste half an hour! I\xe2\x80\x99d like to catch you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne desperately.\r\n\r\nMarilla stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted\r\nWood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spruce wood over the brook,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who\r\nhas been telling you such stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cDiana and I just imagined the wood was\r\nhaunted. All the places around here are so--so--_commonplace_. We just got\r\nthis up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is\r\nso very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ngloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There\xe2\x80\x99s a white\r\nlady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings\r\nher hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a\r\ndeath in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the\r\ncorner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers\r\non your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower\r\nat you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go through the\r\nHaunted Wood after dark now for anything. I\xe2\x80\x99d be sure that white things\r\nwould reach out from behind the trees and grab me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ever anyone hear the like!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Marilla, who had\r\nlistened in dumb amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you\r\nbelieve all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot believe _exactly_,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it in\r\ndaylight. But after dark, Marilla, it\xe2\x80\x99s different. That is when ghosts\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no such things as ghosts, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but there are, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know people who\r\nhave seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says\r\nthat his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night\r\nafter he\xe2\x80\x99d been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell a story for anything. She\xe2\x80\x99s a very religious woman. And\r\nMrs. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with\r\nits head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the\r\nspirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine\r\ndays. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but he died two years after, so you see it was really\r\ntrue. And Ruby Gillis says--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Marilla firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI never want to hear you\r\ntalking in this fashion again. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my doubts about that imagination\r\nof yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t countenance any such doings. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go right over to Barry\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to\r\nyou. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very\r\nreal. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce\r\ngrove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She\r\nmarched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her\r\nto proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of\r\nwailing ladies and headless specters beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you\r\nfeel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll risk it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla unfeelingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I always mean what I\r\nsay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne marched. That is, she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering\r\nup the horrible dim path beyond. Anne never forgot that walk. Bitterly\r\ndid she repent the license she had given to her imagination. The goblins\r\nof her fancy lurked in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold,\r\nfleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them\r\ninto being. A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over\r\nthe brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still. The long-drawn\r\nwail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the\r\nperspiration in beads on her forehead. The swoop of bats in the darkness\r\nover her was as the wings of unearthly creatures. When she reached Mr.\r\nWilliam Bell\xe2\x80\x99s field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of\r\nwhite things, and arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath\r\nthat she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern.\r\nDiana was away so that she had no excuse to linger. The dreadful\r\nreturn journey had to be faced. Anne went back over it with shut eyes,\r\npreferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs\r\nto that of seeing a white thing. When she finally stumbled over the log\r\nbridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so nothing caught you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla unsympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mar--Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d chattered Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll b-b-be contt-tented with\r\nc-c-commonplace places after this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. A New Departure in Flavorings\r\n\r\n\r\n|DEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as\r\nMrs. Lynde says,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books\r\ndown on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red\r\neyes with a very damp handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it fortunate, Marilla, that\r\nI took an extra handkerchief to school today? I had a presentiment that\r\nit would be needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you\xe2\x80\x99d require two\r\nhandkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n reflected Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI just cried because all the others did. It was\r\nRuby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr.\r\nPhillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she\r\nburst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.\r\nI tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips\r\nmade me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name\r\nwithout an \xe2\x80\x98e\xe2\x80\x99 on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce\r\nhe ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he\r\nhad been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Marilla, and I\r\njust had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how\r\nglad she\xe2\x80\x99d be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nshed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a\r\nhandkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn\xe2\x80\x99t cry--because\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh,\r\nMarilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful\r\nfarewell speech beginning, \xe2\x80\x98The time has come for us to part.\xe2\x80\x99 It was\r\nvery affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt\r\ndreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I\xe2\x80\x99d talked in school\r\nand drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy.\r\nI can tell you I wished I\xe2\x80\x99d been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from\r\nschool. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, \xe2\x80\x98The time has come\r\nfor us to part,\xe2\x80\x99 and that would start us off again whenever we were in\r\nany danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t feel quite in the depths of despair with two months\xe2\x80\x99 vacation\r\nbefore them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and\r\nhis wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr.\r\nPhillips going away I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help taking a little interest in a new\r\nminister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely,\r\nof course--it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally\r\nlovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the\r\nminister\xe2\x80\x99s wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she\r\ndresses so fashionably. Our new minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife was dressed in blue\r\nmuslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.\r\nJane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for\r\na minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any such uncharitable remark,\r\nMarilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s only been a minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife for a little while, so one should\r\nmake allowances, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde\r\nuntil the manse is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s that evening, was actuated by\r\nany motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had\r\nborrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most\r\nof the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes\r\nnever expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the\r\nborrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,\r\nwas a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement\r\nwhere sensations were few and far between.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in\r\nimagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a\r\nwidower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that\r\ngossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year\r\nof his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and\r\ndeparted amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection\r\nborn of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his\r\nshortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a\r\nvariety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various\r\ncandidates and \xe2\x80\x9csupplies\xe2\x80\x9d who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on\r\ntrial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers\r\nin Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the\r\ncorner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and\r\ndiscussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from\r\nprinciple to criticize ministers in any shape or form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew\xe2\x80\x9d was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s final\r\nsumming up. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his\r\nworst fault was just like Mr. Bentley\xe2\x80\x99s--he had no imagination. And Mr.\r\nTerry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in\r\nthe matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,\r\nbut he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;\r\nhe was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;\r\nbut Mrs. Lynde says he isn\xe2\x80\x99t married, or even engaged, because she made\r\nspecial inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have\r\na young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the\r\ncongregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing\r\nwoman, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she, Matthew? I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad they\xe2\x80\x99ve called Mr. Allan. I\r\nliked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he\r\nmeant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.\r\nMrs. Lynde says he isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,\r\nand anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly\r\non all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife\xe2\x80\x99s people and they\r\nare most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde\r\nsays that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman\r\nmake an ideal combination for a minister\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still\r\non their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for\r\ntheir chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.\r\nOld and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals,\r\nand the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the\r\nmanse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love.\r\nShe had discovered another kindred spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced one Sunday afternoon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s taken our class and she\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid teacher. She said right away\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions,\r\nand you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought. She\r\nsaid we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m good at asking questions, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s emphatic comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was\r\nto be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that was a\r\nvery proper question to ask because it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any connection with the\r\nlesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions\xe2\x80\x99 den--but Mrs. Allan\r\njust smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a\r\nlovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had\r\ndimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99m not half so skinny as I was when I\r\ncame here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence\r\npeople for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence\r\nother people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew\r\nbefore that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it\r\nwas kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan\xe2\x80\x99s isn\xe2\x80\x99t, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be a\r\nChristian if I could be one like her. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be one like Mr.\r\nSuperintendent Bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla\r\nseverely. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bell is a real good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course he\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get any\r\ncomfort out of it. If I could be good I\xe2\x80\x99d dance and sing all day because\r\nI was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and\r\nof course it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be dignified in a minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife. But I can just\r\nfeel she\xe2\x80\x99s glad she\xe2\x80\x99s a Christian and that she\xe2\x80\x99d be one even if she\r\ncould get to heaven without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been most everywhere but here. Let me\r\nsee. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don\xe2\x80\x99t say a\r\nword to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he\xe2\x80\x99d find some\r\nexcuse to be away that day. He\xe2\x80\x99d got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind him, but he\xe2\x80\x99s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new\r\nminister, and a new minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife will frighten him to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be as secret as the dead,\xe2\x80\x9d assured Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cBut oh, Marilla, will\r\nyou let me make a cake for the occasion? I\xe2\x80\x99d love to do something for\r\nMrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can make a layer cake,\xe2\x80\x9d promised Marilla.\r\n\r\nMonday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.\r\nHaving the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important\r\nundertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of\r\nthe Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She\r\ntalked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they\r\nsat on the big red stones by the Dryad\xe2\x80\x99s Bubble and made rainbows in the\r\nwater with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I\xe2\x80\x99m to make in the\r\nmorning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just\r\nbefore teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy\r\ntwo days of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a responsibility having a minister\xe2\x80\x99s family to\r\ntea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see\r\nour pantry. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sight to behold. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have jellied chicken\r\nand cold tongue. We\xe2\x80\x99re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and\r\nwhipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,\r\nand fruit cake, and Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s famous yellow plum preserves that she\r\nkeeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and\r\nbiscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister\r\nis dyspeptic and can\xe2\x80\x99t eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic,\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to\r\nhave had a bad effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer\r\ncake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good! I dreamed last night that\r\nI was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be good, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d assured Diana, who was a very comfortable\r\nsort of friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure that piece of the one you made that we had for\r\nlunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just\r\nwhen you especially want them to be good,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne, setting a\r\nparticularly well-balsamed twig afloat. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I suppose I shall\r\njust have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh,\r\nlook, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come\r\nout after we go away and take it for a scarf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know there is no such thing as a dryad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. Diana\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nhad found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over\r\nit. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights\r\nof imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of\r\nbelief even in harmless dryads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to imagine there is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery night before\r\nI go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really\r\nsitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes\r\nI look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive up your faith in the dryad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too\r\nexcited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of\r\nher dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short\r\nof absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary\r\nmatters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.\r\nWhen she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you\r\nthink it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn\xe2\x80\x99t good? I\r\nused it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of\r\ngetting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.\r\nMrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what\r\nif that cake doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty without it\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s unimpassioned way of\r\nlooking at the subject.\r\n\r\nThe cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and\r\nfeathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together\r\nwith layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it\r\nand possibly asking for another piece!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I\r\nfix the table with ferns and wild roses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\neatables that matter and not flummery decorations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, who was not entirely\r\nguiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, \xe2\x80\x9cand the minister paid her an\r\nelegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the\r\npalate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, who was quite determined not to\r\nbe surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly mind you leave enough\r\nroom for the dishes and the food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that\r\nshould leave Mrs. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns\r\nand a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a\r\nthing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they\r\nexclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Anne\xe2\x80\x99s doings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.\r\nAllan\xe2\x80\x99s approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.\r\n\r\nMatthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness\r\nand Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and\r\nnervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him\r\nin hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes\r\nand white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.\r\nHe never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nAll went merry as a marriage bell until Anne\xe2\x80\x99s layer cake was passed.\r\nMrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,\r\ndeclined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face, said\r\nsmilingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case I must sample it,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to\r\na plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.\r\n\r\nMrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression\r\ncrossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away\r\nat it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat on earth did you put into that\r\ncake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne with a look of\r\nanguish. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right! It\xe2\x80\x99s simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to eat it. Anne,\r\ntaste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting\r\nthe cake. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking\r\npowder. I had my suspicions of that bak--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you\r\nused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially\r\nfilled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, \xe2\x80\x9cBest Vanilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us, Anne, you\xe2\x80\x99ve flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_. I\r\nbroke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an\r\nold empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s partly my fault--I should have\r\nwarned you--but for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have smelled it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t--I had such a cold!\xe2\x80\x9d and with this she fairly fled to the\r\ngable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who\r\nrefuses to be comforted.\r\n\r\nPresently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Anne, without looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disgraced forever.\r\nI shall never be able to live this down. It will get out--things always\r\ndo get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I\r\nshall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the\r\ngirl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil--the boys in school\r\nwill never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark\r\nof Christian pity don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes\r\nafter this. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but\r\nI cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99ll think I\r\ntried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried\r\nto poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn\xe2\x80\x99t poisonous. It\xe2\x80\x99s meant\r\nto be taken internally--although not in cakes. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you tell Mrs. Allan\r\nso, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said a merry voice.\r\n\r\nAnne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with\r\nlaughing eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear little girl, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t cry like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, genuinely\r\ndisturbed by Anne\xe2\x80\x99s tragic face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s all just a funny mistake\r\nthat anybody might make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne forlornly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and\r\nthoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now,\r\nyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower\r\ngarden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I\r\nwant to see it, for I\xe2\x80\x99m very much interested in flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it\r\nwas really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing\r\nmore was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away\r\nAnne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been\r\nexpected, considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no\r\nmistakes in it yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant you\xe2\x80\x99ll make plenty in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw your\r\nbeat for making mistakes, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and well I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Anne mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut have you ever\r\nnoticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same\r\nmistake twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know as that\xe2\x80\x99s much benefit when you\xe2\x80\x99re always making new\r\nones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one\r\nperson can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be through\r\nwith them. That\xe2\x80\x99s a very comforting thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99d better go and give that cake to the pigs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t fit for any human to eat, not even Jerry Boute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. Anne is Invited Out to Tea\r\n\r\n\r\n|AND what are your eyes popping out of your head about. Now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMarilla, when Anne had just come in from a run to the post office. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou discovered another kindred spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d Excitement hung around Anne like\r\na garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature. She had come\r\ndancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow\r\nsunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the\r\nmanse tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post\r\noffice. Just look at it, Marilla. \xe2\x80\x98Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThat is the first time I was ever called \xe2\x80\x98Miss.\xe2\x80\x99 Such a thrill as it\r\ngave me! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Allan told me she meant to have all the members of her\r\nSunday-school class to tea in turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, regarding the\r\nwonderful event very coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t get in such a fever over it.\r\nDo learn to take things calmly, child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature. All\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspirit and fire and dew,\xe2\x80\x9d as she was, the pleasures and pains of life\r\ncame to her with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely\r\ntroubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would\r\nprobably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently\r\nunderstanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more\r\nthan compensate. Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill\r\nAnne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien\r\nto her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows. She did not\r\nmake much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted to herself. The downfall\r\nof some dear hope or plan plunged Anne into \xe2\x80\x9cdeeps of affliction.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight. Marilla had\r\nalmost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into\r\nher model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment. Neither\r\nwould she have believed that she really liked Anne much better as she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nAnne went to bed that night speechless with misery because Matthew had\r\nsaid the wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day\r\ntomorrow. The rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her,\r\nit sounded so like pattering raindrops, and the full, faraway roar of\r\nthe gulf, to which she listened delightedly at other times, loving its\r\nstrange, sonorous, haunting rhythm, now seemed like a prophecy of storm\r\nand disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day. Anne\r\nthought that the morning would never come.\r\n\r\nBut all things have an end, even nights before the day on which you are\r\ninvited to take tea at the manse. The morning, in spite of Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npredictions, was fine and Anne\xe2\x80\x99s spirits soared to their highest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, there is something in me today that makes me just love\r\neverybody I see,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how good I feel! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be nice if it could last? I\r\nbelieve I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every\r\nday. But oh, Marilla, it\xe2\x80\x99s a solemn occasion too. I feel so anxious.\r\nWhat if I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t behave properly? You know I never had tea at a\r\nmanse before, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I know all the rules of etiquette,\r\nalthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying the rules given in the Etiquette Department\r\nof the Family Herald ever since I came here. I\xe2\x80\x99m so afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nsomething silly or forget to do something I should do. Would it be\r\ngood manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _very_\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trouble with you, Anne, is that you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking too much about\r\nyourself. You should just think of Mrs. Allan and what would be nicest\r\nand most agreeable to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, hitting for once in her life\r\non a very sound and pithy piece of advice. Anne instantly realized this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try not to think about myself at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cetiquette,\xe2\x80\x9d for she came home through the twilight, under a great,\r\nhigh-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in\r\na beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting\r\non the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly\r\nhead in Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s gingham lap.\r\n\r\nA cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims\r\nof firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star\r\nhung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them\r\nas she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were\r\nall tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not\r\nlived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never\r\nbe invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me\r\nat the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy,\r\nwith dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a\r\nseraph. I really think I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be a minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife when I grow up,\r\nMarilla. A minister mightn\xe2\x80\x99t mind my red hair because he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nthinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to\r\nbe naturally good and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never be that, so I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in\r\nthinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others\r\nare not. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I\xe2\x80\x99m full of original\r\nsin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success\r\nof it as those who are naturally good. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal like geometry,\r\nI expect. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think the trying so hard ought to count for\r\nsomething? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her\r\npassionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs.\r\nAllan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are\r\nothers, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You\r\nknow you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such\r\nactive workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of\r\nit all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the\r\nmanse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette\r\nBradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred\r\nspirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I\r\nthink I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs.\r\nAllan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too.\r\nMrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the\r\nSunday-school choir after this. You can\xe2\x80\x99t think how I was thrilled at\r\nthe mere thought. I\xe2\x80\x99ve longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir,\r\nas Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.\r\nLauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the\r\nWhite Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta\r\nsays that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in\r\naid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White\r\nSands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself\r\nsomeday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I\r\nhad a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and\r\nthe twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and\r\nmy troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs.\r\nAllan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that\r\nencouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what\r\ndo you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a romantic name? Mrs.\r\nLynde says they\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she\r\nthinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid\r\nto have a lady teacher, and I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I\xe2\x80\x99m going to live\r\nthrough the two weeks before school begins. I\xe2\x80\x99m so impatient to see\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. Anne Comes to Grief in an Affair of Honor\r\n\r\n\r\n|ANNE had to live through more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a\r\nmonth having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time\r\nfor her to get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as\r\nabsentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls\r\nin the pantry instead of into the pigs\xe2\x80\x99 bucket, and walking clean over\r\nthe edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative\r\nreverie, not really being worth counting.\r\n\r\nA week after the tea at the manse Diana Barry gave a party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall and select,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne assured Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cJust the girls in our class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea,\r\nwhen they found themselves in the Barry garden, a little tired of all\r\ntheir games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might\r\npresent itself. This presently took the form of \xe2\x80\x9cdaring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just\r\nthen. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all\r\nthe silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers\r\nthereof were \xe2\x80\x9cdared\xe2\x80\x9d to do them would fill a book by themselves.\r\n\r\nFirst of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point\r\nin the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis,\r\nalbeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said\r\ntree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she\r\nshould tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the\r\naforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her\r\nleft leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right\r\nfoot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out\r\nat the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.\r\n\r\nJosie\xe2\x80\x99s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,\r\nAnne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which\r\nbounded the garden to the east. Now, to \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\xe2\x80\x9d board fences requires\r\nmore skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who\r\nhas never tried it. But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities\r\nthat make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly\r\ncultivated, for walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with\r\nan airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth a \xe2\x80\x9cdare.\xe2\x80\x9d Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for\r\nmost of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things\r\nthemselves in their efforts to walk fences. Josie descended from her\r\nperch, flushed with victory, and darted a defiant glance at Anne.\r\n\r\nAnne tossed her red braids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s such a very wonderful thing to walk a little, low,\r\nboard fence,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the\r\nridgepole of a roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Josie flatly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe anybody could\r\nwalk a ridgepole. _You_ couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne rashly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I dare you to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Josie defiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare you to climb\r\nup there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. She\r\nwalked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen\r\nroof. All the fifth-class girls said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d partly in excitement, partly\r\nin dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you do it, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll fall off and be\r\nkilled. Never mind Josie Pye. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to dare anybody to do\r\nanything so dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do it. My honor is at stake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall walk\r\nthat ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt. If I am killed you are\r\nto have my pearl bead ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole,\r\nbalanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to\r\nwalk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up\r\nin the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your\r\nimagination helped you out much. Nevertheless, she managed to take\r\nseveral steps before the catastrophe came. Then she swayed, lost her\r\nbalance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked\r\nroof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper\r\nbeneath--all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous,\r\nterrified shriek.\r\n\r\nIf Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended\r\nDiana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and\r\nthere. Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended\r\ndown over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was\r\na much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other\r\ngirls had rushed frantically around the house--except Ruby Gillis, who\r\nremained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics--they found\r\nAnne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia\r\ncreeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, are you killed?\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees\r\nbeside her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and\r\ntell me if you\xe2\x80\x99re killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye,\r\nwho, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible\r\nvisions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne\r\nShirley\xe2\x80\x99s early and tragic death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered\r\nuncertainly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Carrie Sloane. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, where, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d Before Anne could\r\nanswer Mrs. Barry appeared on the scene. At sight of her Anne tried to\r\nscramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of\r\npain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mrs. Barry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ankle,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana, please find your father and ask him\r\nto take me home. I know I can never walk there. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhop so far on one foot when Jane couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even hop around the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when\r\nshe saw Mr. Barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with Mrs.\r\nBarry beside him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after\r\nhim. In his arms he carried Anne, whose head lay limply against his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Marilla had a revelation. In the sudden stab of fear that\r\npierced her very heart she realized what Anne had come to mean to her.\r\nShe would have admitted that she liked Anne--nay, that she was very fond\r\nof Anne. But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that Anne\r\nwas dearer to her than anything else on earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Barry, what has happened to her?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, more white and shaken\r\nthan the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years.\r\n\r\nAnne herself answered, lifting her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be very frightened, Marilla. I was walking the ridgepole and I\r\nfell off. I expect I have sprained my ankle. But, Marilla, I might have\r\nbroken my neck. Let us look on the bright side of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have known you\xe2\x80\x99d go and do something of the sort when I let you\r\ngo to that party,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, sharp and shrewish in her very relief.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring her in here, Mr. Barry, and lay her on the sofa. Mercy me, the\r\nchild has gone and fainted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite true. Overcome by the pain of her injury, Anne had one more\r\nof her wishes granted to her. She had fainted dead away.\r\n\r\nMatthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway\r\ndispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the\r\ninjury was more serious than they had supposed. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s ankle was broken.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced\r\ngirl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you very sorry for me, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was your own fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, twitching down the blind and\r\nlighting a lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is just why you should be sorry for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nthe thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I\r\ncould blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would\r\nyou have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. Such\r\nabsurdity!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla.\r\n\r\nAnne sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I just felt\r\nthat I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear Josie Pye\xe2\x80\x99s scorn. She would have crowed over me\r\nall my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe very cross with me, Marilla. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a bit nice to faint, after all.\r\nAnd the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe able to go around for six or seven weeks and I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the new lady\r\nteacher. She won\xe2\x80\x99t be new any more by the time I\xe2\x80\x99m able to go to school.\r\nAnd Gil--everybody will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted\r\nmortal. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to bear it all bravely if only you won\xe2\x80\x99t be cross\r\nwith me, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, I\xe2\x80\x99m not cross,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re an unlucky child,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that; but as you say, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the suffering\r\nof it. Here now, try and eat some supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it fortunate I\xe2\x80\x99ve got such an imagination?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\r\nhelp me through splendidly, I expect. What do people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nimagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during\r\nthe tedious seven weeks that followed. But she was not solely dependent\r\non it. She had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of\r\nthe schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her\r\nall the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody has been so good and kind, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne happily,\r\non the day when she could first limp across the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\npleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, Marilla. You\r\nfind out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came\r\nto see me, and he\xe2\x80\x99s really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of\r\ncourse; but still I like him and I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry I ever criticized his\r\nprayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into\r\nthe habit of saying them as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He could get over that if he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntake a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard\r\nI tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me\r\nall about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem\r\nso strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my\r\nimagination has its limits, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine _that_. When I try to\r\nimagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just\r\nas he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to imagine\r\nMrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen\r\ntimes. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to\r\nhave visit you, too. She never tells you it\xe2\x80\x99s your own fault and she\r\nhopes you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told\r\nme that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that\r\nmade me feel she might hope I\xe2\x80\x99d be a better girl but didn\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\nbelieve I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as\r\npolitely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk\r\na ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden\r\nof remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nover every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad\r\nwhen I can go to school for I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard such exciting things about the\r\nnew teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she\r\nhas the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses\r\nbeautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nAvonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody\r\nhas to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just glorious to\r\nthink of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie\r\nhas so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are\r\npreparing a dialogue, called \xe2\x80\x98A Morning Visit,\xe2\x80\x99 for next Friday. And the\r\nFriday afternoons they don\xe2\x80\x99t have recitations Miss Stacy takes them\r\nall to the woods for a \xe2\x80\x98field\xe2\x80\x99 day and they study ferns and flowers\r\nand birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and\r\nevening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all\r\ncomes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I\r\nbelieve I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing plain to be seen, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is\r\nthat your fall off the Barry roof hasn\xe2\x80\x99t injured your tongue at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. Miss Stacy and Her Pupils Get Up a Concert\r\n\r\n\r\n|IT was October again when Anne was ready to go back to school--a\r\nglorious October, all red and gold, with mellow mornings when the\r\nvalleys were filled with delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had\r\npoured them in for the sun to drain--amethyst, pearl, silver, rose, and\r\nsmoke-blue. The dews were so heavy that the fields glistened like cloth\r\nof silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of\r\nmany-stemmed woods to run crisply through. The Birch Path was a canopy\r\nof yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it. There was a\r\ntang in the very air that inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping,\r\nunlike snails, swiftly and willingly to school; and it _was_ jolly to\r\nbe back again at the little brown desk beside Diana, with Ruby Gillis\r\nnodding across the aisle and Carrie Sloane sending up notes and Julia\r\nBell passing a \xe2\x80\x9cchew\xe2\x80\x9d of gum down from the back seat. Anne drew a long\r\nbreath of happiness as she sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture\r\ncards in her desk. Life was certainly very interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend. Miss Stacy\r\nwas a bright, sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and\r\nholding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was\r\nin them mentally and morally. Anne expanded like a flower under this\r\nwholesome influence and carried home to the admiring Matthew and the\r\ncritical Marilla glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love Miss Stacy with my whole heart, Marilla. She is so ladylike\r\nand she has such a sweet voice. When she pronounces my name I feel\r\n_instinctively_ that she\xe2\x80\x99s spelling it with an E. We had recitations\r\nthis afternoon. I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary, Queen of Scots.\xe2\x80\x99 I just put my whole soul into it. Ruby Gillis\r\ntold me coming home that the way I said the line, \xe2\x80\x98Now for my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98my woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart farewell,\xe2\x80\x99 just made her blood run\r\ncold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, you might recite it for me some of these days, out in the\r\nbarn,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne meditatively, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do\r\nit so well, I know. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be so exciting as it is when you have a\r\nwhole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words. I know I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make your blood run cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lynde says it made _her_ blood run cold to see the boys climbing to\r\nthe very tops of those big trees on Bell\xe2\x80\x99s hill after crows\xe2\x80\x99 nests last\r\nFriday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder at Miss Stacy for encouraging it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we wanted a crow\xe2\x80\x99s nest for nature study,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nwas on our field afternoon. Field afternoons are splendid, Marilla.\r\nAnd Miss Stacy explains everything so beautifully. We have to write\r\ncompositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very vain of you to say so then. You\xe2\x80\x99d better let your teacher say\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she _did_ say it, Marilla. And indeed I\xe2\x80\x99m not vain about it. How can\r\nI be, when I\xe2\x80\x99m such a dunce at geometry? Although I\xe2\x80\x99m really beginning\r\nto see through it a little, too. Miss Stacy makes it so clear. Still,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection.\r\nBut I love writing compositions. Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose\r\nour own subjects; but next week we are to write a composition on some\r\nremarkable person. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to choose among so many remarkable people\r\nwho have lived. Mustn\xe2\x80\x99t it be splendid to be remarkable and have\r\ncompositions written about you after you\xe2\x80\x99re dead? Oh, I would dearly\r\nlove to be remarkable. I think when I grow up I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a trained nurse\r\nand go with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of\r\nmercy. That is, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t go out as a foreign missionary. That would\r\nbe very romantic, but one would have to be very good to be a missionary,\r\nand that would be a stumbling block. We have physical culture exercises\r\nevery day, too. They make you graceful and promote digestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromote fiddlesticks!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, who honestly thought it was all\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\nBut all the field afternoons and recitation Fridays and physical culture\r\ncontortions paled before a project which Miss Stacy brought forward in\r\nNovember. This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up\r\na concert and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night, for the laudable\r\npurpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag. The pupils one and\r\nall taking graciously to this plan, the preparations for a program\r\nwere begun at once. And of all the excited performers-elect none was so\r\nexcited as Anne Shirley, who threw herself into the undertaking heart\r\nand soul, hampered as she was by Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval. Marilla thought\r\nit all rank foolishness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that\r\nought to be put on your lessons,\xe2\x80\x9d she grumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s getting up concerts and racing about to practices. It makes\r\nthem vain and forward and fond of gadding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think of the worthy object,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cA flag will cultivate a\r\nspirit of patriotism, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFudge! There\xe2\x80\x99s precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of\r\nyou. All you want is a good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all right? Of\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s real nice to be getting up a concert. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have\r\nsix choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I\xe2\x80\x99m in two dialogues--\xe2\x80\x98The\r\nSociety for the Suppression of Gossip\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98The Fairy Queen.\xe2\x80\x99 The boys\r\nare going to have a dialogue too. And I\xe2\x80\x99m to have two recitations,\r\nMarilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice thrilly kind\r\nof tremble. And we\xe2\x80\x99re to have a tableau at the last--\xe2\x80\x98Faith, Hope and\r\nCharity.\xe2\x80\x99 Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with\r\nflowing hair. I\xe2\x80\x99m to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes\r\nuplifted. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nalarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one\r\nof them, and it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla.\r\nJosie Pye is sulky because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the part she wanted in\r\nthe dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been\r\nridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy\r\nqueens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be\r\none of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is\r\njust as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie\r\nsays. I\xe2\x80\x99m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis\r\nis going to lend me her slippers because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any of my own. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnecessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine\r\na fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are\r\ngoing to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with\r\npink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two\r\nafter the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the\r\norgan. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am,\r\nbut don\xe2\x80\x99t you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I hope is that you\xe2\x80\x99ll behave yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be heartily glad when\r\nall this fuss is over and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to settle down. You are simply\r\ngood for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and\r\ngroans and tableaus. As for your tongue, it\xe2\x80\x99s a marvel it\xe2\x80\x99s not clean\r\nworn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sighed and betook herself to the back yard, over which a young new\r\nmoon was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple-green\r\nwestern sky, and where Matthew was splitting wood. Anne perched herself\r\non a block and talked the concert over with him, sure of an appreciative\r\nand sympathetic listener in this instance at least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a pretty good concert. And I\r\nexpect you\xe2\x80\x99ll do your part fine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling down into her eager,\r\nvivacious little face. Anne smiled back at him. Those two were the best\r\nof friends and Matthew thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had\r\nnothing to do with bringing her up. That was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive duty;\r\nif it had been his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts\r\nbetween inclination and said duty. As it was, he was free to, \xe2\x80\x9cspoil\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x9d--Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s phrasing--as much as he liked. But it was not such a\r\nbad arrangement after all; a little \xe2\x80\x9cappreciation\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes does quite\r\nas much good as all the conscientious \xe2\x80\x9cbringing up\xe2\x80\x9d in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. Matthew Insists on Puffed Sleeves\r\n\r\n\r\n|MATTHEW was having a bad ten minutes of it. He had come into the\r\nkitchen, in the twilight of a cold, gray December evening, and had sat\r\ndown in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots, unconscious of\r\nthe fact that Anne and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fairy Queen\xe2\x80\x9d in the sitting room. Presently they came trooping\r\nthrough the hall and out into the kitchen, laughing and chattering\r\ngaily. They did not see Matthew, who shrank bashfully back into the\r\nshadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the\r\nother, and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they\r\nput on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert.\r\nAnne stood among them, bright eyed and animated as they; but Matthew\r\nsuddenly became conscious that there was something about her different\r\nfrom her mates. And what worried Matthew was that the difference\r\nimpressed him as being something that should not exist. Anne had a\r\nbrighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features\r\nthan the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note\r\nof these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist\r\nin any of these respects. Then in what did it consist?\r\n\r\nMatthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm\r\nin arm, down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself\r\nto her books. He could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be\r\nquite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she\r\nsaw between Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their\r\ntongues quiet while Anne never did. This, Matthew felt, would be no\r\ngreat help.\r\n\r\nHe had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out, much\r\nto Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard reflection\r\nMatthew arrived at a solution of his problem. Anne was not dressed like\r\nthe other girls!\r\n\r\nThe more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that\r\nAnne never had been dressed like the other girls--never since she had\r\ncome to Green Gables. Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark dresses,\r\nall made after the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew there was\r\nsuch a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did; but he was\r\nquite sure that Anne\xe2\x80\x99s sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the\r\nother girls wore. He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen\r\naround her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink\r\nand white--and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and\r\nsoberly gowned.\r\n\r\nOf course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was\r\nbringing her up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served\r\nthereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty\r\ndress--something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that\r\nhe would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an\r\nunwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off.\r\nA nice new dress would be the very thing for a present. Matthew, with a\r\nsigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while Marilla\r\nopened all the doors and aired the house.\r\n\r\nThe very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the\r\ndress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It would\r\nbe, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew\r\ncould buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be\r\nat the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\r\n\r\nAfter much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s store\r\ninstead of William Blair\xe2\x80\x99s. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to\r\nWilliam Blair\xe2\x80\x99s; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them\r\nas to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William\r\nBlair\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew\r\nheld them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he\r\nknew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter\r\nas this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he\r\nmust be sure of a man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawson\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwhere Samuel or his son would wait on him.\r\n\r\nAlas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his\r\nbusiness, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour,\r\nbig, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She\r\nwas dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets\r\nthat glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands.\r\nMatthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and\r\nthose bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Lucilla Harris\r\ninquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered\r\nMatthew.\r\n\r\nMiss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man\r\ninquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe we have one or two left over,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nupstairs in the lumber room. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d During her absence\r\nMatthew collected his scattered senses for another effort.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?\xe2\x80\x9d Matthew took his courage in\r\nboth hands and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell now, since you suggest it, I might as\r\nwell--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She now concluded\r\nthat he was entirely crazy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe only keep hayseed in the spring,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained loftily. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve none\r\non hand just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly--certainly--just as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered unhappy\r\nMatthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he\r\nrecollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.\r\nWhile Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for\r\na final desperate attempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now--if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too much trouble--I might as well--that is--I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike to look at--at--some sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhite or brown?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Miss Harris patiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--well now--brown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a barrel of it over there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Harris, shaking her\r\nbangles at it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only kind we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll--I\xe2\x80\x99ll take twenty pounds of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, with beads of\r\nperspiration standing on his forehead.\r\n\r\nMatthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again. It had\r\nbeen a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for\r\ncommitting the heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached\r\nhome he hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he carried in to\r\nMarilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrown sugar!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever possessed you to get so\r\nmuch? You know I never use it except for the hired man\xe2\x80\x99s porridge or\r\nblack fruit cake. Jerry\xe2\x80\x99s gone and I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my cake long ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\ngood sugar, either--it\xe2\x80\x99s coarse and dark--William Blair doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually\r\nkeep sugar like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I thought it might come in handy sometime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, making\r\ngood his escape.\r\n\r\nWhen Matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was\r\nrequired to cope with the situation. Marilla was out of the question.\r\nMatthew felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once.\r\nRemained only Mrs. Lynde; for of no other woman in Avonlea would Matthew\r\nhave dared to ask advice. To Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly, and that\r\ngood lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPick out a dress for you to give Anne? To be sure I will. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nCarmody tomorrow and I\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to it. Have you something particular in\r\nmind? No? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go by my own judgment then. I believe a nice\r\nrich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria\r\nin that\xe2\x80\x99s real pretty. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to make it up for her, too,\r\nseeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it\r\nbefore the time and spoil the surprise? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. No, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na mite of trouble. I like sewing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it to fit my niece, Jenny\r\nGillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, \xe2\x80\x9cand--and--I dunno--but I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike--I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used\r\nto be. If it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be asking too much I--I\xe2\x80\x99d like them made in the\r\nnew way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPuffs? Of course. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t worry a speck more about it, Matthew.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make it up in the very latest fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Lynde. To herself\r\nshe added when Matthew had gone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something\r\ndecent for once. The way Marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nheld my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want advice and she\r\nthinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s an old maid. But that\xe2\x80\x99s always the way. Folks that has brought up\r\nchildren know that there\xe2\x80\x99s no hard and fast method in the world that\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsuit every child. But them as never have think it\xe2\x80\x99s all as plain and\r\neasy as Rule of Three--just set your three terms down so fashion, and\r\nthe sum \xe2\x80\x98ll work out correct. But flesh and blood don\xe2\x80\x99t come under the\r\nhead of arithmetic and that\xe2\x80\x99s where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake.\r\nI suppose she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by\r\ndressing her as she does; but it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to cultivate envy and\r\ndiscontent. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the child must feel the difference between her\r\nclothes and the other girls\xe2\x80\x99. But to think of Matthew taking notice of\r\nit! That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla knew all the following fortnight that Matthew had something on\r\nhis mind, but what it was she could not guess, until Christmas Eve, when\r\nMrs. Lynde brought up the new dress. Marilla behaved pretty well on the\r\nwhole, although it is very likely she distrusted Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic\r\nexplanation that she had made the dress because Matthew was afraid Anne\r\nwould find out about it too soon if Marilla made it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and\r\ngrinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said a little\r\nstiffly but tolerantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew he was up to some foolishness. Well, I\r\nmust say I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three\r\ngood, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer\r\nextravagance. There\xe2\x80\x99s enough material in those sleeves alone to make a\r\nwaist, I declare there is. You\xe2\x80\x99ll just pamper Anne\xe2\x80\x99s vanity, Matthew,\r\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope she\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied\r\nat last, for I know she\xe2\x80\x99s been hankering after those silly sleeves ever\r\nsince they came in, although she never said a word after the first. The\r\npuffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along; they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nas big as balloons now. Next year anybody who wears them will have to go\r\nthrough a door sideways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very\r\nmild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but\r\njust enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne\r\npeeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs\r\nin the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches\r\nand wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were\r\nstretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that\r\nwas glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed\r\nthrough Green Gables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a lovely\r\nChristmas? I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad it\xe2\x80\x99s white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem real, does it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like green Christmases. They\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\ngreen--they\xe2\x80\x99re just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call\r\nthem green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and\r\nheld it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be\r\ncontemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene\r\nout of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.\r\n\r\nAnne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty\r\nit was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt\r\nwith dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the\r\nmost fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.\r\nBut the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and\r\nabove them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of\r\nbrown-silk ribbon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a Christmas present for you, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew shyly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--why--Anne, don\xe2\x80\x99t you like it? Well now--well now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had suddenly filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike it! Oh, Matthew!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped\r\nher hands. \xe2\x80\x9cMatthew, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you\r\nenough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy\r\ndream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, let us have breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI must say,\r\nAnne, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it\r\nfor you, see that you take good care of it. There\xe2\x80\x99s a hair ribbon Mrs.\r\nLynde left for you. It\xe2\x80\x99s brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how I\xe2\x80\x99m going to eat breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne rapturously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nfeast my eyes on that dress. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad that puffed sleeves are still\r\nfashionable. It did seem to me that I\xe2\x80\x99d never get over it if they went\r\nout before I had a dress with them. I\xe2\x80\x99d never have felt quite satisfied,\r\nyou see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel\r\nthat I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It\xe2\x80\x99s at times like this I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry I\xe2\x80\x99m not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will\r\nbe in future. But somehow it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to carry out your resolutions when\r\nirresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort\r\nafter this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the\r\nwhite log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson\r\nulster. Anne flew down the slope to meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas, Diana! And oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful Christmas. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nsomething splendid to show you. Matthew has given me the loveliest\r\ndress, with _such_ sleeves. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine any nicer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got something more for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere--this\r\nbox. Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in\r\nit--and this is for you. I\xe2\x80\x99d have brought it over last night, but it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t come until after dark, and I never feel very comfortable coming\r\nthrough the Haunted Wood in the dark now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne opened the box and peeped in. First a card with \xe2\x80\x9cFor the Anne-girl\r\nand Merry Christmas,\xe2\x80\x9d written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest\r\nlittle kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening\r\nbuckles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cDiana, this is too much. I must be dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call it providential,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t have to borrow Ruby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslippers now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a blessing, for they\xe2\x80\x99re two sizes too big for\r\nyou, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling. Josie Pye would\r\nbe delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the\r\npractice night before last. Did you ever hear anything equal to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the\r\nhall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.\r\n\r\nThe concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success. The\r\nlittle hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but\r\nAnne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in\r\nthe shape of Josie Pye, dared not deny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it been a brilliant evening?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne, when it was all\r\nover and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything went off very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana practically. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess we\r\nmust have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to\r\nsend an account of it to the Charlottetown papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to\r\nthink of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder than\r\nyou did when it was encored. I just said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98It is my dear bosom\r\nfriend who is so honored.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one\r\nwas simply splendid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really\r\ncannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million\r\neyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I\r\nwas sure I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed\r\nsleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves,\r\nDiana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so\r\nfar away. I just felt like a parrot. It\xe2\x80\x99s providential that I practiced\r\nthose recitations so often up in the garret, or I\xe2\x80\x99d never have been able\r\nto get through. Did I groan all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, you groaned lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d assured Diana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was\r\nsplendid to think I had touched somebody\xe2\x80\x99s heart. It\xe2\x80\x99s so romantic\r\nto take part in a concert, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a very memorable\r\noccasion indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t the boys\xe2\x80\x99 dialogue fine?\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cGilbert Blythe was just\r\nsplendid. Anne, I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s awful mean the way you treat Gil. Wait\r\ntill I tell you. When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue\r\none of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil pick it up and put\r\nit in his breast pocket. There now. You\xe2\x80\x99re so romantic that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\r\nought to be pleased at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to me what that person does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne loftily. \xe2\x80\x9cI simply\r\nnever waste a thought on him, Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the\r\nfirst time in twenty years, sat for a while by the kitchen fire after\r\nAnne had gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew\r\nproudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she did,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a bright child, Matthew. And\r\nshe looked real nice too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been kind of opposed to this concert\r\nscheme, but I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s no real harm in it after all. Anyhow, I\r\nwas proud of Anne tonight, although I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell her so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I was proud of her and I did tell her so \xe2\x80\x98fore she went\r\nupstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must see what we can do for her some of\r\nthese days, Marilla. I guess she\xe2\x80\x99ll need something more than Avonlea\r\nschool by and by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s time enough to think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthirteen in March. Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a\r\nbig girl. Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it makes Anne\r\nlook so tall. She\xe2\x80\x99s quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do\r\nfor her will be to send her to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s after a spell. But nothing need\r\nbe said about that for a year or two yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, it\xe2\x80\x99ll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMatthew. \xe2\x80\x9cThings like that are all the better for lots of thinking\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. The Story Club Is Formed\r\n\r\n\r\n|JUNIOR Avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence\r\nagain. To Anne in particular things seemed fearfully flat, stale, and\r\nunprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for\r\nweeks. Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway\r\ndays before the concert? At first, as she told Diana, she did not really\r\nthink she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m positively certain, Diana, that life can never be quite the\r\nsame again as it was in those olden days,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mournfully, as if\r\nreferring to a period of at least fifty years back. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps after a\r\nwhile I\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid concerts spoil people for\r\neveryday life. I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them.\r\nMarilla is such a sensible woman. It must be a great deal better to be\r\nsensible; but still, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99d really want to be a sensible\r\nperson, because they are so unromantic. Mrs. Lynde says there is no\r\ndanger of my ever being one, but you can never tell. I feel just now\r\nthat I may grow up to be sensible yet. But perhaps that is only because\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m tired. I simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep last night for ever so long. I just\r\nlay awake and imagined the concert over and over again. That\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nsplendid thing about such affairs--it\xe2\x80\x99s so lovely to look back to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEventually, however, Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove\r\nand took up its old interests. To be sure, the concert left traces. Ruby\r\nGillis and Emma White, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in\r\ntheir platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising\r\nfriendship of three years was broken up. Josie Pye and Julia Bell did\r\nnot \xe2\x80\x9cspeak\xe2\x80\x9d for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright\r\nthat Julia Bell\xe2\x80\x99s bow when she got up to recite made her think of a\r\nchicken jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia. None of the Sloanes\r\nwould have any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared\r\nthat the Sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the Sloanes had\r\nretorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to\r\ndo properly. Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson,\r\nbecause Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on airs about\r\nher recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was \xe2\x80\x9clicked\xe2\x80\x9d; consequently Moody\r\nSpurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Ella May, would not \xe2\x80\x9cspeak\xe2\x80\x9d to Anne Shirley all the\r\nrest of the winter. With the exception of these trifling frictions, work\r\nin Miss Stacy\xe2\x80\x99s little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.\r\n\r\nThe winter weeks slipped by. It was an unusually mild winter, with so\r\nlittle snow that Anne and Diana could go to school nearly every day by\r\nway of the Birch Path. On Anne\xe2\x80\x99s birthday they were tripping lightly\r\ndown it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss\r\nStacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nWinter\xe2\x80\x99s Walk in the Woods,\xe2\x80\x9d and it behooved them to be observant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think, Diana, I\xe2\x80\x99m thirteen years old today,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Anne in an\r\nawed voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI can scarcely realize that I\xe2\x80\x99m in my teens. When I woke\r\nthis morning it seemed to me that everything must be different. You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem such a novelty\r\nto you as it does to me. It makes life seem so much more interesting.\r\nIn two more years I\xe2\x80\x99ll be really grown up. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great comfort to think\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to use big words then without being laughed at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she\xe2\x80\x99s fifteen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Diana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne disdainfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a\r\ntake-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that is an\r\nuncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable\r\nspeeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? I\r\nsimply can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech,\r\nso I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to\r\nbe as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she\xe2\x80\x99s perfect.\r\nMr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she\r\ntreads on and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really think it right for a minister to\r\nset his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even\r\nministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody\r\nelse. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting\r\nsins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it\xe2\x80\x99s proper\r\nto talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is\r\nimagining too much and forgetting my duties. I\xe2\x80\x99m striving very hard\r\nto overcome it and now that I\xe2\x80\x99m really thirteen perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll get on\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn four more years we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to put our hair up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous. I shall wait until I\xe2\x80\x99m seventeen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had Alice Bell\xe2\x80\x99s crooked nose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne decidedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t--but there! I won\xe2\x80\x99t say what I was going to because it was\r\nextremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s vanity. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I\r\nheard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to\r\nme. Oh, Diana, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a rabbit. That\xe2\x80\x99s something to remember for\r\nour woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in\r\nwinter as in summer. They\xe2\x80\x99re so white and still, as if they were asleep\r\nand dreaming pretty dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t mind writing that composition when its time comes,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed\r\nDiana. \xe2\x80\x9cI can manage to write about the woods, but the one we\xe2\x80\x99re to\r\nhand in Monday is terrible. The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a\r\nstory out of our own heads!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s as easy as wink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy for you because you have an imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Diana,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose you\r\nhave your composition all done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing\r\nmiserably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote it last Monday evening. It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x98The Jealous Rival; or In\r\nDeath Not Divided.\xe2\x80\x99 I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and\r\nnonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is\r\nthe kind of critic I like. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad, sweet story. I just cried like\r\na child while I was writing it. It\xe2\x80\x99s about two beautiful maidens called\r\nCordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village\r\nand were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette\r\nwith a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was\r\na queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw anybody with purple eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the\r\ncommon. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve found out what an\r\nalabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You\r\nknow so much more than you did when you were only twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Diana, who was\r\nbeginning to feel rather interested in their fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram\r\nDeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair\r\nGeraldine. He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a\r\ncarriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three\r\nmiles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found\r\nit rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to\r\ngo by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed\r\nbecause I thought she\xe2\x80\x99d likely be an authority on the subject, having so\r\nmany sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when\r\nMalcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan\r\nthat his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, \xe2\x80\x98What\r\ndo you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?\xe2\x80\x99 And Susan said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--no--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--let me see\xe2\x80\x99--and there they were, engaged as\r\nquick as that. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that sort of a proposal was a very\r\nromantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could.\r\nI made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees,\r\nalthough Ruby Gillis says it isn\xe2\x80\x99t done nowadays. Geraldine accepted\r\nhim in a speech a page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble\r\nwith that speech. I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my\r\nmasterpiece. Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace\r\nand told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he was\r\nimmensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their\r\npath. Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when\r\nGeraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious,\r\nespecially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring. All her\r\naffection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she\r\nshould never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be Geraldine\xe2\x80\x99s friend\r\nthe same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over a\r\nrushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed\r\nGeraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, \xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha, ha.\xe2\x80\x99 But Bertram\r\nsaw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill save thee, my peerless Geraldine.\xe2\x80\x99 But alas, he had forgotten he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\nTheir bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the\r\none grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much\r\nmore romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for\r\nCordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic\r\nasylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow perfectly lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Diana, who belonged to Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s school\r\nof critics. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you can make up such thrilling things out\r\nof your own head, Anne. I wish my imagination was as good as yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be if you\xe2\x80\x99d only cultivate it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne cheeringly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\njust thought of a plan, Diana. Let you and me have a story club all our\r\nown and write stories for practice. I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you along until you can\r\ndo them by yourself. You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know.\r\nMiss Stacy says so. Only we must take the right way. I told her about\r\nthe Haunted Wood, but she said we went the wrong way about it in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was how the story club came into existence. It was limited to Diana\r\nand Anne at first, but soon it was extended to include Jane Andrews\r\nand Ruby Gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations\r\nneeded cultivating. No boys were allowed in it--although Ruby Gillis\r\nopined that their admission would make it more exciting--and each member\r\nhad to produce one story a week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extremely interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne told Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cEach girl has to read\r\nher story out loud and then we talk it over. We are going to keep them\r\nall sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. We each write\r\nunder a nom-de-plume. Mine is Rosamond Montmorency. All the girls\r\ndo pretty well. Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental. She puts too much\r\nlovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too\r\nlittle. Jane never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly\r\nwhen she had to read it out loud. Jane\xe2\x80\x99s stories are extremely sensible.\r\nThen Diana puts too many murders into hers. She says most of the time\r\nshe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get\r\nrid of them. I mostly always have to tell them what to write about, but\r\nthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard for I\xe2\x80\x99ve millions of ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet,\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed\r\nMarilla. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time\r\nthat should be put on your lessons. Reading stories is bad enough but\r\nwriting them is worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re so careful to put a moral into them all, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\r\nAnne. \xe2\x80\x9cI insist upon that. All the good people are rewarded and all\r\nthe bad ones are suitably punished. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that must have a wholesome\r\neffect. The moral is the great thing. Mr. Allan says so. I read one of\r\nmy stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was\r\nexcellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when\r\npeople cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic\r\nparts. Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt\r\nJosephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. So\r\nwe copied out four of our very best and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry\r\nwrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. That\r\nkind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost\r\neverybody died. But I\xe2\x80\x99m glad Miss Barry liked them. It shows our club\r\nis doing some good in the world. Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our\r\nobject in everything. I do really try to make it my object but I forget\r\nso often when I\xe2\x80\x99m having fun. I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan\r\nwhen I grow up. Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say there was a great deal\xe2\x80\x9d was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly, forgetful little\r\ngirl as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always so good as she is now either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne\r\nseriously. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me so herself--that is, she said she was a dreadful\r\nmischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes. I felt\r\nso encouraged when I heard that. Is it very wicked of me, Marilla,\r\nto feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and\r\nmischievous? Mrs. Lynde says it is. Mrs. Lynde says she always feels\r\nshocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how\r\nsmall they were. Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that\r\nwhen he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s pantry\r\nand she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave felt that way. I\xe2\x80\x99d have thought that it was real noble of him to\r\nconfess it, and I\xe2\x80\x99d have thought what an encouraging thing it would be\r\nfor small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them\r\nto know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how I\xe2\x80\x99d feel, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way I feel at present, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cis that it\xe2\x80\x99s high time\r\nyou had those dishes washed. You\xe2\x80\x99ve taken half an hour longer than\r\nyou should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk\r\nafterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. Vanity and Vexation of Spirit\r\n\r\n\r\nMarilla, walking home one late April evening from an Aid meeting,\r\nrealized that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight\r\nthat spring never fails to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to\r\nthe youngest and merriest. Marilla was not given to subjective analysis\r\nof her thoughts and feelings. She probably imagined that she was\r\nthinking about the Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet\r\nfor the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious\r\nconsciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the\r\ndeclining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the\r\nmeadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a\r\nmirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden\r\npulses under the gray sod. The spring was abroad in the land and\r\nMarilla\xe2\x80\x99s sober, middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because of its\r\ndeep, primal gladness.\r\n\r\nHer eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables, peering through its\r\nnetwork of trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in\r\nseveral little coruscations of glory. Marilla, as she picked her steps\r\nalong the damp lane, thought that it was really a satisfaction to know\r\nthat she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table\r\nnicely spread for tea, instead of to the cold comfort of old Aid meeting\r\nevenings before Anne had come to Green Gables.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black\r\nout, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and\r\nirritated. She had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, but now she must hurry to take off her second-best dress and\r\nprepare the meal herself against Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s return from plowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll settle Miss Anne when she comes home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla grimly, as\r\nshe shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was\r\nstrictly necessary. Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for\r\nhis tea in his corner. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing\r\nstories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never\r\nthinking once about the time or her duties. She\xe2\x80\x99s just got to be pulled\r\nup short and sudden on this sort of thing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if Mrs. Allan\r\ndoes say she\xe2\x80\x99s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. She may\r\nbe bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever any knowing what shape it\xe2\x80\x99ll break out in next. Just as soon as\r\nshe grows out of one freak she takes up with another. But there! Here I\r\nam saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at\r\nthe Aid today. I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for\r\nif she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I know I\xe2\x80\x99d have said something too sharp to Rachel before\r\neverybody. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it\r\nfrom me to deny it. But I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who\xe2\x80\x99d\r\npick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea. Just\r\nthe same, Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told\r\nher she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must\r\nsay, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy\r\nbefore and I\xe2\x80\x99m real sorry to find her so now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, who, being patient and wise and,\r\nabove all, hungry, had deemed it best to let Marilla talk her wrath\r\nout unhindered, having learned by experience that she got through\r\nwith whatever work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely\r\nargument. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re judging her too hasty, Marilla. Don\xe2\x80\x99t call her\r\nuntrustworthy until you\xe2\x80\x99re sure she has disobeyed you. Mebbe it can all\r\nbe explained--Anne\xe2\x80\x99s a great hand at explaining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not here when I told her to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll find it hard to explain _that_ to my satisfaction. Of course I knew\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d take her part, Matthew. But I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing her up, not you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was dark when supper was ready, and still no sign of Anne, coming\r\nhurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane, breathless and\r\nrepentant with a sense of neglected duties. Marilla washed and put away\r\nthe dishes grimly. Then, wanting a candle to light her way down the\r\ncellar, she went up to the east gable for the one that generally stood\r\non Anne\xe2\x80\x99s table. Lighting it, she turned around to see Anne herself\r\nlying on the bed, face downward among the pillows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us,\xe2\x80\x9d said astonished Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9chave you been asleep, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the muffled reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sick then?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Marilla anxiously, going over to the bed.\r\n\r\nAnne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself\r\nforever from mortal eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But please, Marilla, go away and don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me. I\xe2\x80\x99m in the\r\ndepths of despair and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who gets head in class or writes the\r\nbest composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more. Little\r\nthings like that are of no importance now because I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\never be able to go anywhere again. My career is closed. Please, Marilla,\r\ngo away and don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anyone ever hear the like?\xe2\x80\x9d the mystified Marilla wanted to know.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, whatever is the matter with you? What have you done? Get\r\nright up this minute and tell me. This minute, I say. There now, what is\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at my hair, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Marilla lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s hair, flowing in heavy masses down her back. It certainly had a\r\nvery strange appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, what have you done to your hair? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s _green!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreen it might be called, if it were any earthly color--a queer,\r\ndull, bronzy green, with streaks here and there of the original red\r\nto heighten the ghastly effect. Never in all her life had Marilla seen\r\nanything so grotesque as Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hair at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s green,\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought nothing could be as bad as\r\nred hair. But now I know it\xe2\x80\x99s ten times worse to have green hair. Oh,\r\nMarilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI little know how you got into this fix, but I mean to find out,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarilla. \xe2\x80\x9cCome right down to the kitchen--it\xe2\x80\x99s too cold up here--and\r\ntell me just what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been expecting something queer for\r\nsome time. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got into any scrape for over two months, and I\r\nwas sure another one was due. Now, then, what did you do to your hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dyed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDyed it! Dyed your hair! Anne Shirley, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know it was a wicked\r\nthing to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I knew it was a little wicked,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought it\r\nwas worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair. I counted\r\nthe cost, Marilla. Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to\r\nmake up for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99d decided it was worth while\r\nto dye my hair I\xe2\x80\x99d have dyed it a decent color at least. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndyed it green.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to dye it green, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne dejectedly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He said it would\r\nturn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it\r\nwould. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels like\r\nto have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect\r\nanyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot. I have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t then and I believed every word he said _implicitly_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho said? Who are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe peddler that was here this afternoon. I bought the dye from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, how often have I told you never to let one of those\r\nItalians in the house! I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in encouraging them to come\r\naround at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t let him in the house. I remembered what you told me, and I\r\nwent out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step.\r\nBesides, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an Italian--he was a German Jew. He had a big box\r\nfull of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to\r\nmake enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He\r\nspoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy\r\nsomething from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once\r\nI saw the bottle of hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye\r\nany hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wash off. In a trice I\r\nsaw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was\r\nirresistible. But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I\r\nhad only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler\r\nhad a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he\xe2\x80\x99d sell it\r\nfor fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as\r\nsoon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush\r\nas the directions said. I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla,\r\nwhen I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being\r\nwicked, I can tell you. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been repenting ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll repent to good purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla severely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you,\r\nAnne. Goodness knows what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done. I suppose the first thing is to\r\ngive your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and\r\nwater, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been\r\nscouring its original red. The peddler had certainly spoken the truth\r\nwhen he declared that the dye wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wash off, however his veracity\r\nmight be impeached in other respects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, what shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Anne in tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI can never\r\nlive this down. People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes--the\r\nliniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with\r\nMrs. Lynde. But they\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget this. They will think I am not\r\nrespectable. Oh, Marilla, \xe2\x80\x98what a tangled web we weave when first we\r\npractice to deceive.\xe2\x80\x99 That is poetry, but it is true. And oh, how Josie\r\nPye will laugh! Marilla, I _cannot_ face Josie Pye. I am the unhappiest\r\ngirl in Prince Edward Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness continued for a week. During that time she went\r\nnowhere and shampooed her hair every day. Diana alone of outsiders knew\r\nthe fatal secret, but she promised solemnly never to tell, and it may\r\nbe stated here and now that she kept her word. At the end of the week\r\nMarilla said decidedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use, Anne. That is fast dye if ever there was any. Your hair\r\nmust be cut off; there is no other way. You can\xe2\x80\x99t go out with it looking\r\nlike that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremarks. With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease cut it off at once, Marilla, and have it over. Oh, I feel that\r\nmy heart is broken. This is such an unromantic affliction. The girls in\r\nbooks lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good\r\ndeed, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind losing my hair in some such fashion\r\nhalf so much. But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut\r\noff because you\xe2\x80\x99ve dyed it a dreadful color, is there? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to weep\r\nall the time you\xe2\x80\x99re cutting it off, if it won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere. It seems such\r\na tragic thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne wept then, but later on, when she went upstairs and looked in the\r\nglass, she was calm with despair. Marilla had done her work thoroughly\r\nand it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible.\r\nThe result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be. Anne\r\npromptly turned her glass to the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed passionately.\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly righted the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will, too. I\xe2\x80\x99d do penance for being wicked that way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look\r\nat myself every time I come to my room and see how ugly I am. And I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t try to imagine it away, either. I never thought I was vain about\r\nmy hair, of all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being\r\nred, because it was so long and thick and curly. I expect something will\r\nhappen to my nose next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday,\r\nbut to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie\r\nPye, who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she looked like a\r\nperfect scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything when Josie said that to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne confided\r\nthat evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her\r\nheadaches, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought\r\nto bear it patiently. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be told you look like a scarecrow\r\nand I wanted to say something back. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I just swept her one\r\nscornful look and then I forgave her. It makes you feel very virtuous\r\nwhen you forgive people, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I mean to devote all my energies\r\nto being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again. Of\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s better to be good. I know it is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes so hard\r\nto believe a thing even when you know it. I do really want to be good,\r\nMarilla, like you and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a\r\ncredit to you. Diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black\r\nvelvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side. She says she\r\nthinks it will be very becoming. I will call it a snood--that sounds so\r\nromantic. But am I talking too much, Marilla? Does it hurt your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy head is better now. It was terrible bad this afternoon, though.\r\nThese headaches of mine are getting worse and worse. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see\r\na doctor about them. As for your chatter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I mind\r\nit--I\xe2\x80\x99ve got so used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich was Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s way of saying that she liked to hear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. An Unfortunate Lily Maid\r\n\r\n\r\n|OF course you must be Elaine, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cI could never have\r\nthe courage to float down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruby Gillis, with a shiver. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind floating down\r\nwhen there\xe2\x80\x99s two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun\r\nthen. But to lie down and pretend I was dead--I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99d die\r\nreally of fright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would be romantic,\xe2\x80\x9d conceded Jane Andrews, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep still. I\xe2\x80\x99d be popping up every minute or so to see where I\r\nwas and if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t drifting too far out. And you know, Anne, that would\r\nspoil the effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine,\xe2\x80\x9d mourned Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot afraid to float down and I\xe2\x80\x99d love to be Elaine. But it\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous\r\njust the same. Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has\r\nsuch lovely long golden hair--Elaine had \xe2\x80\x98all her bright hair streaming\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x99 you know. And Elaine was the lily maid. Now, a red-haired person\r\ncannot be a lily maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour complexion is just as fair as Ruby\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyour hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Anne, flushing sensitively with\r\ndelight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sometimes thought it was myself--but I never dared to ask\r\nanyone for fear she would tell me it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Do you think it could be\r\ncalled auburn now, Diana?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I think it is real pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, looking admiringly at\r\nthe short, silky curls that clustered over Anne\xe2\x80\x99s head and were held in\r\nplace by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow.\r\n\r\nThey were standing on the bank of the pond, below Orchard Slope, where\r\na little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip\r\nwas a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience\r\nof fishermen and duck hunters. Ruby and Jane were spending the midsummer\r\nafternoon with Diana, and Anne had come over to play with them.\r\n\r\nAnne and Diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about\r\nthe pond. Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly\r\ncut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring.\r\nAnne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the\r\nromance of it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and\r\nDiana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for\r\nsuch childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating\r\nsports to be found about the pond. It was splendid to fish for trout\r\nover the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the\r\nlittle flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck shooting.\r\n\r\nIt was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s idea that they dramatize Elaine. They had studied\r\nTennyson\xe2\x80\x99s poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of\r\nEducation having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince\r\nEdward Island schools. They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to\r\npieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all\r\nleft in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and\r\nGuinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them, and Anne\r\nwas devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in Camelot.\r\nThose days, she said, were so much more romantic than the present.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if\r\nthe flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down\r\nwith the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another\r\nheadland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often\r\ngone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing\r\nElaine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be Elaine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although\r\nshe would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet\r\nher artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her\r\nlimitations made impossible. \xe2\x80\x9cRuby, you must be King Arthur and Jane\r\nwill be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot. But first you must be the\r\nbrothers and the father. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have the old dumb servitor because\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t room for two in the flat when one is lying down. We must\r\npall the barge all its length in blackest samite. That old black shawl\r\nof your mother\xe2\x80\x99s will be just the thing, Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and\r\nthen lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she does look really dead,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Ruby Gillis nervously,\r\nwatching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of\r\nthe birches. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me feel frightened, girls. Do you suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is\r\nabominably wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuby, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about Mrs. Lynde,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne severely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nspoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde\r\nwas born. Jane, you arrange this. It\xe2\x80\x99s silly for Elaine to be talking\r\nwhen she\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none,\r\nbut an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent\r\nsubstitute. A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of\r\na tall blue iris placed in one of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s folded hands was all that could\r\nbe desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, she\xe2\x80\x99s all ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must kiss her quiet brows\r\nand, Diana, you say, \xe2\x80\x98Sister, farewell forever,\xe2\x80\x99 and Ruby, you say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Farewell, sweet sister,\xe2\x80\x99 both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly\r\ncan. Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine \xe2\x80\x98lay as\r\nthough she smiled.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s better. Now push the flat off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old\r\nembedded stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long\r\nenough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before\r\nscampering up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower\r\nheadland where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be\r\nin readiness to receive the lily maid.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her\r\nsituation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The\r\nflat began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine\r\nto scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall\r\nof blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her\r\nbarge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at\r\nthe landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne\r\ndid not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was\r\nin a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long\r\nbefore it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left\r\nbehind at the landing!\r\n\r\nAnne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was\r\nwhite to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession. There was\r\none chance--just one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was horribly frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Mrs. Allan the next day, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\r\nseemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the\r\nwater rising in it every moment. I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly,\r\nbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could\r\nsave me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge\r\npiles for me to climb up on it. You know the piles are just old tree\r\ntrunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them. It was\r\nproper to pray, but I had to do my part by watching out and right well\r\nI knew it. I just said, \xe2\x80\x98Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the rest,\xe2\x80\x99 over and over again. Under such circumstances you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think much about making a flowery prayer. But mine was answered,\r\nfor the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf\r\nand the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential\r\nstub. And there I was, Mrs. Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile\r\nwith no way of getting up or down. It was a very unromantic position,\r\nbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think about that at the time. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think much about\r\nromance when you have just escaped from a watery grave. I said a\r\ngrateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on\r\ntight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get\r\nback to dry land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream.\r\nRuby, Jane, and Diana, already awaiting it on the lower headland, saw it\r\ndisappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that Anne\r\nhad gone down with it. For a moment they stood still, white as sheets,\r\nfrozen with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of\r\ntheir voices, they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never\r\npausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge.\r\nAnne, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying\r\nforms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her\r\nposition was a very uncomfortable one.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily\r\nmaid. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they\r\nhad fainted, one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she grew so\r\ntired and cramped that she could hold on no longer! Anne looked at the\r\nwicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and\r\nshivered. Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome\r\npossibilities to her.\r\n\r\nThen, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her\r\narms and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the\r\nbridge in Harmon Andrews\xe2\x80\x99s dory!\r\n\r\nGilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white\r\nscornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also\r\nscornful gray eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley! How on earth did you get there?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended\r\nhis hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious,\r\nin the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was\r\ncertainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gilbert, taking up his oars. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were\r\nplaying Elaine\xe2\x80\x9d explained Anne frigidly, without even looking at her\r\nrescuer, \xe2\x80\x9cand I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge--I mean the\r\nflat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile. The girls\r\nwent for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance,\r\nsprang nimbly on shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said haughtily as she turned away.\r\nBut Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand\r\non her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9clook here. Can\xe2\x80\x99t we be good friends? I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nawfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to vex\r\nyou and I only meant it for a joke. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s so long ago. I think\r\nyour hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Anne hesitated. She had an odd, newly awakened\r\nconsciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy,\r\nhalf-eager expression in Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s hazel eyes was something that was\r\nvery good to see. Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the\r\nbitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering\r\ndetermination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her\r\nrecollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had\r\ncalled her \xe2\x80\x9ccarrots\xe2\x80\x9d and had brought about her disgrace before the whole\r\nschool. Her resentment, which to other and older people might be as\r\nlaughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time\r\nseemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never forgive him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never be friends with you, Gilbert\r\nBlythe; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his\r\ncheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley. And I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care either!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep,\r\nferny little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but\r\nshe was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She almost wished she had\r\nanswered Gilbert differently. Of course, he had insulted her terribly,\r\nbut still--! Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to\r\nsit down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the\r\nreaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.\r\n\r\nHalfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in\r\na state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at\r\nOrchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had\r\nsuccumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she\r\nmight, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the\r\nbrook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla\r\nhad gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former\xe2\x80\x99s neck\r\nand weeping with relief and delight, \xe2\x80\x9coh, Anne--we thought--you\r\nwere--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you\r\nbe--Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI climbed up on one of the piles,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Anne wearily, \xe2\x80\x9cand Gilbert\r\nBlythe came along in Mr. Andrews\xe2\x80\x99s dory and brought me to land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s so romantic!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane,\r\nfinding breath enough for utterance at last. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to\r\nhim after this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old\r\nspirit. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t want ever to hear the word \xe2\x80\x98romantic\xe2\x80\x99 again, Jane\r\nAndrews. I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my\r\nfault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do\r\ngets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone and lost your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we\xe2\x80\x99ll not be\r\nallowed to row on the pond any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt\r\nto do. Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households\r\nwhen the events of the afternoon became known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you ever have any sense, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I think I will, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Anne optimistically. A good\r\ncry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed\r\nher nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cI think my\r\nprospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a new and valuable lesson today.\r\nEver since I came to Green Gables I\xe2\x80\x99ve been making mistakes, and each\r\nmistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of\r\nthe amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong\r\nto me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run\r\naway with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in\r\ncooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair\r\nand nose now--at least, very seldom. And today\xe2\x80\x99s mistake is going to\r\ncure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is\r\nno use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in\r\ntowered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated\r\nnow. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me\r\nin this respect, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla skeptically.\r\n\r\nBut Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder when Marilla had gone out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t give up all your romance, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered shyly, \xe2\x80\x9ca little\r\nof it is a good thing--not too much, of course--but keep a little of it,\r\nAnne, keep a little of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. An Epoch in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s Life\r\n\r\n\r\n|ANNE was bringing the cows home from the back pasture by way of Lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLane. It was a September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the\r\nwoods were brimmed up with ruby sunset light. Here and there the lane\r\nwas splashed with it, but for the most part it was already quite shadowy\r\nbeneath the maples, and the spaces under the firs were filled with a\r\nclear violet dusk like airy wine. The winds were out in their tops, and\r\nthere is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the\r\nfir trees at evening.\r\n\r\nThe cows swung placidly down the lane, and Anne followed them dreamily,\r\nrepeating aloud the battle canto from _Marmion_--which had also been part\r\nof their English course the preceding winter and which Miss Stacy had\r\nmade them learn off by heart--and exulting in its rushing lines and the\r\nclash of spears in its imagery. When she came to the lines\r\n\r\n       The stubborn spearsmen still made good\r\n       Their dark impenetrable wood,\r\n\r\nshe stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy\r\nherself one of that heroic ring. When she opened them again it was to\r\nbehold Diana coming through the gate that led into the Barry field and\r\nlooking so important that Anne instantly divined there was news to be\r\ntold. But betray too eager curiosity she would not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this evening just like a purple dream, Diana? It makes me so glad\r\nto be alive. In the mornings I always think the mornings are best; but\r\nwhen evening comes I think it\xe2\x80\x99s lovelier still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very fine evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cbut oh, I have such news, Anne.\r\nGuess. You can have three guesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlotte Gillis is going to be married in the church after all and\r\nMrs. Allan wants us to decorate it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s beau won\xe2\x80\x99t agree to that, because nobody ever has been\r\nmarried in the church yet, and he thinks it would seem too much like a\r\nfuneral. It\xe2\x80\x99s too mean, because it would be such fun. Guess again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane\xe2\x80\x99s mother is going to let her have a birthday party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana shook her head, her black eyes dancing with merriment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think what it can be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne in despair, \xe2\x80\x9cunless it\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nMoody Spurgeon MacPherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night.\r\nDid he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Diana indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be likely\r\nto boast of it if he did, the horrid creature! I knew you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guess\r\nit. Mother had a letter from Aunt Josephine today, and Aunt Josephine\r\nwants you and me to go to town next Tuesday and stop with her for the\r\nExhibition. There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Anne, finding it necessary to lean up against a\r\nmaple tree for support, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you really mean it? But I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid Marilla\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let me go. She will say that she can\xe2\x80\x99t encourage gadding about.\r\nThat was what she said last week when Jane invited me to go with them\r\nin their double-seated buggy to the American concert at the White Sands\r\nHotel. I wanted to go, but Marilla said I\xe2\x80\x99d be better at home learning\r\nmy lessons and so would Jane. I was bitterly disappointed, Diana. I felt\r\nso heartbroken that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say my prayers when I went to bed. But I\r\nrepented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll get Mother to ask Marilla. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nmore likely to let you go then; and if she does we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the time\r\nof our lives, Anne. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to an Exhibition, and it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\naggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips. Jane and\r\nRuby have been twice, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going this year again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go\r\nor not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne resolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I did and then was disappointed, it\r\nwould be more than I could bear. But in case I do go I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad my\r\nnew coat will be ready by that time. Marilla didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I needed a new\r\ncoat. She said my old one would do very well for another winter and\r\nthat I ought to be satisfied with having a new dress. The dress is very\r\npretty, Diana--navy blue and made so fashionably. Marilla always makes\r\nmy dresses fashionably now, because she says she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to have\r\nMatthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad. It is ever so\r\nmuch easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable. At least, it is\r\neasier for me. I suppose it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make such a difference to naturally\r\ngood people. But Matthew said I must have a new coat, so Marilla\r\nbought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth, and it\xe2\x80\x99s being made by a real\r\ndressmaker over at Carmody. It\xe2\x80\x99s to be done Saturday night, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntrying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on Sunday in\r\nmy new suit and cap, because I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it isn\xe2\x80\x99t right to imagine such\r\nthings. But it just slips into my mind in spite of me. My cap is so\r\npretty. Matthew bought it for me the day we were over at Carmody. It is\r\none of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage, with gold\r\ncord and tassels. Your new hat is elegant, Diana, and so becoming. When\r\nI saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to\r\nthink you were my dearest friend. Do you suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong for us to\r\nthink so much about our clothes? Marilla says it is very sinful. But it\r\nis such an interesting subject, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla agreed to let Anne go to town, and it was arranged that\r\nMr. Barry should take the girls in on the following Tuesday. As\r\nCharlottetown was thirty miles away and Mr. Barry wished to go and\r\nreturn the same day, it was necessary to make a very early start. But\r\nAnne counted it all joy, and was up before sunrise on Tuesday morning.\r\nA glance from her window assured her that the day would be fine, for\r\nthe eastern sky behind the firs of the Haunted Wood was all silvery\r\nand cloudless. Through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the\r\nwestern gable of Orchard Slope, a token that Diana was also up.\r\n\r\nAnne was dressed by the time Matthew had the fire on and had the\r\nbreakfast ready when Marilla came down, but for her own part was much\r\ntoo excited to eat. After breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were\r\ndonned, and Anne hastened over the brook and up through the firs to\r\nOrchard Slope. Mr. Barry and Diana were waiting for her, and they were\r\nsoon on the road.\r\n\r\nIt was a long drive, but Anne and Diana enjoyed every minute of it. It\r\nwas delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red\r\nsunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields. The air was\r\nfresh and crisp, and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys\r\nand floated off from the hills. Sometimes the road went through woods\r\nwhere maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it\r\ncrossed rivers on bridges that made Anne\xe2\x80\x99s flesh cringe with the old,\r\nhalf-delightful fear; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed\r\nby a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to\r\nhills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be\r\nseen; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss. It was\r\nalmost noon when they reached town and found their way to \xe2\x80\x9cBeechwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It was quite a fine old mansion, set back from the street in a seclusion\r\nof green elms and branching beeches. Miss Barry met them at the door\r\nwith a twinkle in her sharp black eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to see me at last, you Anne-girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMercy,\r\nchild, how you have grown! You\xe2\x80\x99re taller than I am, I declare. And\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re ever so much better looking than you used to be, too. But I dare\r\nsay you know that without being told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne radiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m not so freckled as\r\nI used to be, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve much to be thankful for, but I really hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dared\r\nto hope there was any other improvement. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you think there is,\r\nMiss Barry.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Barry\xe2\x80\x99s house was furnished with \xe2\x80\x9cgreat magnificence,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n as Anne told Marilla afterward. The two little country girls were rather\r\nabashed by the splendor of the parlor where Miss Barry left them when\r\nshe went to see about dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it just like a palace?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cI never was in Aunt\r\nJosephine\xe2\x80\x99s house before, and I\xe2\x80\x99d no idea it was so grand. I just wish\r\nJulia Bell could see this--she puts on such airs about her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparlor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVelvet carpet,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Anne luxuriously, \xe2\x80\x9cand silk curtains! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndreamed of such things, Diana. But do you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I feel\r\nvery comfortable with them after all. There are so many things in this\r\nroom and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination. That is\r\none consolation when you are poor--there are so many more things you can\r\nimagine about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir sojourn in town was something that Anne and Diana dated from for\r\nyears. From first to last it was crowded with delights.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept\r\nthem there all day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne related to Marilla later on. \xe2\x80\x9cI never imagined\r\nanything so interesting. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know which department was the\r\nmost interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the\r\nfancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was\r\nreal glad she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nimproving, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuccess? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples\r\nand Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was\r\nridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after\r\nthis when he was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a\r\nprize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter\r\nand cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Mrs.\r\nLynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her\r\nuntil I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There\r\nwere thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully\r\ninsignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see\r\nthe horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go; she said horse racing was an\r\nabomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty\r\nto set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe Mrs. Lynde\xe2\x80\x99s absence would ever be noticed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\r\nthough, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_\r\nawfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me\r\nten cents that the red horse would win. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe he would, but\r\nI refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about\r\neverything, and I felt sure it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to tell her that. It\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nwrong to do anything you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell the minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife. It\xe2\x80\x99s as good as\r\nan extra conscience to have a minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife for your friend. And I was\r\nvery glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have\r\nlost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man\r\ngo up in a balloon. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would\r\nbe simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten\r\ncents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave\r\nDiana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I\r\nwould marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go\r\nacross water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after\r\nthat, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep at\r\nnight. Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. It\r\nwas an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in a spare room isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwhat I used to think it was. That\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of growing up, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbeginning to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a\r\nchild don\xe2\x80\x99t seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThursday the girls had a drive in the park, and in the evening Miss\r\nBarry took them to a concert in the Academy of Music, where a noted\r\nprima donna was to sing. To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, it was beyond description. I was so excited I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven talk, so you may know what it was like. I just sat in enraptured\r\nsilence. Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin\r\nand diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything\r\nelse. Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could\r\nnever be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to\r\nthe stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears.\r\nI was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nhow I was ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if\r\nwe went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream\r\nit might help me. That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found\r\nit true. The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and\r\ndissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night.\r\nDiana said she believed she was born for city life. Miss Barry asked\r\nme what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very\r\nseriously before I could tell her what I really thought. So I thought it\r\nover after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And\r\nI came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born for city life and\r\nthat I was glad of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant\r\nrestaurants at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night once in a while; but as a regular\r\nthing I\xe2\x80\x99d rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind\r\nof knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that\r\nthe wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry\r\nso at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally\r\nlaughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to be funny.\r\nBut she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriday brought going-home time, and Mr. Barry drove in for the girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed yourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Barry, as she bade\r\nthem good-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed we have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Anne-girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed every minute of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, throwing her arms\r\nimpulsively about the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek.\r\nDiana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast\r\nat Anne\xe2\x80\x99s freedom. But Miss Barry was pleased, and she stood on her\r\nveranda and watched the buggy out of sight. Then she went back into her\r\nbig house with a sigh. It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young\r\nlives. Miss Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must\r\nbe told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself. She valued\r\npeople only as they were of service to her or amused her. Anne had\r\namused her, and consequently stood high in the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s good graces.\r\nBut Miss Barry found herself thinking less about Anne\xe2\x80\x99s quaint speeches\r\nthan of her fresh enthusiasms, her transparent emotions, her little\r\nwinning ways, and the sweetness of her eyes and lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she\xe2\x80\x99d adopted\r\na girl out of an orphan asylum,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I guess she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t make much of a mistake after all. If I\xe2\x80\x99d a child like Anne in the\r\nhouse all the time I\xe2\x80\x99d be a better and happier woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne and Diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive\r\nin--pleasanter, indeed, since there was the delightful consciousness of\r\nhome waiting at the end of it. It was sunset when they passed through\r\nWhite Sands and turned into the shore road. Beyond, the Avonlea hills\r\ncame out darkly against the saffron sky. Behind them the moon was rising\r\nout of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light.\r\nEvery little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing\r\nripples. The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and\r\nthe tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to be alive and to be going home,\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Anne.\r\n\r\nWhen she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of\r\nGreen Gables winked her a friendly welcome back, and through the open\r\ndoor shone the hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the\r\nchilly autumn night. Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen,\r\nwhere a hot supper was waiting on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve got back?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, folding up her knitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s so good to be back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nkiss everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken! You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you cooked that for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be hungry after such\r\na drive and need something real appetizing. Hurry and take off your\r\nthings, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got back, I must say. It\xe2\x80\x99s been fearful lonesome here without\r\nyou, and I never put in four longer days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and\r\ngave them a full account of her visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a splendid time,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded happily, \xe2\x80\x9cand I feel that it\r\nmarks an epoch in my life. But the best of it all was the coming home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. The Queens Class Is Organized\r\n\r\n\r\n|MARILLA laid her knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair. Her\r\neyes were tired, and she thought vaguely that she must see about having\r\nher glasses changed the next time she went to town, for her eyes had\r\ngrown tired very often of late.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark, for the full November twilight had fallen around\r\nGreen Gables, and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing\r\nred flames in the stove.\r\n\r\nAnne was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that\r\njoyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled\r\nfrom the maple cordwood. She had been reading, but her book had slipped\r\nto the floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips.\r\nGlittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and\r\nrainbows of her lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling\r\nwere happening to her in cloudland--adventures that always turned out\r\ntriumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMarilla looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been\r\nsuffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling\r\nof fireshine and shadow. The lesson of a love that should display itself\r\neasily in spoken word and open look was one Marilla could never learn.\r\nBut she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection\r\nall the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness. Her love\r\nmade her afraid of being unduly indulgent, indeed. She had an uneasy\r\nfeeling that it was rather sinful to set one\xe2\x80\x99s heart so intensely on any\r\nhuman creature as she had set hers on Anne, and perhaps she performed a\r\nsort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical\r\nthan if the girl had been less dear to her. Certainly Anne herself had\r\nno idea how Marilla loved her. She sometimes thought wistfully that\r\nMarilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy\r\nand understanding. But she always checked the thought reproachfully,\r\nremembering what she owed to Marilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Stacy was here this afternoon when\r\nyou were out with Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne came back from her other world with a start and a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she? Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you call me, Marilla?\r\nDiana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It\xe2\x80\x99s lovely in the woods\r\nnow. All the little wood things--the ferns and the satin leaves and the\r\ncrackerberries--have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had tucked them\r\naway until spring under a blanket of leaves. I think it was a little\r\ngray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last\r\nmoonlight night and did it. Diana wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say much about that, though.\r\nDiana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about\r\nimagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on\r\nDiana\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a\r\nblighted being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby\r\nsaid she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. Ruby\r\nGillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse\r\nshe is. Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do to\r\ndrag them into everything, does it? Diana and I are thinking seriously\r\nof promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids\r\nand live together forever. Diana hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite made up her mind though,\r\nbecause she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild,\r\ndashing, wicked young man and reform him. Diana and I talk a great deal\r\nabout serious subjects now, you know. We feel that we are so much older\r\nthan we used to be that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t becoming to talk of childish matters.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla. Miss Stacy took\r\nall us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and\r\ntalked to us about it. She said we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too careful what habits\r\nwe formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because by the time\r\nwe were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid\r\nfor our whole future life. And she said if the foundation was shaky we\r\ncould never build anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked\r\nthe matter over coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn,\r\nMarilla. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and\r\nform respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as\r\npossible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be\r\nproperly developed. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly appalling to think of being twenty,\r\nMarilla. It sounds so fearfully old and grown up. But why was Miss Stacy\r\nhere this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I want to tell you, Anne, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever give me a chance\r\nto get a word in edgewise. She was talking about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout me?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne looked rather scared. Then she flushed and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know what she was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly\r\nI did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school\r\nyesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian\r\nhistory. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour,\r\nand I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply\r\nwild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win,\r\nbecause it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be poetical justice if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t--so I spread the\r\nhistory open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and\r\nmy knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know,\r\nwhile all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it\r\nthat I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at\r\nonce I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so\r\nreproachful-like. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla,\r\nespecially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur\r\naway, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and\r\ntalked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I\r\nwas wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly,\r\nI was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a\r\nhistory when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that\r\nmoment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I\r\ncried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I\xe2\x80\x99d never do such\r\na thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking\r\nat Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned\r\nout. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require that, and she forgave me\r\nfreely. So I think it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very kind of her to come up here to you\r\nabout it after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your\r\nguilty conscience that\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you. You have no business to be\r\ntaking storybooks to school. You read too many novels anyhow. When I was\r\na girl I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as allowed to look at a novel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it\xe2\x80\x99s really such a religious\r\nbook?\xe2\x80\x9d protested Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s a little too exciting to be\r\nproper reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays. And I never\r\nread _any_ book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it is a\r\nproper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. Miss Stacy\r\nmade me promise that. She found me reading a book one day called, The\r\nLurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall. It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me,\r\nand, oh, Marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy. It just curdled the\r\nblood in my veins. But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome\r\nbook, and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind promising not to read any more like it, but it was _agonizing_\r\nto give back that book without knowing how it turned out. But my love\r\nfor Miss Stacy stood the test and I did. It\xe2\x80\x99s really wonderful, Marilla,\r\nwhat you can do when you\xe2\x80\x99re truly anxious to please a certain person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll light the lamp and get to work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsee plainly that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear what Miss Stacy had to say.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed, Marilla, I do want to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne contritely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t say another word--not one. I know I talk too much, but I am really\r\ntrying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only\r\nknew how many things I want to say and don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99d give me some credit\r\nfor it. Please tell me, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students\r\nwho mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen\xe2\x80\x99s. She intends\r\nto give them extra lessons for an hour after school. And she came to ask\r\nMatthew and me if we would like to have you join it. What do you think\r\nabout it yourself, Anne? Would you like to go to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s and pass for a\r\nteacher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne straightened to her knees and clasped her hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been the dream of my life--that is, for the last six months, ever\r\nsince Ruby and Jane began to talk of studying for the Entrance. But I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about it, because I supposed it would be perfectly\r\nuseless. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to be a teacher. But won\xe2\x80\x99t it be dreadfully expensive?\r\nMr. Andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put Prissy\r\nthrough, and Prissy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a dunce in geometry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you needn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that part of it. When Matthew and I\r\ntook you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you\r\nand give you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn\r\nher own living whether she ever has to or not. You\xe2\x80\x99ll always have a home\r\nat Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what\r\nis going to happen in this uncertain world, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just as well to be\r\nprepared. So you can join the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s class if you like, Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne flung her arms about Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s waist and\r\nlooked up earnestly into her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m extremely grateful to you and\r\nMatthew. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a\r\ncredit to you. I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but I think I\r\ncan hold my own in anything else if I work hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you\xe2\x80\x99ll get along well enough. Miss Stacy says you are bright\r\nand diligent.\xe2\x80\x9d Not for worlds would Marilla have told Anne just what\r\nMiss Stacy had said about her; that would have been to pamper vanity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books.\r\nThere is no hurry. You won\xe2\x80\x99t be ready to try the Entrance for a year and\r\na half yet. But it\xe2\x80\x99s well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded,\r\nMiss Stacy says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne\r\nblissfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I have a purpose in life. Mr. Allan says everybody\r\nshould have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. Only he says\r\nwe must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. I would call it a\r\nworthy purpose to want to be a teacher like Miss Stacy, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nMarilla? I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very noble profession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Queen\xe2\x80\x99s class was organized in due time. Gilbert Blythe, Anne\r\nShirley, Ruby Gillis, Jane Andrews, Josie Pye, Charlie Sloane, and Moody\r\nSpurgeon MacPherson joined it. Diana Barry did not, as her parents\r\ndid not intend to send her to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s. This seemed nothing short of a\r\ncalamity to Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the\r\ncroup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when\r\nthe Queen\xe2\x80\x99s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and\r\nAnne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through\r\nthe Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep\r\nher seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump\r\ncame into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her\r\nuplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds\r\nwould Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of\r\ndeath, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go\r\nout alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mournfully that night. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought how splendid it\r\nwould have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance,\r\ntoo. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs.\r\nLynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby\r\nare just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their\r\nambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets\r\nthrough, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote\r\nher whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid\r\na salary for teaching, but a husband won\xe2\x80\x99t pay you anything, and growls\r\nif you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks\r\nfrom mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a\r\nperfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she\r\nis just going to college for education\xe2\x80\x99s sake, because she won\xe2\x80\x99t have to\r\nearn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who\r\nare living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to\r\nbe a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anything else with a name\r\nlike that to live up to. I hope it isn\xe2\x80\x99t wicked of me, Marilla, but\r\nreally the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little\r\nblue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will\r\nbe more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde\r\nsays he\xe2\x80\x99ll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest\r\npeople, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Gilbert Blythe going to be?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Marilla, seeing that Anne\r\nwas opening her Caesar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to know what Gilbert Blythe\xe2\x80\x99s ambition in life is--if he\r\nhas any,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne scornfully.\r\n\r\nThere was open rivalry between Gilbert and Anne now. Previously the\r\nrivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt\r\nthat Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was. He was\r\na foeman worthy of her steel. The other members of the class tacitly\r\nacknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nSince the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea\r\nfor forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry,\r\nhad evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He\r\ntalked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with\r\nthem, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the\r\nother of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley\r\nhe simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be\r\nignored. It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head\r\nthat she did not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart\r\nshe knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake\r\nof Shining Waters again she would answer very differently. All at\r\nonce, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old\r\nresentment she had cherished against him was gone--gone just when she\r\nmost needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every\r\nincident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel\r\nthe old satisfying anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last\r\nspasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten\r\nwithout knowing it. But it was too late.\r\n\r\nAnd at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should\r\never suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nso proud and horrid! She determined to \xe2\x80\x9cshroud her feelings in deepest\r\noblivion,\xe2\x80\x9d and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so\r\nsuccessfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as\r\nhe seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his\r\nretaliatory scorn. The only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed\r\nCharlie Sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and\r\nstudies. For Anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace\r\nof the year. She was happy, eager, interested; there were lessons to be\r\nlearned and honor to be won; delightful books to read; new pieces to be\r\npracticed for the Sunday-school choir; pleasant Saturday afternoons at\r\nthe manse with Mrs. Allan; and then, almost before Anne realized it,\r\nspring had come again to Green Gables and all the world was abloom once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nStudies palled just a wee bit then; the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s class, left behind in\r\nschool while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and\r\nmeadow byways, looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that\r\nLatin verbs and French exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they\r\nhad possessed in the crisp winter months. Even Anne and Gilbert lagged\r\nand grew indifferent. Teacher and taught were alike glad when the term\r\nwas ended and the glad vacation days stretched rosily before them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve done good work this past year,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Stacy told them on the\r\nlast evening, \xe2\x80\x9cand you deserve a good, jolly vacation. Have the best\r\ntime you can in the out-of-door world and lay in a good stock of health\r\nand vitality and ambition to carry you through next year. It will be the\r\ntug of war, you know--the last year before the Entrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to be back next year, Miss Stacy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Josie Pye.\r\n\r\nJosie Pye never scrupled to ask questions; in this instance the rest of\r\nthe class felt grateful to her; none of them would have dared to ask\r\nit of Miss Stacy, but all wanted to, for there had been alarming rumors\r\nrunning at large through the school for some time that Miss Stacy was\r\nnot coming back the next year--that she had been offered a position\r\nin the grade school of her own home district and meant to accept. The\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s class listened in breathless suspense for her answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Stacy. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought of taking another\r\nschool, but I have decided to come back to Avonlea. To tell the truth,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nthem. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay and see you through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Moody Spurgeon. Moody Spurgeon had never been so carried\r\naway by his feelings before, and he blushed uncomfortably every time he\r\nthought about it for a week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, with shining eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Stacy, it would\r\nbe perfectly dreadful if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I could\r\nhave the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Anne got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an\r\nold trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation,\xe2\x80\x9d she told\r\nMarilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\npored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first\r\nbook off by heart, even when the letters _are_ changed. I just feel tired\r\nof everything sensible and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let my imagination run riot for\r\nthe summer. Oh, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99ll only let it run\r\nriot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time\r\nthis summer, for maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the last summer I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a little girl. Mrs.\r\nLynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I\xe2\x80\x99ve done this\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to put on longer skirts. She says I\xe2\x80\x99m all running to legs and\r\neyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live\r\nup to them and be very dignified. It won\xe2\x80\x99t even do to believe in fairies\r\nthen, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid; so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to believe in them with all my whole\r\nheart this summer. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a very gay vacation. Ruby\r\nGillis is going to have a birthday party soon and there\xe2\x80\x99s the Sunday\r\nschool picnic and the missionary concert next month. And Mr. Barry says\r\nthat some evening he\xe2\x80\x99ll take Diana and me over to the White Sands Hotel\r\nand have dinner there. They have dinner there in the evening, you know.\r\nJane Andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling\r\nsight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests\r\nin such beautiful dresses. Jane says it was her first glimpse into high\r\nlife and she\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget it to her dying day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why Marilla had not\r\nbeen at the Aid meeting on Thursday. When Marilla was not at Aid meeting\r\npeople knew there was something wrong at Green Gables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew had a bad spell with his heart Thursday,\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like leaving him. Oh, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s all right again now,\r\nbut he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I\xe2\x80\x99m anxious about\r\nhim. The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement. That\xe2\x80\x99s easy\r\nenough, for Matthew doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go about looking for excitement by any means\r\nand never did, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not to do any very heavy work either and you\r\nmight as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work. Come and lay\r\noff your things, Rachel. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stay to tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, seeing you\xe2\x80\x99re so pressing, perhaps I might as well, stay\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Rachel, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel and Marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while Anne got the\r\ntea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even\r\nMrs. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s criticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say Anne has turned out a real smart girl,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Mrs.\r\nRachel, as Marilla accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be a great help to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, \xe2\x80\x9cand she\xe2\x80\x99s real steady and reliable now. I used\r\nto be afraid she\xe2\x80\x99d never get over her featherbrained ways, but she has\r\nand I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid to trust her in anything now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never would have thought she\xe2\x80\x99d have turned out so well that first day\r\nI was here three years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Rachel. \xe2\x80\x9cLawful heart, shall I\r\never forget that tantrum of hers! When I went home that night I says to\r\nThomas, says I, \xe2\x80\x98Mark my words, Thomas, Marilla Cuthbert \xe2\x80\x98ll live to\r\nrue the step she\xe2\x80\x99s took.\xe2\x80\x99 But I was mistaken and I\xe2\x80\x99m real glad of it. I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t one of those kind of people, Marilla, as can never be brought to\r\nown up that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mistake. No, that never was my way, thank\r\ngoodness. I did make a mistake in judging Anne, but it weren\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nwonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in\r\nthis world, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. There was no ciphering her out by the rules\r\nthat worked with other children. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing short of wonderful how\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s improved these three years, but especially in looks. She\xe2\x80\x99s a real\r\npretty girl got to be, though I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99m overly partial to that\r\npale, big-eyed style myself. I like more snap and color, like Diana\r\nBarry has or Ruby Gillis. Ruby Gillis\xe2\x80\x99s looks are real showy. But\r\nsomehow--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is but when Anne and them are together,\r\nthough she ain\xe2\x80\x99t half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common\r\nand overdone--something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus\r\nalongside of the big, red peonies, that\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. Where the Brook and River Meet\r\n\r\n\r\n|ANNE had her \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly. She and Diana\r\nfairly lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that Lover\xe2\x80\x99s Lane\r\nand the Dryad\xe2\x80\x99s Bubble and Willowmere and Victoria Island afforded.\r\nMarilla offered no objections to Anne\xe2\x80\x99s gypsyings. The Spencervale\r\ndoctor who had come the night Minnie May had the croup met Anne at the\r\nhouse of a patient one afternoon early in vacation, looked her over\r\nsharply, screwed up his mouth, shook his head, and sent a message to\r\nMarilla Cuthbert by another person. It was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet her read books until she gets more spring into her step.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis message frightened Marilla wholesomely. She read Anne\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nwarrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed. As a\r\nresult, Anne had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and\r\nfrolic went. She walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontent; and when September came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a\r\nstep that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full\r\nof ambition and zest once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel just like studying with might and main,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared as she\r\nbrought her books down from the attic. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you good old friends, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad to see your honest faces once more--yes, even you, geometry. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m rejoicing as a\r\nstrong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr.\r\nAllan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every\r\nday and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up\r\nand then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green\r\npreacher. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you,\r\nMarilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we\r\nhave him. If I were a man I think I\xe2\x80\x99d be a minister. They can have\r\nsuch an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be\r\nthrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers\xe2\x80\x99 hearts. Why\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was\r\nshocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might\r\nbe female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank\r\ngoodness we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we\r\nnever would. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why. I think women would make splendid\r\nministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or\r\nanything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe she could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe does plenty of\r\nunofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong\r\nin Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne in a burst of confidence, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you\r\nsomething and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me\r\nterribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about\r\nsuch matters. I do really want to be good; and when I\xe2\x80\x99m with you or Mrs.\r\nAllan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what\r\nwould please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I\xe2\x80\x99m with\r\nMrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the\r\nvery thing she tells me I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to do. I feel irresistibly tempted\r\nto do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m really bad and unregenerate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very\r\neffect on me. I sometimes think she\xe2\x80\x99d have more of an influence for\r\ngood, as you say yourself, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep nagging people to do\r\nright. There should have been a special commandment against nagging.\r\nBut there, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she\r\nmeans well. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks\r\nher share of work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad you feel the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nencouraging. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t worry so much over that after this. But I dare say\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the\r\ntime--things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s another right after. There are so many things to be thought over\r\nand decided when you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the\r\ntime thinking them over and deciding what is right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a serious thing\r\nto grow up, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as\r\nyou and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up\r\nsuccessfully, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be my own fault if I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I feel\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t grow up right I can\xe2\x80\x99t go back and begin over again. I\xe2\x80\x99ve grown two\r\ninches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby\xe2\x80\x99s party. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nso glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty\r\nand it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie\r\nPye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to study better\r\nbecause of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my\r\nmind about that flounce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth something to have that,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Marilla.\r\n\r\nMiss Stacy came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager\r\nfor work once more. Especially did the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s class gird up their loins\r\nfor the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their\r\npathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Entrance,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their\r\nvery shoes. Suppose they did not pass! That thought was doomed to\r\nhaunt Anne through the waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons\r\ninclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological\r\nproblems. When Anne had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably\r\nat pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Gilbert Blythe\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nblazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all.\r\n\r\nBut it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was\r\nas interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. New worlds of\r\nthought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored\r\nknowledge seemed to be opening out before Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eager eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cHills peeped o\xe2\x80\x99er hill and Alps on Alps arose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of all this was due to Miss Stacy\xe2\x80\x99s tactful, careful, broadminded\r\nguidance. She led her class to think and explore and discover for\r\nthemselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree\r\nthat quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all\r\ninnovations on established methods rather dubiously.\r\n\r\nApart from her studies Anne expanded socially, for Marilla, mindful of\r\nthe Spencervale doctor\xe2\x80\x99s dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings.\r\nThe Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one\r\nor two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh\r\ndrives and skating frolics galore.\r\n\r\nBetween times Anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that Marilla was\r\nastonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the\r\ngirl was taller than herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Anne, how you\xe2\x80\x99ve grown!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost unbelievingly. A sigh\r\nfollowed on the words. Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne\xe2\x80\x99s inches.\r\nThe child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this\r\ntall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the\r\nproudly poised little head, in her place. Marilla loved the girl as much\r\nas she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful\r\nsense of loss. And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting\r\nwith Diana, Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the\r\nweakness of a cry. Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it\r\nand gazed at her in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking about Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got to be such a big\r\ngirl--and she\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be away from us next winter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss her\r\nterrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to come home often,\xe2\x80\x9d comforted Matthew, to whom Anne was\r\nas yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought home\r\nfrom Bright River on that June evening four years before. \xe2\x80\x9cThe branch\r\nrailroad will be built to Carmody by that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be the same thing as having her here all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed\r\nMarilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there--men can\xe2\x80\x99t understand these things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were other changes in Anne no less real than the physical change.\r\nFor one thing, she became much quieter. Perhaps she thought all the\r\nmore and dreamed as much as ever, but she certainly talked less. Marilla\r\nnoticed and commented on this also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t chatter half as much as you used to, Anne, nor use half as\r\nmany big words. What has come over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked\r\ndreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on\r\nthe creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know--I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk as much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, denting her\r\nchin thoughtfully with her forefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nicer to think dear, pretty\r\nthoughts and keep them in one\xe2\x80\x99s heart, like treasures. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nhave them laughed at or wondered over. And somehow I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to use\r\nbig words any more. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost a pity, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m really\r\ngrowing big enough to say them if I did want to. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun to be almost\r\ngrown up in some ways, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s so much to learn and do and think that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t time for big\r\nwords. Besides, Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and\r\nbetter. She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible. It was\r\nhard at first. I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I\r\ncould think of--and I thought of any number of them. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got used\r\nto it now and I see it\xe2\x80\x99s so much better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of your story club? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard you speak of it for\r\na long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story club isn\xe2\x80\x99t in existence any longer. We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time for\r\nit--and anyhow I think we had got tired of it. It was silly to be\r\nwriting about love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Stacy\r\nsometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own\r\nlives, and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own\r\ntoo. I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to\r\nlook for them myself. I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether,\r\nbut Miss Stacy said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself\r\nto be my own severest critic. And so I am trying to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only two more months before the Entrance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nthink you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get through?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne shivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sometimes I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right--and then I get\r\nhorribly afraid. We\xe2\x80\x99ve studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled us\r\nthoroughly, but we mayn\xe2\x80\x99t get through for all that. We\xe2\x80\x99ve each got a\r\nstumbling block. Mine is geometry of course, and Jane\xe2\x80\x99s is Latin, and\r\nRuby and Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s is algebra, and Josie\xe2\x80\x99s is arithmetic. Moody Spurgeon\r\nsays he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English\r\nhistory. Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as\r\nhard as we\xe2\x80\x99ll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have some idea. I wish it was all over, Marilla. It haunts me.\r\nSometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do if I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, go to school next year and try again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla unconcernedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99d have the heart for it. It would be such a\r\ndisgrace to fail, especially if Gil--if the others passed. And I get so\r\nnervous in an examination that I\xe2\x80\x99m likely to make a mess of it. I wish I\r\nhad nerves like Jane Andrews. Nothing rattles her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring\r\nworld, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things\r\nupspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book.\r\nThere would be other springs, but if she did not succeed in passing the\r\nEntrance, Anne felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently\r\nto enjoy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. The Pass List Is Out\r\n\r\n\r\n|WITH the end of June came the close of the term and the close of Miss\r\nStacy\xe2\x80\x99s rule in Avonlea school. Anne and Diana walked home that\r\nevening feeling very sober indeed. Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore\r\nconvincing testimony to the fact that Miss Stacy\xe2\x80\x99s farewell words must\r\nhave been quite as touching as Mr. Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s had been under similar\r\ncircumstances three years before. Diana looked back at the schoolhouse\r\nfrom the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\ndismally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to feel half as badly as I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, hunting vainly\r\nfor a dry spot on her handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be back again next winter,\r\nbut I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ve left the dear old school forever--if I have good\r\nluck, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be a bit the same. Miss Stacy won\xe2\x80\x99t be there, nor you nor Jane\r\nnor Ruby probably. I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nto have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly times, haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe, Anne? It\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful to think they\xe2\x80\x99re all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo big tears rolled down by Diana\xe2\x80\x99s nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would stop crying I could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne imploringly. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as\r\nsoon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off\r\nagain. As Mrs. Lynde says, \xe2\x80\x98If you can\xe2\x80\x99t be cheerful, be as cheerful as\r\nyou can.\xe2\x80\x99 After all, I dare say I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back next year. This is one\r\nof the times I _know_ I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pass. They\xe2\x80\x99re getting alarmingly\r\nfrequent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but those exams didn\xe2\x80\x99t make me nervous. When I think of the real\r\nthing you can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round\r\nmy heart. And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nunlucky. I am _not_ superstitious and I know it can make no difference.\r\nBut still I wish it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thirteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish I was going in with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we have\r\na perfectly elegant time? But I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to cram in the\r\nevenings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. She says\r\nit would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not\r\nthink about the exams at all and go to bed early. It\xe2\x80\x99s good advice, but\r\nI expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think.\r\nPrissy Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her\r\nEntrance week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up\r\n_at least_ as long as she did. It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to\r\nask me to stay at Beechwood while I\xe2\x80\x99m in town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll write to me while you\xe2\x80\x99re in, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,\xe2\x80\x9d promised\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be haunting the post office Wednesday,\xe2\x80\x9d vowed Diana.\r\n\r\nAnne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted\r\nthe post office, as agreed, and got her letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Diana\xe2\x80\x9d [wrote Anne],\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is Tuesday night and I\xe2\x80\x99m writing this in the library at\r\nBeechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and\r\nwished so much you were with me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98cram\xe2\x80\x99 because I\xe2\x80\x99d promised\r\nMiss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history\r\nas it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling\r\nfor Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands\r\nand they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t slept\r\na wink and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe I was strong enough to stand the grind\r\nof the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s course even if I did get through. There are times and\r\nseasons even yet when I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made any great headway in\r\nlearning to like Josie Pye!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from\r\nall over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting\r\non the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth\r\nhe was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over\r\nand over to steady his nerves and for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake not to interrupt\r\nhim, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot\r\neverything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts\r\nfirmly in their proper place!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and\r\nI sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of\r\nthe multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if\r\nI looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear\r\nacross the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English\r\nexamination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled\r\naround as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly\r\nas I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green\r\nGables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began\r\nbeating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I\r\nknew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in\r\nthe afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully\r\nmixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh,\r\nDiana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it\r\nit takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my\r\nEuclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would\r\nrecite it from now till tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody\r\nSpurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in\r\nhistory and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he\r\nwas going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a\r\ncarpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to\r\nstay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nSometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m always glad I\xe2\x80\x99m a girl and not his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just\r\ndiscovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When\r\nshe recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had\r\nbeen with us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as\r\nMrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I\r\nfail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99d rather it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go on if I failed!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours devotedly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and\r\nAnne arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of\r\nchastened triumph about her. Diana was over at Green Gables when she\r\narrived and they met as if they had been parted for years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou old darling, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly splendid to see you back again. It\r\nseems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get\r\nalong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment\r\nthat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the\r\ndearest, loveliest spot in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did the others do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girls say they know they didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass, but I think they did pretty\r\nwell. Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!\r\nMoody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he\r\nfailed in algebra. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t really know anything about it and won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nuntil the pass list is out. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be for a fortnight. Fancy living\r\na fortnight in such suspense! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake\r\nup until it is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana knew it would be useless to ask how Gilbert Blythe had fared, so\r\nshe merely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll pass all right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the\r\nlist,\xe2\x80\x9d flashed Anne, by which she meant--and Diana knew she meant--that\r\nsuccess would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of\r\nGilbert Blythe.\r\n\r\nWith this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the\r\nexaminations. So had Gilbert. They had met and passed each other on the\r\nstreet a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Anne\r\nhad held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly\r\nthat she had made friends with Gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a\r\nlittle more determinedly to surpass him in the examination. She knew\r\nthat all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she\r\neven knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question\r\nand that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert\r\nwould be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if\r\nshe failed.\r\n\r\nBut she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cpass high\xe2\x80\x9d for the sake of Matthew and Marilla--especially Matthew.\r\nMatthew had declared to her his conviction that she \xe2\x80\x9cwould beat the\r\nwhole Island.\xe2\x80\x9d That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to\r\nhope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she\r\nwould be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she\r\nfelt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient\r\ngrubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fortnight Anne took to \xe2\x80\x9chaunting\xe2\x80\x9d the post office\r\nalso, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the\r\nCharlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings\r\nas bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert\r\nwere not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he told Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me\r\nsuddenly whether I\xe2\x80\x99ve passed or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began\r\nto feel that she really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand the strain much longer. Her\r\nappetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished.\r\nMrs. Lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory\r\nsuperintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her\r\nhome from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if\r\nhe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t better vote Grit at the next election.\r\n\r\nBut one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window,\r\nfor the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the\r\nworld, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with\r\nflower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the\r\nstir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink\r\nfrom the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the\r\nspirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying\r\ndown through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a\r\nfluttering newspaper in her hand.\r\n\r\nAnne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The\r\npass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt\r\nher. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana\r\ncame rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even\r\nknocking, so great was her excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, you\xe2\x80\x99ve passed,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cpassed the _very first_--you and\r\nGilbert both--you\xe2\x80\x99re ties--but your name is first. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s bed, utterly\r\nbreathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,\r\noversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her\r\nshaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.\r\nYes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two\r\nhundred! That moment was worth living for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did just splendidly, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently\r\nto sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a\r\nword. \xe2\x80\x9cFather brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes\r\nago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won\xe2\x80\x99t be here\r\ntill tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over\r\nlike a wild thing. You\xe2\x80\x99ve all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon\r\nand all, although he\xe2\x80\x99s conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty\r\nwell--they\xe2\x80\x99re halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through\r\nwith three marks to spare, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll see she\xe2\x80\x99ll put on as many airs as\r\nif she\xe2\x80\x99d led. Won\xe2\x80\x99t Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel\r\nlike to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were\r\nme I know I\xe2\x80\x99d go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re as calm and cool as a spring evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just dazzled inside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to say a hundred things,\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this--yes, I\r\ndid too, just once! I let myself think _once_, \xe2\x80\x98What if I should come out\r\nfirst?\xe2\x80\x99 quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to\r\nthink I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run\r\nright out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go up the road and\r\ntell the good news to the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling\r\nhay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at\r\nthe lane fence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Matthew,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve passed and I\xe2\x80\x99m first--or one of the\r\nfirst! I\xe2\x80\x99m not vain, but I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I always said it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, gazing at the pass list\r\ndelightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you could beat them all easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done pretty well, I must say, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, trying to\r\nhide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s critical eye. But that\r\ngood soul said heartily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in\r\nsaying it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a credit to your friends, Anne, that\xe2\x80\x99s what, and we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall proud of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious\r\nlittle talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open\r\nwindow in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude\r\nand aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it\r\nthankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when\r\nshe slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and\r\nbeautiful as maidenhood might desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. The Hotel Concert\r\n\r\n\r\n|PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d advised Diana\r\ndecidedly.\r\n\r\nThey were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only\r\ntwilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless\r\nsky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into\r\nburnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet\r\nsummer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway\r\nvoices and laughter. But in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room the blind was drawn and the lamp\r\nlighted, for an important toilet was being made.\r\n\r\nThe east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that\r\nnight four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to\r\nthe marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept\r\nin, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and\r\ndainty a nest as a young girl could desire.\r\n\r\nThe velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams\r\nhad kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented\r\nthem. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that\r\nsoftened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of\r\npale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade\r\ntapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few\r\ngood pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy\xe2\x80\x99s photograph occupied\r\nthe place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh\r\nflowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly\r\nperfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no \xe2\x80\x9cmahogany\r\nfurniture,\xe2\x80\x9d but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a\r\ncushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,\r\na quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes\r\npainted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a\r\nlow white bed.\r\n\r\nAnne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had\r\ngot it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all\r\nthe available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it\r\nalong. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir\r\nhad been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a\r\nviolin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad;\r\nand Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to\r\nrecite.\r\n\r\nAs Anne would have said at one time, it was \xe2\x80\x9can epoch in her life,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in\r\nthe seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his\r\nAnne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather\r\nthan admit it, and said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was very proper for a lot\r\nof young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible\r\nperson with them.\r\n\r\nAnne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother\r\nBilly in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and\r\nboys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from\r\ntown, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think the organdy will be best?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Anne anxiously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it\r\ncertainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t so fashionable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut it suits you ever so much better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so soft\r\nand frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too\r\ndressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for\r\nnotable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much\r\nsought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular\r\nnight in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was\r\nforever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so\r\nher appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon\r\nAnne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and\r\ncombed and adorned to the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now\r\nfor your slippers. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to braid your hair in two thick braids,\r\nand tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don\xe2\x80\x99t pull out a single\r\ncurl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do\r\nyour hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a\r\nMadonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose\r\njust behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I put my pearl beads on?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cMatthew brought me a\r\nstring from town last week, and I know he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,\r\nand finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied\r\naround Anne\xe2\x80\x99s slim milk-white throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something so stylish about you, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, with\r\nunenvious admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hold your head with such an air. I suppose\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s your figure. I am just a dumpling. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been afraid of it,\r\nand now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign\r\nmyself to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have such dimples,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, smiling affectionately into the\r\npretty, vivacious face so near her own. \xe2\x80\x9cLovely dimples, like little\r\ndents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream\r\nwill never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncomplain. Am I all ready now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready,\xe2\x80\x9d assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt\r\nfigure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a\r\nmuch softer face. \xe2\x80\x9cCome right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she look lovely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I\r\nexpect she\xe2\x80\x99ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew\r\nwith it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmost unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when\r\nhe got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.\r\nTime was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for\r\nAnne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything\r\noff on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable,\r\nand Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear\r\nof the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Marilla stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Anne looked,\r\nwith that\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cOne moonbeam from the forehead to the crown\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nand regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her\r\ngirl recite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if it _is_ too damp for my dress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana, pulling up the window blind. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nperfect night, and there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any dew. Look at the moonlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, going\r\nover to Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so splendid to see the morning coming up over those\r\nlong hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. It\xe2\x80\x99s new every\r\nmorning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest\r\nsunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get along without it when I go to town next month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak of your going away tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d begged Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nthink of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time\r\nthis evening. What are you going to recite, Anne? And are you nervous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit. I\xe2\x80\x99ve recited so often in public I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all now.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to give \xe2\x80\x98The Maiden\xe2\x80\x99s Vow.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s so pathetic. Laura Spencer\r\nis going to give a comic recitation, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather make people cry than\r\nlaugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you recite if they encore you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t dream of encoring me,\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed Anne, who was not without her\r\nown secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself telling\r\nMatthew all about it at the next morning\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast table. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nBilly and Jane now--I hear the wheels. Come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBilly Andrews insisted that Anne should ride on the front seat with him,\r\nso she unwillingly climbed up. She would have much preferred to sit\r\nback with the girls, where she could have laughed and chattered to her\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s content. There was not much of either laughter or chatter\r\nin Billy. He was a big, fat, stolid youth of twenty, with a round,\r\nexpressionless face, and a painful lack of conversational gifts. But he\r\nadmired Anne immensely, and was puffed up with pride over the prospect\r\nof driving to White Sands with that slim, upright figure beside him.\r\n\r\nAnne, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally\r\npassing a sop of civility to Billy--who grinned and chuckled and never\r\ncould think of any reply until it was too late--contrived to enjoy the\r\ndrive in spite of all. It was a night for enjoyment. The road was full\r\nof buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear, echoed\r\nand reechoed along it. When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of\r\nlight from top to bottom. They were met by the ladies of the concert\r\ncommittee, one of whom took Anne off to the performers\xe2\x80\x99 dressing room\r\nwhich was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club,\r\namong whom Anne felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified. Her\r\ndress, which, in the east gable, had seemed so dainty and pretty, now\r\nseemed simple and plain--too simple and plain, she thought, among all\r\nthe silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her. What were her\r\npearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her?\r\nAnd how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse\r\nflowers the others wore! Anne laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank\r\nmiserably into a corner. She wished herself back in the white room at\r\nGreen Gables.\r\n\r\nIt was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel,\r\nwhere she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes,\r\nthe perfume and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down\r\nin the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid\r\ntime away at the back. She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink\r\nsilk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout\r\nlady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Anne\r\nthrough her eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so\r\nscrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl\r\nkept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the \xe2\x80\x9ccountry bumpkins\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and \xe2\x80\x9crustic belles\xe2\x80\x9d in the audience, languidly anticipating \xe2\x80\x9csuch fun\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n from the displays of local talent on the program. Anne believed that she\r\nwould hate that white-lace girl to the end of life.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the\r\nhotel and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a\r\nwonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems\r\non her neck and in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice\r\nand wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her\r\nselection. Anne, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the\r\ntime, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended\r\nshe suddenly put her hands over her face. She could never get up and\r\nrecite after that--never. Had she ever thought she could recite? Oh, if\r\nshe were only back at Green Gables!\r\n\r\nAt this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Anne--who did\r\nnot notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace\r\ngirl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied\r\ntherein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.\r\nShe was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s hands in nervous sympathy.\r\n\r\nAnne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as\r\nshe had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience\r\nas this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.\r\nEverything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of\r\nladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of\r\nwealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches\r\nat the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of\r\nfriends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless\r\ncritics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement\r\nfrom her \xe2\x80\x9crustic\xe2\x80\x9d efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and\r\nmiserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness\r\ncame over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would\r\nhave fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,\r\nmust ever after be her portion if she did so.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the\r\naudience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending\r\nforward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once\r\ntriumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert\r\nwas merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and\r\nof the effect produced by Anne\xe2\x80\x99s slender white form and spiritual face\r\nagainst a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had\r\ndriven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant\r\nand taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if\r\nshe had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage\r\nand determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would\r\nnot_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,\r\nnever, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her\r\nrecitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of\r\nthe room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored\r\nto her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness\r\nshe recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were\r\nbursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing\r\nwith shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken\r\nby the stout lady in pink silk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you did splendidly,\xe2\x80\x9d she puffed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying like a\r\nbaby, actually I have. There, they\xe2\x80\x99re encoring you--they\xe2\x80\x99re bound to\r\nhave you back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne confusedly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut yet--I must, or Matthew\r\nwill be disappointed. He said they would encore me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint Matthew,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pink lady, laughing.\r\n\r\nSmiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint,\r\nfunny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The\r\nrest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.\r\n\r\nWhen the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of\r\nan American millionaire--took her under her wing, and introduced her\r\nto everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional\r\nelocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that\r\nshe had a charming voice and \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreted\xe2\x80\x9d her selections beautifully.\r\nEven the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had\r\nsupper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane\r\nwere invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne,\r\nbut Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear\r\nof some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team,\r\nhowever, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into\r\nthe calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked\r\ninto the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.\r\n\r\nOh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!\r\nHow great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the\r\nsea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants\r\nguarding enchanted coasts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t it been a perfectly splendid time?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Jane, as they drove\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x9cI just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at\r\na hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and\r\nchicken salad every blessed day. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it would be ever so much\r\nmore fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great,\r\nalthough I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it\r\nwas better than Mrs. Evans\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t say things like that, Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nit sounds silly. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better than Mrs. Evans\xe2\x80\x99s, you know, for\r\nshe is a professional, and I\xe2\x80\x99m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack\r\nof reciting. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a compliment for you, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diana. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least I think it\r\nmust be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it\r\nwas anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a\r\nromantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he\r\nis a distinguished artist, and that her mother\xe2\x80\x99s cousin in Boston is\r\nmarried to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard\r\nhim say--didn\xe2\x80\x99t we, Jane?--\xe2\x80\x98Who is that girl on the platform with the\r\nsplendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.\xe2\x80\x99 There now,\r\nAnne. But what does Titian hair mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing interpreted it means plain red, I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cTitian\r\nwas a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nwere simply dazzling. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you just love to be rich, girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe _are_ rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne staunchly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we have sixteen years to our\r\ncredit, and we\xe2\x80\x99re happy as queens, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve all got imaginations, more\r\nor less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of\r\nthings not seen. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy its loveliness any more if we had\r\nmillions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change into any\r\nof those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl\r\nand wear a sour look all your life, as if you\xe2\x80\x99d been born turning up\r\nyour nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so\r\nstout and short that you\xe2\x80\x99d really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans,\r\nwith that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully\r\nunhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Jane\r\nAndrews!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ know--exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane unconvinced. \xe2\x80\x9cI think diamonds would\r\ncomfort a person for a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by\r\ndiamonds all my life,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite content to be Anne of\r\nGreen Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know Matthew gave me as\r\nmuch love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady\xe2\x80\x99s jewels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. A Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Girl\r\n\r\n\r\n|THE next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was\r\ngetting ready to go to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s, and there was much sewing to be done,\r\nand many things to be talked over and arranged. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s outfit was\r\nample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made\r\nno objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More--one\r\nevening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate\r\npale green material.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, here\xe2\x80\x99s something for a nice light dress for you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nyou really need it; you\xe2\x80\x99ve plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere\r\nof an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that\r\nJane and Ruby and Josie have got \xe2\x80\x98evening dresses,\xe2\x80\x99 as they call them,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me\r\npick it in town last week, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get Emily Gillis to make it for\r\nyou. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren\xe2\x80\x99t to be equaled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, it\xe2\x80\x99s just lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you so much. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve you ought to be so kind to me--it\xe2\x80\x99s making it harder every day\r\nfor me to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings\r\nas Emily\xe2\x80\x99s taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, and recited \xe2\x80\x9cThe Maiden\xe2\x80\x99s Vow\xe2\x80\x9d for them in the\r\nkitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful\r\nmotions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green\r\nGables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child\r\nin her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking\r\nout of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to\r\nMarilla\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne gaily\r\nstooping over Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheek. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I call that a positive triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t crying over your piece,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, who would have\r\nscorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. \xe2\x80\x9cI just\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And\r\nI was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your\r\nqueer ways. You\xe2\x80\x99ve grown up now and you\xe2\x80\x99re going away; and you look so\r\ntall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it\r\nall over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne sat down on Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s gingham lap, took Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s lined\r\nface between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit changed--not really. I\xe2\x80\x99m only just pruned down and\r\nbranched out. The real _me_--back here--is just the same. It won\xe2\x80\x99t make a\r\nbit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I\r\nshall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear\r\nGreen Gables more and better every day of her life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s faded one, and reached\r\nout a hand to pat Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Marilla would have given much just\r\nthen to have possessed Anne\xe2\x80\x99s power of putting her feelings into words;\r\nbut nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her\r\narms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing\r\nthat she need never let her go.\r\n\r\nMatthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went\r\nout-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked\r\nagitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I guess she ain\xe2\x80\x99t been much spoiled,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, proudly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the\r\nrest. She\xe2\x80\x99s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake\r\nthan what Mrs. Spencer made--if it _was_ luck. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it was any\r\nsuch thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I\r\nreckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day finally came when Anne must go to town. She and Matthew drove\r\nin one fine September morning, after a tearful parting with Diana and an\r\nuntearful practical one--on Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s side at least--with Marilla. But\r\nwhen Anne had gone Diana dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at\r\nWhite Sands with some of her Carmody cousins, where she contrived\r\nto enjoy herself tolerably well; while Marilla plunged fiercely into\r\nunnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of\r\nheartache--the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away\r\nin ready tears. But that night, when Marilla went to bed, acutely and\r\nmiserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the\r\nhall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft\r\nbreathing, she buried her face in her pillow, and wept for her girl in\r\na passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect\r\nhow very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature.\r\n\r\nAnne and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to\r\nhurry off to the Academy. That first day passed pleasantly enough in a\r\nwhirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the\r\nprofessors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne\r\nintended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss\r\nStacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a\r\nFirst Class teacher\xe2\x80\x99s license in one year instead of two, if they were\r\nsuccessful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby,\r\nJosie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the\r\nstirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.\r\nAnne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in\r\na room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the\r\ntall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion\r\nshe did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.\r\nYet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old\r\nrivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what\r\nto do if it had been lacking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable without it,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cGilbert looks\r\nawfully determined. I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s making up his mind, here and now, to\r\nwin the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never noticed it before.\r\nI do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I suppose I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted,\r\nthough. I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised Diana that\r\nno Queen\xe2\x80\x99s girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear\r\nto me as she is; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve lots of second-best affections to bestow. I\r\nlike the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist.\r\nShe looks vivid and red-rosy; there\xe2\x80\x99s that pale, fair one gazing out of\r\nthe window. She has lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two\r\nabout dreams. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know them both--know them well--well enough to\r\nwalk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. But just\r\nnow I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, and probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nknow me particularly. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s lonesome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was lonesomer still when Anne found herself alone in her hall bedroom\r\nthat night at twilight. She was not to board with the other girls, who\r\nall had relatives in town to take pity on them. Miss Josephine Barry\r\nwould have liked to board her, but Beechwood was so far from the\r\nAcademy that it was out of the question; so Miss Barry hunted up a\r\nboarding-house, assuring Matthew and Marilla that it was the very place\r\nfor Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Miss Barry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what sort\r\nof boarders she takes. Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons\r\nunder her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in\r\na quiet neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did\r\nnot materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized\r\nupon her. She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its\r\ndull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty\r\nbook-case; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of\r\nher own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant\r\nconsciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in\r\nthe garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the\r\nslope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a\r\nvast starry sky, and the light from Diana\xe2\x80\x99s window shining out through\r\nthe gap in the trees. Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that\r\noutside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone\r\nwires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand\r\nlights gleaming on stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry,\r\nand fought against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ cry. It\xe2\x80\x99s silly--and weak--there\xe2\x80\x99s the third tear splashing\r\ndown by my nose. There are more coming! I must think of something funny\r\nto stop them. But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing funny except what is connected with\r\nAvonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I\xe2\x80\x99m going home\r\nnext Friday, but that seems a hundred years away. Oh, Matthew is nearly\r\nhome by now--and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for\r\nhim--six--seven--eight--oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in counting them! They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncoming in a flood presently. I can\xe2\x80\x99t cheer up--I don\xe2\x80\x99t _want_ to cheer up.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s nicer to be miserable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not Josie Pye appeared\r\nat that moment. In the joy of seeing a familiar face Anne forgot that\r\nthere had never been much love lost between her and Josie. As a part of\r\nAvonlea life even a Pye was welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you came up,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne said sincerely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Josie, with aggravating pity. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re homesick--some people have so little self-control in that\r\nrespect. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\njolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so\r\nlong. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cry, Anne; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t becoming, for your nose and eyes\r\nget red, and then you seem _all_ red. I\xe2\x80\x99d a perfectly scrumptious time in\r\nthe Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache\r\nwould give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable\r\naround, Anne? I\xe2\x80\x99m literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla \xe2\x80\x98d\r\nload you up with cake. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I called round. Otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\ngone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards\r\nsame place as I do, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a sport. He noticed you in class today, and\r\nasked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that\r\nthe Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen before that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more\r\nsatisfactory than Josie Pye\xe2\x80\x99s companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared,\r\neach with an inch of Queen\xe2\x80\x99s color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned\r\nproudly to her coat. As Josie was not \xe2\x80\x9cspeaking\xe2\x80\x9d to Jane just then she\r\nhad to subside into comparative harmlessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if I\xe2\x80\x99d lived many moons since\r\nthe morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old\r\nprofessor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the\r\ntraces of tears. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying _do_ own up. It will restore my\r\nself-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll give me a teeny piece, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Thank you. It has the real\r\nAvonlea flavor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuby, perceiving the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s calendar lying on the table, wanted to know\r\nif Anne meant to try for the gold medal.\r\n\r\nAnne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that reminds me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Josie, \xe2\x80\x9cQueen\xe2\x80\x99s is to get one of the Avery\r\nscholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me--his\r\nuncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced\r\nin the Academy tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn Avery scholarship! Anne felt her heart beat more quickly, and the\r\nhorizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic. Before\r\nJosie had told the news Anne\xe2\x80\x99s highest pinnacle of aspiration had been\r\na teacher\xe2\x80\x99s provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and\r\nperhaps the medal! But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning\r\nthe Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and\r\ngraduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie\xe2\x80\x99s words\r\nhad died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt\r\nthat here her foot was on native heath.\r\n\r\nA wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his\r\nfortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed\r\namong the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,\r\naccording to their respective standings. There had been much doubt\r\nwhether one would be allotted to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s, but the matter was settled at\r\nlast, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark\r\nin English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred\r\nand fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder\r\nthat Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she resolved.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s delightful to\r\nhave ambitions. I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to\r\nbe any end to them--that\xe2\x80\x99s the best of it. Just as soon as you attain\r\nto one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does\r\nmake life so interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. The Winter at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\r\n\r\n|ANNE\xe2\x80\x99S homesickness wore off, greatly helped in the wearing by her\r\nweekend visits home. As long as the open weather lasted the Avonlea\r\nstudents went out to Carmody on the new branch railway every Friday\r\nnight. Diana and several other Avonlea young folks were generally on\r\nhand to meet them and they all walked over to Avonlea in a merry party.\r\nAnne thought those Friday evening gypsyings over the autumnal hills in\r\nthe crisp golden air, with the homelights of Avonlea twinkling beyond,\r\nwere the best and dearest hours in the whole week.\r\n\r\nGilbert Blythe nearly always walked with Ruby Gillis and carried her\r\nsatchel for her. Ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking\r\nherself quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long\r\nas her mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had\r\nto take it down when she went home. She had large, bright-blue eyes,\r\na brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure. She laughed a great\r\ndeal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of\r\nlife frankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would like,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n whispered Jane to Anne. Anne did not think so either, but she would not\r\nhave said so for the Avery scholarship. She could not help thinking,\r\ntoo, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert\r\nto jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and\r\nambitions. Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem\r\nthe sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed.\r\n\r\nThere was no silly sentiment in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s ideas concerning Gilbert. Boys\r\nwere to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good\r\ncomrades. If she and Gilbert had been friends she would not have cared\r\nhow many other friends he had nor with whom he walked. She had a genius\r\nfor friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague\r\nconsciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing\r\nto round out one\xe2\x80\x99s conceptions of companionship and furnish broader\r\nstandpoints of judgment and comparison. Not that Anne could have put her\r\nfeelings on the matter into just such clear definition. But she thought\r\nthat if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the\r\ncrisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and\r\nmerry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening\r\naround them and their hopes and ambitions therein. Gilbert was a clever\r\nyoung fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to\r\nget the best out of life and put the best into it. Ruby Gillis told Jane\r\nAndrews that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said;\r\nhe talked just like Anne Shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on\r\nand for her part she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it any fun to be bothering about books\r\nand that sort of thing when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. Frank Stockley had lots\r\nmore dash and go, but then he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t half as good-looking as Gilbert and\r\nshe really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t decide which she liked best!\r\n\r\nIn the Academy Anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about\r\nher, thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself. With the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crose-red\xe2\x80\x9d girl, Stella Maynard, and the \xe2\x80\x9cdream girl,\xe2\x80\x9d Priscilla Grant,\r\nshe soon became intimate, finding the latter pale spiritual-looking\r\nmaiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun, while the\r\nvivid, black-eyed Stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies,\r\nas aerial and rainbow-like as Anne\xe2\x80\x99s own.\r\n\r\nAfter the Christmas holidays the Avonlea students gave up going home\r\non Fridays and settled down to hard work. By this time all the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and\r\nthe various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of\r\nindividuality. Certain facts had become generally accepted. It was\r\nadmitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down\r\nto three--Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, and Lewis Wilson; the Avery\r\nscholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible\r\nwinner. The bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as\r\nwon by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a\r\npatched coat.\r\n\r\nRuby Gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the Academy; in the\r\nSecond Year classes Stella Maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with\r\nsmall but critical minority in favor of Anne Shirley. Ethel Marr was\r\nadmitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes\r\nof hair-dressing, and Jane Andrews--plain, plodding, conscientious\r\nJane--carried off the honors in the domestic science course. Even Josie\r\nPye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in\r\nattendance at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s. So it may be fairly stated that Miss Stacy\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\npupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course.\r\n\r\nAnne worked hard and steadily. Her rivalry with Gilbert was as intense\r\nas it had ever been in Avonlea school, although it was not known in the\r\nclass at large, but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it. Anne no\r\nlonger wished to win for the sake of defeating Gilbert; rather, for the\r\nproud consciousness of a well-won victory over a worthy foeman. It\r\nwould be worth while to win, but she no longer thought life would be\r\ninsupportable if she did not.\r\n\r\nIn spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times.\r\nAnne spent many of her spare hours at Beechwood and generally ate her\r\nSunday dinners there and went to church with Miss Barry. The latter was,\r\nas she admitted, growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the\r\nvigor of her tongue in the least abated. But she never sharpened the\r\nlatter on Anne, who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical\r\nold lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Anne-girl improves all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI get tired of other\r\ngirls--there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them. Anne\r\nhas as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while\r\nit lasts. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that she is as amusing as she was when she was\r\na child, but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love\r\nthem. It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, almost before anybody realized it, spring had come; out in\r\nAvonlea the Mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where\r\nsnow-wreaths lingered; and the \xe2\x80\x9cmist of green\xe2\x80\x9d was on the woods and in\r\nthe valleys. But in Charlottetown harassed Queen\xe2\x80\x99s students thought and\r\ntalked only of examinations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem possible that the term is nearly over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to--a whole winter\r\nof studies and classes. And here we are, with the exams looming up next\r\nweek. Girls, sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything, but\r\nwhen I look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and\r\nthe misty blue air at the end of the streets they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem half so\r\nimportant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane and Ruby and Josie, who had dropped in, did not take this view\r\nof it. To them the coming examinations were constantly very important\r\nindeed--far more important than chestnut buds or Maytime hazes. It was\r\nall very well for Anne, who was sure of passing at least, to have her\r\nmoments of belittling them, but when your whole future depended on\r\nthem--as the girls truly thought theirs did--you could not regard them\r\nphilosophically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost seven pounds in the last two weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nuse to say don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. I _will_ worry. Worrying helps you some--it\r\nseems as if you were doing something when you\xe2\x80\x99re worrying. It would be\r\ndreadful if I failed to get my license after going to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s all winter\r\nand spending so much money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Josie Pye. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t pass this year I\xe2\x80\x99m coming\r\nback next. My father can afford to send me. Anne, Frank Stockley says\r\nthat Professor Tremaine said Gilbert Blythe was sure to get the medal\r\nand that Emily Clay would likely win the Avery scholarship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may make me feel badly tomorrow, Josie,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just\r\nnow I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are coming out\r\nall purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns\r\nare poking their heads up in Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Lane, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a great deal of\r\ndifference whether I win the Avery or not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best and I begin\r\nto understand what is meant by the \xe2\x80\x98joy of the strife.\xe2\x80\x99 Next to trying\r\nand winning, the best thing is trying and failing. Girls, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk\r\nabout exams! Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses\r\nand picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark\r\nbeech-woods back of Avonlea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to wear for commencement, Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ruby\r\npractically.\r\n\r\nJane and Josie both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side\r\neddy of fashions. But Anne, with her elbows on the window sill, her soft\r\ncheek laid against her clasped hands, and her eyes filled with visions,\r\nlooked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome\r\nof sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden\r\ntissue of youth\xe2\x80\x99s own optimism. All the Beyond was hers with its\r\npossibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming years--each year a rose of\r\npromise to be woven into an immortal chaplet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. The Glory and the Dream\r\n\r\n\r\n|ON the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be\r\nposted on the bulletin board at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s, Anne and Jane walked down the\r\nstreet together. Jane was smiling and happy; examinations were over\r\nand she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least; further\r\nconsiderations troubled Jane not at all; she had no soaring ambitions\r\nand consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon. For\r\nwe pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although\r\nambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but\r\nexact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement.\r\nAnne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had\r\nwon the medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not\r\nseem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\xe2\x80\x99ll win one of them anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not hope of the Avery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody says Emily Clay\r\nwill win it. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to march up to that bulletin board and\r\nlook at it before everybody. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the moral courage. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nstraight to the girls\xe2\x80\x99 dressing room. You must read the announcements\r\nand then come and tell me, Jane. And I implore you in the name of our\r\nold friendship to do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just\r\nsay so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do _don\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nsympathize with me. Promise me this, Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for\r\nsuch a promise. When they went up the entrance steps of Queen\xe2\x80\x99s they\r\nfound the hall full of boys who were carrying Gilbert Blythe around on\r\ntheir shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices, \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for\r\nBlythe, Medalist!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment.\r\nSo she had failed and Gilbert had won! Well, Matthew would be sorry--he\r\nhad been so sure she would win.\r\n\r\nAnd then!\r\n\r\nSomebody called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree cheers for Miss Shirley, winner of the Avery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Jane, as they fled to the girls\xe2\x80\x99 dressing room amid\r\nhearty cheers. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then the girls were around them and Anne was the center of a\r\nlaughing, congratulating group. Her shoulders were thumped and her hands\r\nshaken vigorously. She was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all\r\nshe managed to whisper to Jane:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, won\xe2\x80\x99t Matthew and Marilla be pleased! I must write the news home\r\nright away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCommencement was the next important happening. The exercises were held\r\nin the big assembly hall of the Academy. Addresses were given, essays\r\nread, songs sung, the public award of diplomas, prizes and medals made.\r\n\r\nMatthew and Marilla were there, with eyes and ears for only one student\r\non the platform--a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed\r\ncheeks and starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and\r\nwhispered about as the Avery winner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReckon you\xe2\x80\x99re glad we kept her, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Matthew, speaking\r\nfor the first time since he had entered the hall, when Anne had finished\r\nher essay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been glad,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do like\r\nto rub things in, Matthew Cuthbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked\r\nMarilla in the back with her parasol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you proud of that Anne-girl? I am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnne went home to Avonlea with Matthew and Marilla that evening. She had\r\nnot been home since April and she felt that she could not wait another\r\nday. The apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young.\r\nDiana was at Green Gables to meet her. In her own white room, where\r\nMarilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill, Anne looked\r\nabout her and drew a long breath of happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Diana, it\xe2\x80\x99s so good to be back again. It\xe2\x80\x99s so good to see those\r\npointed firs coming out against the pink sky--and that white orchard and\r\nthe old Snow Queen. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the breath of the mint delicious? And that tea\r\nrose--why, it\xe2\x80\x99s a song and a hope and a prayer all in one. And it\xe2\x80\x99s _good_\r\nto see you again, Diana!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDiana reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cJosie Pye told me you did. Josie said you were\r\n_infatuated_ with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne laughed and pelted Diana with the faded \xe2\x80\x9cJune lilies\xe2\x80\x9d of her\r\nbouquet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are\r\nthat one, Diana,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you more than ever--and I\xe2\x80\x99ve so many\r\nthings to tell you. But just now I feel as if it were joy enough to sit\r\nhere and look at you. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired, I think--tired of being studious and\r\nambitious. I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the\r\norchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done splendidly, Anne. I suppose you won\xe2\x80\x99t be teaching now that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve won the Avery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Redmond in September. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem wonderful? I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three\r\nglorious, golden months of vacation. Jane and Ruby are going to teach.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid to think we all got through even to Moody Spurgeon and\r\nJosie Pye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDiana. \xe2\x80\x9cGilbert Blythe is going to teach, too. He has to. His father\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means\r\nto earn his own way through. I expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll get the school here if Miss\r\nAmes decides to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise. She had not\r\nknown this; she had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond\r\nalso. What would she do without their inspiring rivalry? Would not\r\nwork, even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be\r\nrather flat without her friend the enemy?\r\n\r\nThe next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck Anne that Matthew was\r\nnot looking well. Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hesitatingly when he had gone out, \xe2\x80\x9cis Matthew quite\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla in a troubled tone. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s had some real\r\nbad spells with his heart this spring and he won\xe2\x80\x99t spare himself a mite.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been real worried about him, but he\xe2\x80\x99s some better this while back\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good hired man, so I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping he\xe2\x80\x99ll kind of rest and\r\npick up. Maybe he will now you\xe2\x80\x99re home. You always cheer him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne leaned across the table and took Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not looking as well yourself as I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you, Marilla.\r\nYou look tired. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working too hard. You must take\r\na rest, now that I\xe2\x80\x99m home. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to take this one day off to\r\nvisit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will\r\nbe your turn to be lazy while I do the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla smiled affectionately at her girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the work--it\xe2\x80\x99s my head. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pain so often now--behind\r\nmy eyes. Doctor Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s been fussing with glasses, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nme any good. There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the\r\nlast of June and the doctor says I must see him. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t read or sew with any comfort now. Well, Anne, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done real\r\nwell at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s I must say. To take First Class License in one year and\r\nwin the Avery scholarship--well, well, Mrs. Lynde says pride goes before\r\na fall and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the higher education of women at all;\r\nshe says it unfits them for woman\xe2\x80\x99s true sphere. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word\r\nof it. Speaking of Rachel reminds me--did you hear anything about the\r\nAbbey Bank lately, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard it was shaky,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what Rachel said. She was up here one day last week and said\r\nthere was some talk about it. Matthew felt real worried. All we have\r\nsaved is in that bank--every penny. I wanted Matthew to put it in the\r\nSavings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s and he\xe2\x80\x99d always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him\r\nat the head of it was good enough for anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he has only been its nominal head for many years,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAnne. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the\r\ninstitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money\r\nright out and he said he\xe2\x80\x99d think of it. But Mr. Russell told him\r\nyesterday that the bank was all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world. She\r\nnever forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free\r\nfrom shadow and so lavish of blossom. Anne spent some of its rich hours\r\nin the orchard; she went to the Dryad\xe2\x80\x99s Bubble and Willowmere and Violet\r\nVale; she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan;\r\nand finally in the evening she went with Matthew for the cows, through\r\nLovers\xe2\x80\x99 Lane to the back pasture. The woods were all gloried through\r\nwith sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill\r\ngaps in the west. Matthew walked slowly with bent head; Anne, tall and\r\nerect, suited her springing step to his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been working too hard today, Matthew,\xe2\x80\x9d she said reproachfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t you take things easier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, as he opened the yard gate\r\nto let the cows through. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only that I\xe2\x80\x99m getting old, Anne, and keep\r\nforgetting it. Well, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always worked pretty hard and I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\ndrop in harness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been the boy you sent for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne wistfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be able\r\nto help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways. I could find it\r\nin my heart to wish I had been, just for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have you than a dozen boys, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew\r\npatting her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cJust mind you that--rather than a dozen boys. Well\r\nnow, I guess it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it? It\r\nwas a girl--my girl--my girl that I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard. Anne took the\r\nmemory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a\r\nlong while at her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the\r\nfuture. Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine;\r\nthe frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope. Anne always\r\nremembered the silvery, peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night.\r\nIt was the last night before sorrow touched her life; and no life is\r\never quite the same again when once that cold, sanctifying touch has\r\nbeen laid upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. The Reaper Whose Name Is Death\r\n\r\n\r\n|MATTHEW--Matthew--what is the matter? Matthew, are you sick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word. Anne came through\r\nthe hall, her hands full of white narcissus,--it was long before Anne\r\ncould love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,--in time to hear\r\nher and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper\r\nin his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray. Anne dropped her\r\nflowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as\r\nMarilla. They were both too late; before they could reach him Matthew\r\nhad fallen across the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s fainted,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Marilla. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne, run for Martin--quick, quick!\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s at the barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office,\r\nstarted at once for the doctor, calling at Orchard Slope on his way to\r\nsend Mr. and Mrs. Barry over. Mrs. Lynde, who was there on an errand,\r\ncame too. They found Anne and Marilla distractedly trying to restore\r\nMatthew to consciousness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his pulse, and then laid her\r\near over his heart. She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and\r\nthe tears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think--we can do anything for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lynde, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think--you can\xe2\x80\x99t think Matthew is--is--\xe2\x80\x9d Anne\r\ncould not say the dreadful word; she turned sick and pallid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChild, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of it. Look at his face. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that\r\nlook as often as I have you\xe2\x80\x99ll know what it means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great\r\nPresence.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and\r\nprobably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock. The\r\nsecret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper Matthew had held\r\nand which Martin had brought from the office that morning. It contained\r\nan account of the failure of the Abbey Bank.\r\n\r\nThe news spread quickly through Avonlea, and all day friends and\r\nneighbors thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness\r\nfor the dead and living. For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert\r\nwas a person of central importance; the white majesty of death had\r\nfallen on him and set him apart as one crowned.\r\n\r\nWhen the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was\r\nhushed and tranquil. In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin,\r\nhis long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little\r\nkindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. There were\r\nflowers about him--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had\r\nplanted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which Matthew\r\nhad always had a secret, wordless love. Anne had gathered them and\r\nbrought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white\r\nface. It was the last thing she could do for him.\r\n\r\nThe Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to\r\nthe east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Diana.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne looked earnestly into her friend\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink you won\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nafraid. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to\r\nbe. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrealize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can\xe2\x80\x99t be dead; and\r\nthe other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had this horrible dull ache ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiana did not quite understand. Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s impassioned grief, breaking\r\nall the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush,\r\nshe could comprehend better than Anne\xe2\x80\x99s tearless agony. But she went\r\naway kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnne hoped that the tears would come in solitude. It seemed to her a\r\nterrible thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had\r\nloved so much and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked\r\nwith her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below\r\nwith that awful peace on his brow. But no tears came at first, even when\r\nshe knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the\r\nstars beyond the hills--no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of\r\nmisery that kept on aching until she fell asleep, worn out with the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s pain and excitement.\r\n\r\nIn the night she awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about\r\nher, and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of\r\nsorrow. She could see Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s face smiling at her as he had smiled\r\nwhen they parted at the gate that last evening--she could hear his voice\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy girl--my girl that I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the tears came and\r\nAnne wept her heart out. Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--there--don\xe2\x80\x99t cry so, dearie. It can\xe2\x80\x99t bring him back.\r\nIt--it--isn\xe2\x80\x99t right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit then. He\xe2\x80\x99d always been such a good, kind brother to me--but God knows\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just let me cry, Marilla,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tears don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me\r\nlike that ache did. Stay here for a little while with me and keep your\r\narm round me--so. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have Diana stay, she\xe2\x80\x99s good and kind and\r\nsweet--but it\xe2\x80\x99s not her sorrow--she\xe2\x80\x99s outside of it and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome close enough to my heart to help me. It\xe2\x80\x99s our sorrow--yours and\r\nmine. Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got each other, Anne. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99d do if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhere--if you\xe2\x80\x99d never come. Oh, Anne, I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been kind of strict and\r\nharsh with you maybe--but you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love you as well as\r\nMatthew did, for all that. I want to tell you now when I can. It\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nbeen easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s easier. I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ve been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead\r\nthreshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had\r\nloved and the trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its\r\nusual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old\r\ngroove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before,\r\nalthough always with the aching sense of \xe2\x80\x9closs in all familiar things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so--that\r\nthey _could_ go on in the old way without Matthew. She felt something like\r\nshame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs\r\nand the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of\r\ngladness when she saw them--that Diana\xe2\x80\x99s visits were pleasant to her\r\nand that Diana\xe2\x80\x99s merry words and ways moved her to laughter and\r\nsmiles--that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and\r\nfriendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her\r\nheart, that life still called to her with many insistent voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in\r\nthese things now that he has gone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said wistfully to Mrs. Allan\r\none evening when they were together in the manse garden. \xe2\x80\x9cI miss him so\r\nmuch--all the time--and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very\r\nbeautiful and interesting to me for all. Today Diana said something\r\nfunny and I found myself laughing. I thought when it happened I could\r\nnever laugh again. And it somehow seems as if I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know\r\nthat you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nAllan gently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is just away now; and he likes to know it just the\r\nsame. I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing\r\ninfluences that nature offers us. But I can understand your feeling.\r\nI think we all experience the same thing. We resent the thought that\r\nanything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share\r\nthe pleasure with us, and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our\r\nsorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s grave\r\nthis afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne dreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cI took a slip of the little white\r\nScotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago; Matthew\r\nalways liked those roses the best--they were so small and sweet on\r\ntheir thorny stems. It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his\r\ngrave--as if I were doing something that must please him in taking it\r\nthere to be near him. I hope he has roses like them in heaven. Perhaps\r\nthe souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many\r\nsummers were all there to meet him. I must go home now. Marilla is all\r\nalone and she gets lonely at twilight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be lonelier still, I fear, when you go away again to college,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mrs. Allan.\r\n\r\nAnne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to green\r\nGables. Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down\r\nbeside her. The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch\r\nshell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.\r\n\r\nAnne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in\r\nher hair. She liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial\r\nbenediction, above her every time she moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Spencer was here while you were away,\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says\r\nthat the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must\r\ngo in and have my eyes examined. I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d better go and have it\r\nover. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind\r\nof glasses to suit my eyes. You won\xe2\x80\x99t mind staying here alone while I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\naway, will you? Martin will have to drive me in and there\xe2\x80\x99s ironing and\r\nbaking to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be all right. Diana will come over for company for me. I shall\r\nattend to the ironing and baking beautifully--you needn\xe2\x80\x99t fear that I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstarch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne. You were\r\nalways getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do\r\nyou mind the time you dyed your hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed. I shall never forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled Anne, touching the heavy\r\nbraid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. \xe2\x80\x9cI laugh a little\r\nnow sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me--but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh _much_, because it was a very real trouble then. I did suffer\r\nterribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles are really gone; and\r\npeople are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now--all but Josie\r\nPye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder\r\nthan ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked\r\nme if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalmost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made what I\r\nwould once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n_be_ liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJosie is a Pye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cso she can\xe2\x80\x99t help being\r\ndisagreeable. I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in\r\nsociety, but I must say I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is any more than I know the\r\nuse of thistles. Is Josie going to teach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she is going back to Queen\xe2\x80\x99s next year. So are Moody Spurgeon and\r\nCharlie Sloane. Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got\r\nschools--Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d--briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nice-looking fellow he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla absently. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him in\r\nchurch last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot like\r\nhis father did at the same age. John Blythe was a nice boy. We used to\r\nbe real good friends, he and I. People called him my beau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked up with swift interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla--and what happened?--why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a quarrel. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive him when he asked me to. I meant\r\nto, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him\r\nfirst. He never came back--the Blythes were all mighty independent. But\r\nI always felt--rather sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always kind of wished I\xe2\x80\x99d forgiven him\r\nwhen I had the chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a bit of romance in your life, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so to look at\r\nme, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides.\r\nEverybody has forgot about me and John. I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten myself. But it all\r\ncame back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. The Bend in the road\r\n\r\n\r\n|MARILLA went to town the next day and returned in the evening. Anne had\r\ngone over to Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in\r\nthe kitchen, sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand.\r\nSomething in her dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne\xe2\x80\x99s heart. She\r\nhad never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very tired, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--no--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla wearily, looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\r\nam tired but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the oculist? What did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anne anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all\r\nreading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,\r\nand if I\xe2\x80\x99m careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he\xe2\x80\x99s given me\r\nhe thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.\r\nBut if I don\xe2\x80\x99t he says I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be stone-blind in six months.\r\nBlind! Anne, just think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was\r\nsilent. It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said\r\nbravely, but with a catch in her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are\r\ncareful you won\xe2\x80\x99t lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure\r\nyour headaches it will be a great thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t call it much hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to live\r\nfor if I can\xe2\x80\x99t read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well\r\nbe blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help that when I get\r\nlonesome. But there, it\xe2\x80\x99s no good talking about it. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll get me\r\na cup of tea I\xe2\x80\x99ll be thankful. I\xe2\x80\x99m about done out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything\r\nabout this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear that folks\r\nshould come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then\r\nAnne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the\r\ndarkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly\r\nthings had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!\r\nThen she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy\r\nwith promise. Anne felt as if she had lived years since then, but before\r\nshe went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.\r\nShe had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a\r\nfriend--as duty ever is when we meet it frankly.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front\r\nyard where she had been talking to a caller--a man whom Anne knew by\r\nsight as Sadler from Carmody. Anne wondered what he could have been\r\nsaying to bring that look to Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in\r\nher eyes in defiance of the oculist\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition and her voice broke as\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy it! Buy Green Gables?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne wondered if she had heard aright. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nMarilla, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to sell Green Gables!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else is to be done. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it all over.\r\nIf my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after\r\nthings and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I may\r\nlose my sight altogether; and anyway I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be fit to run things. Oh,\r\nI never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d live to see the day when I\xe2\x80\x99d have to sell my home.\r\nBut things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till\r\nnobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank;\r\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises\r\nme to sell the farm and board somewhere--with her I suppose. It won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbring much--it\xe2\x80\x99s small and the buildings are old. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be enough\r\nfor me to live on I reckon. I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful you\xe2\x80\x99re provided for with that\r\nscholarship, Anne. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you won\xe2\x80\x99t have a home to come to in your\r\nvacations, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, but I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll manage somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla broke down and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t sell Green Gables,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne resolutely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne, I wish I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. But you can see for yourself. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stay here alone. I\xe2\x80\x99d go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my\r\nsight would go--I know it would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t have to stay here alone, Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be with you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ngoing to Redmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot going to Redmond!\xe2\x80\x9d Marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and\r\nlooked at Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I say. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take the scholarship. I decided so\r\nthe night after you came home from town. You surely don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could\r\nleave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry\r\nwants to rent the farm for next year. So you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any bother over\r\nthat. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to teach. I\xe2\x80\x99ve applied for the school here--but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to\r\nGilbert Blythe. But I can have the Carmody school--Mr. Blair told me\r\nso last night at the store. Of course that won\xe2\x80\x99t be quite as nice or\r\nconvenient as if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and\r\ndrive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And\r\neven in winter I can come home Fridays. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a horse for that. Oh,\r\nI have it all planned out, Marilla. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll read to you and keep you\r\ncheered up. You sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be dull or lonesome. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be real cozy and\r\nhappy here together, you and I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla had listened like a woman in a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know. But I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t let you sacrifice yourself so for me. It would be terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne laughed merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no sacrifice. Nothing could\r\nbe worse than giving up Green Gables--nothing could hurt me more. We\r\nmust keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99m _not_\r\ngoing to Redmond; and I _am_ going to stay here and teach. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry\r\nabout me a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your ambitions--and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just as ambitious as ever. Only, I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed the object of my\r\nambitions. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a good teacher--and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to save your\r\neyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little\r\ncollege course all by myself. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve dozens of plans, Marilla. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best, and\r\nI believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nfuture seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought\r\nI could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what lies around the bend, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to believe that the\r\nbest does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder\r\nhow the road beyond it goes--what there is of green glory and\r\nsoft, checkered light and shadows--what new landscapes--what new\r\nbeauties--what curves and hills and valleys further on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I ought to let you give it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla,\r\nreferring to the scholarship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sixteen and a half, \xe2\x80\x98obstinate as a\r\nmule,\xe2\x80\x99 as Mrs. Lynde once told me,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marilla, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou go pitying me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be pitied, and there is no need\r\nfor it. I\xe2\x80\x99m heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green\r\nGables. Nobody could love it as you and I do--so we must keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou blessed girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla, yielding. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if you\xe2\x80\x99d given me\r\nnew life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college--but\r\nI know I can\xe2\x80\x99t, so I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to try. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it up to you though,\r\nAnne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up\r\nthe idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there\r\nwas a good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not\r\nknowing about Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did\r\nnot. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure\r\nto the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening\r\nand found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,\r\nscented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down\r\nand the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled\r\nthe dewy air.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the\r\ndoor, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a\r\nlong breath of mingled weariness and relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare I\xe2\x80\x99m getting glad to sit down. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on my feet all day,\r\nand two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,\r\nAnne, I hear you\xe2\x80\x99ve given up your notion of going to college. I was\r\nreal glad to hear it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got as much education now as a woman can be\r\ncomfortable with. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in girls going to college with the men\r\nand cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAnne laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to take my Arts course right here at Green\r\nGables, and study everything that I would at college.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Shirley, you\xe2\x80\x99ll kill yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to overdo\r\nthings. As \xe2\x80\x98Josiah Allen\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x99 says, I shall be \xe2\x80\x98mejum\xe2\x80\x99. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nvocation for fancy work. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to teach over at Carmody, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know it. I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re going to teach right here in Avonlea.\r\nThe trustees have decided to give you the school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lynde!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\r\nthought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it\r\nhe went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,\r\nyou know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested\r\nthat they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of\r\ncourse he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must\r\nsay I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. Real\r\nself-sacrificing, too, for he\xe2\x80\x99ll have his board to pay at White Sands,\r\nand everybody knows he\xe2\x80\x99s got to earn his own way through college. So the\r\ntrustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came\r\nhome and told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that I ought to take it,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean--I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent him now. He\xe2\x80\x99s signed papers with the White\r\nSands trustees. So it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do him any good now if you were to\r\nrefuse. Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll take the school. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get along all right,\r\nnow that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a\r\ngood thing she was, that\xe2\x80\x99s what. There\xe2\x80\x99s been some Pye or other going to\r\nAvonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in\r\nlife was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn\xe2\x80\x99t their home.\r\nBless my heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry\r\ngable mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiana is signaling for me to go over,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know we keep\r\nup the old custom. Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry\r\nshadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal more of the woman about her in others,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nMarilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.\r\n\r\nBut crispness was no longer Marilla\xe2\x80\x99s distinguishing characteristic. As\r\nMrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarilla Cuthbert has got _mellow_. That\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh\r\nflowers on Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She lingered\r\nthere until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place,\r\nwith its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its\r\nwhispering grasses growing at will among the graves. When she finally\r\nleft it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining\r\nWaters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike\r\nafterlight--\xe2\x80\x9ca haunt of ancient peace.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a freshness in the\r\nair as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home\r\nlights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay\r\nthe sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west\r\nwas a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in\r\nstill softer shadings. The beauty of it all thrilled Anne\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and\r\nshe gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old world,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very lovely, and I am glad to\r\nbe alive in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the\r\nBlythe homestead. It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he\r\nrecognized Anne. He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed\r\non in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with scarlet cheeks, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to thank you for\r\ngiving up the school for me. It was very good of you--and I want you to\r\nknow that I appreciate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGilbert took the offered hand eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be\r\nable to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after\r\nthis? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nit. What a stubborn little goose I was. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been--I may as well make a\r\ncomplete confession--I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sorry ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to be the best of friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gilbert, jubilantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nwere born to be good friends, Anne. You\xe2\x80\x99ve thwarted destiny enough. I\r\nknow we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your\r\nstudies, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? So am I. Come, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to walk home with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was that came up the lane with you, Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGilbert Blythe,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. \xe2\x80\x9cI met\r\nhim on Barry\xe2\x80\x99s hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marilla with a\r\ndry smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t been--we\xe2\x80\x99ve been good enemies. But we have decided that it\r\nwill be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we\r\nreally there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,\r\nwe have five years\xe2\x80\x99 lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.\r\nThe wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came\r\nup to her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and\r\nDiana\xe2\x80\x99s light gleamed through the old gap.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after\r\ncoming home from Queen\xe2\x80\x99s; but if the path set before her feet was to be\r\nnarrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.\r\nThe joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship\r\nwere to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her\r\nideal world of dreams. And there was always the bend in the road!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s in his heaven, all\xe2\x80\x99s right with the world,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Anne\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x80\x99s Anne of Green Gables, by Lucy Maud Montgomery\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ANNE OF GREEN GABLES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 45-0.txt or 45-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/45/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger and Charles Keller\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
