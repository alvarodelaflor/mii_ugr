      beloved, who was a dawn unto his own day, had waited twelve years in the
      city of Orphalese for his ship that was to return and bear him back to the
      isle of his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the twelfth year, on the seventh day of Ielool, the month of
      reaping, he climbed the hill without the city walls and looked seaward;
      and he beheld his ship coming with the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the gates of his heart were flung open, and his joy flew far over the
      sea. And he closed his eyes and prayed in the silences of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he descended the hill, a sadness came upon him, and he thought in
      his heart:
    </p>
    <p>
      How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in
      the spirit shall I leave this city. <span class="pagenum">8</span><a
      name="link8" id="link8"></a>Long were the days of pain I have spent within
      its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from
      his pain and his aloneness without regret?
    </p>
    <p>
      Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets, and
      too many are the children of my longing that walk naked among these hills,
      and I cannot withdraw from them without a burden and an ache.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a garment I cast off this day, but a skin that I tear with my
      own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger
      and with thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I cannot tarry longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark.
    </p>
    <p>
      For to stay, though the hours burn in the night, is to freeze and
      crystallize and be bound in a mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fain would I take with me all that is here. But how shall I?
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice cannot carry the tongue and <span class="pagenum">9</span><a
      name="link9" id="link9"></a>the lips that gave it wings. Alone must it
      seek the ether.
    </p>
    <p>
      And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when he reached the foot of the hill, he turned again towards the sea,
      and he saw his ship approaching the harbour, and upon her prow the
      mariners, the men of his own land.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his soul cried out to them, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      Sons of my ancient mother, you riders of the tides,
    </p>
    <p>
      How often have you sailed in my dreams. And now you come in my awakening,
      which is my deeper dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ready am I to go, and my eagerness with sails full set awaits the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only another breath will I breathe in this still air, only another loving
      look cast backward,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I shall stand among you, a seafarer among seafarers. <span
      class="pagenum">10</span><a name="link10" id="link10"></a>And you, vast
      sea, sleepless mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream,
    </p>
    <p>
      Only another winding will this stream make, only another murmur in this
      glade,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then shall I come to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he walked he saw from afar men and women leaving their fields and
      their vineyards and hastening towards the city gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he heard their voices calling his name, and shouting from field to
      field telling one another of the coming of his ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall the day of parting be the day of gathering?
    </p>
    <p>
      And shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn?
    </p>
    <p>
      And what shall I give unto him who has left his plough in midfurrow, or to
      him who has stopped the wheel of his winepress? <span class="pagenum">11</span><a
      name="link11" id="link11"></a>Shall my heart become a tree heavy-laden
      with fruit that I may gather and give unto them?
    </p>
    <p>
      And shall my desires flow like a fountain that I may fill their cups?
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I a harp that the hand of the mighty may touch me, or a flute that his
      breath may pass through me?
    </p>
    <p>
      A seeker of silences am I, and what treasure have I found in silences that
      I may dispense with confidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is my day of harvest, in what fields have I sowed the seed, and in
      what unremembered seasons?
    </p>
    <p>
      If this indeed be the hour in which I lift up my lantern, it is not my
      flame that shall burn therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Empty and dark shall I raise my lantern,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the guardian of the night shall fill it with oil and he shall light it
      also.

      These things he said in words. But much in his heart remained unsaid. For

      And when he entered into the city all the people came to meet him, and
      they were crying out to him as with one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the elders of the city stood forth and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      Go not yet away from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noontide have you been in our twilight, and your youth has given us
      dreams to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      No stranger are you among us, nor a guest, but our son and our dearly
      beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffer not yet our eyes to hunger for your face.

      And the priests and the priestesses said unto him:
    </p>
    <p>
      Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent
      in our midst become a memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have walked among us a spirit, <span class="pagenum">13</span><a
      name="link13" id="link13"></a>and your shadow has been a light upon our
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much have we loved you. But speechless was our love, and with veils has it
      been veiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet now it cries aloud unto you, and would stand revealed before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of
      separation.

      And others came also and entreated him. But he answered them not. He only
      bent his head; and those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the
      temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra. And
      she was a seeress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness, for it was she who had
      first sought and believed in him when he had been but a day in their city.
      <span class="pagenum">14</span><a name="link14" id="link14"></a>And she
      hailed him, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      Prophet of God, in quest of the uttermost, long have you searched the
      distances for your ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now your ship has come, and you must needs go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place
      of your greater desires; and our love would not bind you nor our needs
      hold you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and
      it shall not perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness
      you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been
      shown you of that which is between birth and death.

    <p>
      And he answered,

    <p>
      People of Orphalese, of what can I <span class="pagenum">15</span><a
      name="link15" id="link15"></a>speak save of that which is even now moving
      within your souls?

    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      Then said Almitra, Speak to us of <b><i>Love</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a
      stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      When love beckons to you, follow him,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though his ways are hard and steep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he speaks to you believe in him,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for
      your growth so is he for your pruning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he ascends to your height and <span class="pagenum">16</span><a
      name="link16" id="link16"></a>caresses your tenderest branches that quiver
      in the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
      So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threshes you to make you naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sifts you to free you from your husks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinds you to whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kneads you until you are pliant;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred
      bread for God&rsquo;s sacred feast.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of
      your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if in your fear you would seek only love&rsquo;s peace and love&rsquo;s
      pleasure,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it is better for you that you cover <span class="pagenum">17</span><a
      name="link17" id="link17"></a>your nakedness and pass out of love&rsquo;s
      threshing-floor,
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your
      laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.

    <p>
      Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;
    </p>
    <p>
      For love is sufficient unto love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you love you should not say, &ldquo;God is in my heart,&rdquo; but
      rather, &ldquo;I am in the heart of God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you
      worthy, directs your course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:
    </p>
    <p>
      To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
      <span class="pagenum">18</span><a name="link18" id="link18"></a>To know
      the pain of too much tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be wounded by your own understanding of love;
    </p>
    <p>
      And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of
      loving;
    </p>
    <p>
      To rest at the noon hour and meditate love&rsquo;s ecstacy;
    </p>
    <p>
      To return home at eventide with gratitude;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song
      of praise upon your lips.

    <p>
      Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fill each other&rsquo;s cup but drink not from one cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. <span

      together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,

    <p>
      You may house their bodies but not their souls,

      You give but little when you give of your possessions.

      It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.

    <p>
      For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you
      may need them tomorrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying
      bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is fear of need but need itself?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is
      unquenchable?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are those who give little of the <span class="pagenum">24</span><a

      for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are those who have little and give it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer

    <p>
      There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.

      They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into

    <p>
      And to the open-handed the search for <span class="pagenum">25</span><a

      The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.

      Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights, is worthy of

      And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill
      his cup from your little stream.

      And who are you that men should rend <span class="pagenum">26</span><a

      may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?
    </p>
    <p>
      See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of
      giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in truth it is life that gives unto life&mdash;while you, who deem
      yourself a giver, are but a witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you receivers&mdash;and you are all receivers&mdash;assume no weight
      of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;
    </p>
    <p>
      For to be overmindful of your debt, is ito doubt his generosity who has
      the freehearted earth for mother, and God for father.

      When you kill a beast say to him in your heart,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the same power that slays you, I too am slain; and I too shall
      be consumed. <span class="pagenum">28</span><a name="link28" id="link28"></a>For
      the law that delivered you into my hand shall deliver me into a mightier
      hand.

    <p>
      Your blood and my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of
      heaven.&rdquo;

    <p>
      And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your seeds shall live in my body,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,
    </p>
    <p>
      And your fragrance shall be my breath, And together we shall rejoice
      through all the seasons.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the autumn, when you gather the grapes of your vineyards for the
      winepress, say in your heart,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too am a vineyard, and my fruit shall be gathered for the
      winepress,
    </p>
    <p>
      And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in winter, when you draw the wine, <span class="pagenum">29</span><a
      name="link29" id="link29"></a>let there be in your heart a song for each
      cup;
    </p>
    <p>
      And let there be in the song a remembrance for the autumn days, and for
      the vineyard, and for the winepress.

      <span class="pagenum">30</span><a name="link30" id="link30"></a> Then a
      ploughman said, Speak to us of <b><i>Work</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out
      of life&rsquo;s procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission
      towards the infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the
      hours turns to music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings
      together in unison?
    </p>
    <p>
      Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth&rsquo;s
      furthest dream, <span class="pagenum">31</span><a name="link31" id="link31"></a>assigned
      to you when that dream was born,
    </p>
    <p>
      And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,
    </p>
    <p>
      And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life&rsquo;s inmost
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the
      flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the
      sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you
      echo what was said by the weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I say that life is indeed darkness &lsquo;save when there is urge,
    </p>
    <p>
      And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,
    </p>
    <p>
      And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,
    </p>
    <p>
      And all work is empty save when there is love;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you work with love you bind <span class="pagenum">32</span><a
      name="link32" id="link32"></a>yourself to yourself, and to one another,
      and to God.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is it to work with love?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if
      your beloved were to wear that cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to
      dwell in that house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as
      if your beloved were to eat the fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,
    </p>
    <p>
      And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, &ldquo;He who works
      in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is nobler
      than he who ploughs the soil. <span class="pagenum">33</span><a
      name="link33_rdquo_________id_" id="link33_rdquo_________id_"></a>And he
      who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is
      more than he who makes the sandals for our feet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I say, not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide, that the
      wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all
      the blades of grass;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made
      sweeter by his own loving.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Work is love made visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that
      you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms
      of those who work with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that
      feeds but half man&rsquo;s hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison
      in the wine. <span class="pagenum">34</span><a name="link34" id="link34"></a>And
      if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man&rsquo;s
      ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.

      woman said, Speak to us of <b><i>Joy and Sorrow</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled
      with your tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how else can it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can
      contain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the
      potter&rsquo;s oven?
    </p>
    <p>
      And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was
      hollowed with knives?
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is
      only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are sorrowful look again in <span class="pagenum">36</span><a
      name="link36" id="link36"></a>your heart, and you shall see that in truth
      you are weeping for that which has been your delight.

      Some of you say, &ldquo;Joy is greater than sorrow,&rdquo; and others say,
      &ldquo;Nay, sorrow is the greater.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board,
      remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs
      must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.

      mason came forth and said, Speak to us of <b><i>Houses</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      Build of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house
      within the city walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      For even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in
      you, the ever distant and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your house is your larger body.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is
      not dreamless. Does not your house dream? and dreaming, leave the city for
      grove or hilltop?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower
      scatter them in forest and meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that
      you <span class="pagenum">38</span><a name="link38" id="link38"></a>might
      seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the
      earth in your garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these things are not yet to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that
      fear shall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls
      separate your hearths from your fields.

    <p>
      And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses? And what
      is it you guard with fastened doors?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the
      mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and
      stone to the holy mountain?
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me, have you these in your houses?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing
      that <span class="pagenum">39</span><a name="link39" id="link39"></a>enters
      the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master?

    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of
      your larger desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of
      the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like
      fragile vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then
      walks grinning in the funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped
      nor tamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It shall not be a glistening film that <span class="pagenum">40</span><a
      name="link40" id="link40"></a>covers a wound, but an eyelid that guards
      the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend
      your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe
      lest walls should crack and fall down.
    </p>
    <p>
      You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though of magnificence and splendour, your house shall not hold your
      secret nor shelter your longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose
      door is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and the silences
      of night.

    <p>
      And he answered:

    <p>
      Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the
      unbeautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in
      them a harness and a chain.

      Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and
      less of your raiment,
    </p>

      For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the
      wind.

      And I say, Ay, it was the north wind,

    <p>
      But shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when his work was done he laughed in the forest. <span class="pagenum">42</span><a
      name="link42" id="link42"></a>Forget not that modesty is for a shield

      And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and

    <p>
      And he answered and said:

    <p>
      To you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know
      how to fill your hands.

    <p>
      It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance
      and be satisfied.

      some to greed and others to hunger.

      sanctify the scales and the reckoning that weighs value against value.
      <span class="pagenum">44</span><a name="link44" id="link44"></a>And suffer
      not the barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell

      To such men you should say,

      For they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense, and that which they
      bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul.

    <p>
      And before you leave the market place, see that no one has gone his way
      with empty hands.

      It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind,

      That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore
      unto yourself.

    <p>
      And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at
      the gate of the blessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the ocean is your god-self;
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains for ever undefiled.

      It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.
      <span class="pagenum">46</span><a name="link46" id="link46"></a>But your

    </p>

      Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man,

      But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the

      And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution

      Ay, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer of
      foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.

      And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:

      The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,

      And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,

    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself
      and worship your own freedom,
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he
      slays them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have
      seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire
      of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak
      of freedom as a goal and a fulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your
      <span class="pagenum">55</span><a name="link55" id="link55"></a>nights
      without a want and a grief,
    </p>
    <p>
      But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them
      naked and unbound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the
      chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around
      your noon hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains,
      though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you
      may become free?
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your
      own hand upon your own forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads
      of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if it is a despot you would <span class="pagenum">56</span><a
      name="link56" id="link56"></a>dethrone, see first that his throne erected
      within you is destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in
      their own freedom and a shame in their own pride?
    </p>
    <p>
      And if it is a care you would cast off, that cart has been chosen by you
      rather than imposed upon you.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your
      heart and not in the hand of the feared.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the
      desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and
      that which you would escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a
      shadow to another light.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter
      of a greater freedom.

      <span class="pagenum">57</span><a name="link57" id="link57"></a>And the
      priestess spoke again and said: Speak to us of <b><i>Reason and Passion</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason and your
      judgment wage war against your passion and your appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the
      discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the
      lovers of all your elements?
    </p>
    <p>
      Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your
      seafaring soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift,
      or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas. <span class="pagenum">58</span><a
      name="link58" id="link58"></a>For reason, ruling alone, is a force
      confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that
      it may sing;
    </p>
    <p>
      And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live
      through its own daily resurrection, and like the phoenix rise above its
      own ashes.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you
      would two loved guests in your house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more
      mindful of one loses the love and the faith of both
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars,
      sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows&mdash;then
      let your heart say in silence, &ldquo;God rests in reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the storm comes, and the <span class="pagenum">59</span><a
      name="link59" id="link59"></a>mighty wind shakes the forest, and thunder
      and lightning proclaim the majesty of the sky,&mdash;then let your heart
      say in awe, &ldquo;God moves in passion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And since you are a breath in God&rsquo;s sphere, and a leaf in God&rsquo;s
      forest, you too should rest in reason and move in passion.

    </p>
    <p>
      And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the
      sun, so must you know pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your
      life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;
    </p>
    <p>
      And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always
      accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of your pain is self-chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the bitter potion by which the physician <span class="pagenum">61</span><a
      name="link61" id="link61"></a>within you heals your sick self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and
      tranquillity: For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender
      hand of the Unseen, And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has
      been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own

    <p>
      And he answered, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart&rsquo;s knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.

      You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is well you should.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to

    <p>
      And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;
    </p>
    <p>
      And seek not the depths of your <span class="pagenum">63</span><a

      Your friend is your needs answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he is your board and your fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the &ldquo;nay&rdquo; in
      your own mind, nor do you withhold the &ldquo;ay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;
    </p>
    <p>
      For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all
      expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you part from your friend, you grieve not;
    </p>
    <p>
      For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the
      mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain. <span class="pagenum">67</span><a
      name="link67" id="link67"></a>And let there be no purpose in friendship
      save the deepening of the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not
      love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And let your best be for your friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?
    </p>
    <p>
      Seek him always with hours to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of
      pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is
      refreshed.

      <span class="pagenum">68</span><a name="link68" id="link68"></a>And then a
      scholar said, Speak of <b><i>Talking</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in
      your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold
      its wings but cannot fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they
      would escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are those who talk, and <span class="pagenum">69</span><a
      name="link69" id="link69"></a>without knowledge or forethought reveal a
      truth which they themselves do not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not
      in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the
      spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;
    </p>
    <p>
      For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is
      remembered
    </p>
    <p>
      When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">70</span><a name="link70" id="link70"></a>And an
      astronomer said, Master, what of <b><i>Time</i></b>?
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      You would measure time the measureless and the immeasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would adjust your conduct and even direct the course of your spirit
      according to hours and seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of time you would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch
      its flowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the timeless in you is aware of life&rsquo;s timelessness,
    </p>
    <p>
      And knows that yesterday is but today&rsquo;s memory and tomorrow is today&rsquo;s
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that that which sings and contemplates in you is still dwelling within
      the bounds of that first moment which scattered the stars into space.
      <span class="pagenum">71</span><a name="link71" id="link71"></a>Who among
      you does not feel that his power to love is boundless?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet who does not feel that very love, though boundless, encompassed
      within the centre of his being, and moving not from love thought to love
      thought, nor from love deeds to other love deeds?
    </p>
    <p>
      And is not time even as love is, undivided and paceless?

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But if in your thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season
      encircle all the other seasons,
    </p>
    <p>
      And let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with
      longing.

      <span class="pagenum">72</span><a name="link72" id="link72"></a>And one of
      the elders of the city said, Speak to us of <b><i>Good and Evil</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?
    </p>
    <p>
      Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it
      thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are good when you are one with yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet
      sink not to the bottom. <span class="pagenum">73</span><a
      name="link73_rdquo_________id_" id="link73_rdquo_________id_"></a>You are
      good when you strive to give of yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth
      and sucks at her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, &ldquo;Be like me, ripe and full
      and ever giving of your abundance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You are good when you are fully awake in your speech,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping. <span class="pagenum">74</span><a
      name="link74" id="link74"></a>Even those who limp go not backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you who are strong and swift, see that you do not limp before the
      lame, deeming it kindness.

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not
      good,
    </p>
    <p>
      You are only loitering and sluggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing
      is in all of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the
      sea, carrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends
      and lingers before it reaches the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let not him who longs much say to <span class="pagenum">75</span><a
      name="link75" id="link75"></a>him who longs little, &ldquo;Wherefore are
      you slow and halting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the truly good ask not the naked, &ldquo;Where is your garment?&rdquo;
      nor the houseless, &ldquo;What has befallen your house?&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">76</span><a name="link76" id="link76"></a>Then a
      priestess said, Speak to us of <b><i>Prayer</i></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he answered, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      You pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also
      in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what is prayer but the expansion of yourself into the living ether?
    </p>
    <p>
      And if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space, it is also
      for your delight to pour forth the dawning of your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer, she
      should spur you again and yet again, though weeping, until you shall come
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that
      very <span class="pagenum">77</span><a name="link77" id="link77"></a>hour,
      and whom save in prayer you may not meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but
      ecstasy and sweet communion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For if you should enter the temple for no other purpose than asking you
      shall not receive:
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be
      lifted:
    </p>
    <p>
      Or even if you should enter into it to beg for the good of others you
      shall not be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is enough that you enter the temple invisible.
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot teach you how to pray in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      God listens not to your words save when He Himself utters them through
      your lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I cannot teach you the prayer of the seas and the forests and the
      mountains. <span class="pagenum">78</span><a name="link78" id="link78"></a>But
      you who are born of the mountains and the forests and the seas can find
      their prayer in your heart,
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them
      saying in silence,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our God, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that
      willeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thy desire in us that desireth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into
      days which are thine also.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are
      born in us:
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou art our need; and in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all.&rdquo;

    <p>
      And he answered, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasure is a freedom-song,
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the blossoming of your desires,
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not their fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a depth calling unto a height,
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not the deep nor the high.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the caged taking wing,
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not space encompassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart; yet I would not
      have you lose your hearts in the singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged
      and rebuked. <span class="pagenum">80</span><a name="link80" id="link80"></a>I
      would not judge nor rebuke them. I would have them seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven are her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots and
      found a treasure?

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs
      committed in drunkenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But regret is the beclouding of the mind and not its chastisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      They should remember their pleasures with gratitude, as they would the
      harvest of a summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them be comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to
      remember;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in their fear of seeking and remembering <span class="pagenum">81</span><a
      name="link81" id="link81"></a>they shun all pleasures, lest they neglect
      the spirit or offend against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in their foregoing is their pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus they too find a treasure though they dig for roots with quivering
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But tell me, who is he that can offend the spirit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of the night, or the firefly
      the stars?
    </p>
    <p>
      And shall your flame or your smoke burden the wind?
    </p>
    <p>
      Think you the spirit is a still pool which you can trouble with a staff?

    <p>
      Who knows but that which seems omitted today, waits for tomorrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even your body knows its heritage and its rightful need and will not be
      deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      And your body is the harp of your soul,
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is yours to bring forth <span class="pagenum">82</span><a

      is good in pleasure from that which is not good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to your fields and your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the
      pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower,
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life,
    </p>
    <p>
      And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love,
    </p>
    <p>
      And to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a
      need and an ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.

      Where shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself

    </p>
    <p>
      And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?
    </p>
    <p>
      The aggrieved and the injured say, &ldquo;Beauty is kind and gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the passionate say, &ldquo;Nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tired and the weary say, &ldquo;Beauty is of soft whisperings. She
      speaks in our spirit. <span class="pagenum">84</span><a name="link84"

      And in the summer heat the reapers say, &ldquo;We have seen her dancing
      with the autumn leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her hair.&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">85</span><a name="link85" id="link85"></a>All these
      things have you said of beauty,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,
    </p>
    <p>
      And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth,
    </p>
    <p>
      But rather a heart enflamed and a soul enchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear,
    </p>
    <p>
      But rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear
      though you shut your ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw,

      flight.

      People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.

    <p>
      But you are life and you are the veil. <span class="pagenum">86</span><a

      Have I spoken this day of aught else?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not religion all deeds and all reflection,

      And that which is neither deed nor reflection, but a wonder and a surprise

      Your daily life is your temple and your religion.

      Whenever you enter into it take with you your all.

      Take the plough and the forge and the mallet and the lute,

    <p>
      The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.

    <p>
      For in revery you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than

      Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children.

    <p>
      And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching
      His arms in the lightning and descending in rain.

      You would know the secret of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?
    </p>
    <p>
      The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the

    </p>
    <p>
      If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto
      the body of life.

    <p>
      For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.

    <p>
      In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the
      beyond;
    </p>
    <p>
      And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.

      And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its
      restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.

      And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.

      And he reached his ship and stood upon the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      And facing the people again, he raised his voice and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      People of Orphalese, the wind bids me leave you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less hasty am I than the wind, yet I must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have
      ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us. <span
      class="pagenum">93</span><a name="link93" id="link93"></a>Even while the
      earth sleeps we travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our
      fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered.

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Brief were my days among you, and briefer still the words I have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But should my voice fade in your ears, and my love vanish in your memory,
      then I will come again,
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a richer heart and lips more yielding to the spirit will I speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, I shall return with the tide,
    </p>
    <p>
      And though death may hide me, and the greater silence enfold me, yet again
      will I seek your understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not in vain will I seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      If aught I have said is truth, that truth shall reveal itself in a clearer
      voice, and in words more kin to your thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not down into emptiness;
      <span class="pagenum">94</span><a name="link94" id="link94"></a>And if
      this day is not a fulfilment of your needs and my love, then let it be a
      promise till another day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man&rsquo;s needs change, but not his love, nor his desire that his love
      should satisfy his needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Know therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in the fields, shall
      rise and gather into a cloud and then fall down in rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not unlike the mist have I been.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets, and my spirit
      has entered your houses,
    </p>
    <p>
      And your heart-beats were in my heart, and your breath was upon my face,
      and I knew you all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, I knew your joy and your pain, and in your sleep your dreams were my
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      And oftentimes I was among you a lake among the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mirrored the summits in you and the <span class="pagenum">95</span><a
      name="link95" id="link95"></a>bending slopes, and even the passing flocks
      of your thoughts and your desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to my silence came the laughter of your children in streams, and the
      longing of your youths in rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they reached my depth the streams and the rivers ceased not yet
      to sing.

      But sweeter still than laughter and greater than longing came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the boundless in you;

    <p>
      The vast man in whom you are all but cells and sinews;
    </p>
    <p>
      He in whose chant all your singing is but a soundless throbbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the vast man that you are vast,
    </p>
    <p>
      And in beholding him that I beheld you and loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere?
    </p>
    <p>
      What visions, what expectations and what presumptions can outsoar that
      flight?
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is the vast man in you.
      <span class="pagenum">96</span><a name="link96" id="link96"></a>His might

      This is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link.
    </p>
    <p>
      To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by
      the frailty of its foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their
      inconstancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, you are like an ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
      And though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even
      like an ocean, you cannot hasten your tides.
    </p>
    <p>
      And like the seasons you are also,
    </p>
    <p>
      And though in your winter you deny your spring,

      Yet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness and is not

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hunter was also the hunted;
    </p>
    <p>
      For many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the flier was also the creeper;
    </p>
    <p>
      For when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon the earth was a
      turtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I the believer was also the doubter; <span class="pagenum">102</span><a
      name="link102" id="link102"></a>For often have I put my finger in my own
      wound that I might have the greater belief in you and the greater
      knowledge of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is with this belief and this knowledge that I say,
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not enclosed within your bodies, nor confined to houses or fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which is you dwells above the mountain and roves with the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a thing that crawls into the sun for warmth or digs holes into
      darkness for safety,
    </p>
    <p>
      But a thing free, a spirit that envelops the earth and moves in the ether.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these be vague words, then seek not to clear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vague and nebulous is the beginning of all things, but not their end,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I fain would have you remember me as a beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life, and all that lives, is conceived in the mist and not in the crystal.
      <span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>And who
      knows but a crystal is mist in decay?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This would I have you remember in remembering me:
    </p>
    <p>
      That which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is the strongest and
      most determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your
      bones?
    </p>
    <p>
      And is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that
      builded your city and fashioned all there is in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Could you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all
      else,
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wove it,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that
      kneaded it. <span class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>And
      you shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you shall hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet you shall not deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been
      deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things,
    </p>
    <p>
      And you shall bless darkness as you would bless light.
    </p>
    <p>
      After saying these things he looked about him, and he saw the pilot of his
      ship standing by the helm and gazing now at the full sails and now at the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      Patient, over patient, is the captain of my ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind blows, and restless are the sails;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the rudder begs direction;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet quietly my captain awaits my silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these my mariners, who have heard the choir of the greater sea, they
      too have heard me patiently. <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>Now they shall wait no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stream has reached the sea, and once more the great mother holds her
      son against her breast.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Fare you well, people of Orphalese.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day has ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is closing upon us even as the water-lily upon its own tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was given us here we shall keep,
    </p>
    <p>
      And if it suffices not, then again must we come together and together
      stretch our hands unto the giver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forget not that I shall come back to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam for another
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall
      bear me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farewell to you and the youth I have spent with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but yesterday we met in a dream. <span class="pagenum">106</span><a
      name="link106" id="link106"></a>You have sung to me in my aloneness, and I
      of your longings have built a tower in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now our sleep has fled and our dream is over, and it is no longer
      dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noontide is upon us and our half waking has turned to fuller day, and
      we must part.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in the twilight of memory we should meet once more, we shall speak
      again together and you shall sing to me a deeper song.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if our hands should meet in another dream we shall build another tower
      in the sky.
    </p>

      So saying he made a signal to the seamen, and straightway they weighed
      anchor and cast the ship loose from its moorings, and they moved eastward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a cry came from the people as from a single heart, and it rose into
      the dusk and was carried out over the sea like a great trumpeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Almitra was silent, gazing after <span class="pagenum">107</span><a

      mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when all the people were dispersed she still stood alone upon the
      sea-wall, remembering in her heart his saying,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
